i wish the management company would listen to me and fire them
overall i am happy with my ring and felt i could trust this place not to rip me off
i knew i needed to replace the grass in my backyard but when matt asked what else i wanted done i turned the reins over to him and the result is beautiful  new walkways new stepping stones lights and drip system  he even bricked over the bbq so it matches which turned out to be a complete nuisance but he never once complained

some small damages from the move but we requested them not to wrap anything to save on time
i used this company today to have my ro system serviced
not only did he do it for free but i was able to bike so much easier the last 20 minutes home
they are so knowledgeable and have always been straight forward letting me know when it is wise to upgrade and when it would be a waste to the point where i almost feel guilty for getting such good and cheap advice
i think it would be cheaper to bring a nanny from home next time and have them stay with us to enjoy vegas
the service is always mediocre
the company followed through on everything promised with the installer arriving at the property on time and sending paperwork showing the down payment as well as the final installment

5 natures bin is the only place where ive noticed this tiny preportioned amounts of produce
also if they restore factory settings then it is a pain to wait to get everything recovered

then he cleaned the housing and burners and charged us only for the new ignitor
just fyi  they do come inside your home  office to work
art galleries and craft stores line the outer edge including bergo designs basically an art galleryretail store of industrial design
most food served was very tasty
just a friendly little operation that i will definitely be using again
overall if you need a neighborhood cleaner this place should be a candidate

maybe she should have looked at the diamonds on my fingers and neck before coming to me with nothing more than a no seriously when it was determined that my bracelet could not be fixed
ive finally found a tailor that can do the job right
rons and the shops story as a family owned and operated business certainly resonates with me as the daughter of smallbusiness owners i love to see the  little guy make it against the corporate giants

wurde ich im apple restore im breuningerland sindelfingen immer bestens bedient und beraten hat das erlebnis heute im neuen apple store dem fass den boden rausgehauen
i met a coworker here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed it
he said he understood
when it came in it was more beautiful than i could have imagined
we even had a coupon to a place offering additional payment for cans but couldnt find reviews or details about the business online
it will probably have most of what you need but the distance from the city the price and the behavior and attitudes of management dont make it that great of a deal
i had to call four times and schedule an appointment
are out in force and getting a dui isnt a good way to end a great day
5 stars for service and professionalism
must pay at drop off but things are normally ready in 24 hours at no extra cost
this is a wonderful place and they really care about the environment
at least not compared to other services we have used
i cant imagine that being a deal breaker in a hiring decision but it could be one of those attention to details things that looks a little bad
this business has a great model
worst swapmeet ever low quality crap for too much money
i chose to use this company for my move after reading the great reviews they had received here on yelp
rating it 3 stars because of style of food not because of quality which i am sure is good
staff ive ever have to deal with in a post office
our downstairs area smells like cheese on the carpet
i dont think any other dry cleaner that ive ever met has done this
but i rented an apartment and got my belongings out of here quick
she clearly likes dealing with men more than women
they were very respectful and even went above and beyond their job to help me pack my kitchen living room bedroom and bathroom
but i needed help on few repairs
jose interacts in a genuine honest and friendly manner and they offer faircompetitive prices for the high quality work they do
great work and cheap
cory the guy bernatt is not one bit personable
i said that i am the only person living my life who has a need so it matters to me
we couldnt beat that
we had to work longdistance but he accomplished the needed repairs quickly well and reasonably priced
sooo basically you lied when you told me that the teenagers were signed in the adult column
not only is the owner completely unethical but he is also arrogant and rude
i dont believe its in an easy to access neighborhood or in the best area for a large group of young kids
i cant recommend them more highly
they cracked the casing on the back of my phone
they gave honest feedback of what their customers usually get and though i didnt buy anything this visit they offered me ways i could try out other products from a list of sellers and manufacturers along with phone numbers to ask about similar options and i could do more research on the available options before purchasing
everything else is ok stuff is very nice and our children had fun
he could have easily pulled out the battery and mopped up the water that had seeped under it
however somebody offered me help right away
they will give you a high quote in hopes that you buy a new machine
very good at what they do
thanks to shane for being so helpful
halo called me 2 times to follow up and see if i still wanted the pup but i felt i had enough on my plate with the 2 month old puppy i adopted
he wasnt pushy at all
think of the time devoted
volunteers pack bags of food for kids who do have a meal when they get home at night or for the weekends they are out of school
once again i am happy with the apple store  their people
i also liked that jim provides all the new necessary lines pipes and pan plus he stands behind his work
next they forgot our pickup time and call me an hour after they were supposed to be at our house and say we just noticed on the invoice that the pickup time was 1100 do you still want us to pickup your stuff
i took a bracelet to them and they lowballed me  45 whent to super pawn and i got 75 that is a big difference
i would have continued with the service if it hadnt been for this last negative experience on the phone
do not use these guys
as my husband gets an employee discount with apple we were expecting to have to buy online or go to that other store
they have a lot of machines and barely anyone is in there
he completed the job in under 90 minutes cleaned the work area removing all replacedused parts and we completed the transition for what i felt was a fair price they take cash checks or credit cards
if youre interested in the local tech scene you need to check out notman house
i purchased additional insurance for this purpose and trying to get them to pay up was fruitless
no one has hours as convenient as this
never used the laundry services just the repairs and such
scheduling was no problem and communication was good
and after a week his new phone screen started acting up so he brought it back but they replaced his screen again for free
12 emails later to her 4 phone calls to the office staff and another 3 emails to them all done today and still no resolve
thank you rowan and appliance works
beware i wouldnt wish this stench on my worst enemys belongings
i was taken care of pleasantly and efficiently
you can see a video of how completely unusable my ipad is after their repair here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsroz5yk9ogk
everything is labeled and orderly to prevent mixups
i am not an apple fan
so my delivery was timely the produce was in good shape the final price was within a couple of dollars or so of the estimated price they have to allow for produce weight and substitutions so you dont know the exact full price until its delivered and the delivery guy was friendly and professional
a truly professional job indeed
will definitely use them again if i have to move they made my life so much easier but hopefully i dont have to move anytime soon though
i called several times again before i could get anyone to talk to and finally an appointment was scheduled for the additional repairs
the owner is so nice and the people he has working for them are incredible
if quality is what youre looking for and efficiently quick services come here
and my advice for the next guy karma is a bitch  and she has no deadline
how havent i raved about camelback moving yet
i have not yet begun my mission to destroy this company
would definitely go here again
in this case it was a drinking fountain
she was beyond helpful and wellspoken
i got everything back the same day and it was in perfect condition  why pay more when you have a great experience like that
jim and tim showed up 10 minutes early and were fantastic
all in all this is a great little place
i bought my first one back in 2008 when i bought my first house
we breathed a sigh of relief
its a little over whelming when you first get there because there is people everywhere and there is just random tables but nothing to check in at

i rented both units for the price of a 10x10
i know where im coming from now on

this is the least i could do

the guy who came to our house on staurday afternoon was crazy
very important if you happen to see the odd exotic bug
alex fixed my lap top by replacing its hard drive to a new one which i picked up at the time when it was promised to me but i was out of all my very important data after going back and forth of different options i agreed for alex to recover my data

i listened as an employee patiently provided information and offered apologies for the limitations of his role
the owners used our account information and charged us the 997 for tuition even though we decided not to enroll my son and they were provided with notice that he would not attend
i would say that some of the accessories like locks can be found cheaper at the aforementioned general store or amazon but it is convenient to get everything together for sure
these guys are great

i will take it somewhere else and see if it can be fixed

i called appliance works based on the reviews i read on yelp
the promise of returning for any unforeseen problems was reassuring
ive always had superior customer service by a knowledgeable staff
the staff at this location is very friendly
it seems like service has become something of a lost art but not at happy cleaners
all for what
when i got there they said itll probably take 30 minutes one problem my work was 20 away so i really didnt have time
the owners allow you to use your creditdebit card to buy quarters which is so convenient

so the girl behind the counter notifies me that she has change which i promptly hand her a 20 and say can i get like two dollars worth of change
i would think the techs would have some knowledge of where to spray and what products to use when they come to a housebut the techs were asking me what i want them to do
i also had him wire and mount all my tvs along with him adding surround sound to my living room tv

so dont expect any customer service but i cant comment on how your clothes will turn out
i went in because my iphone screen was getting weird on me and i assumed it was a bad screen but andre wanted to be sure so i wouldnt be replacing a perfectly good screen and spending money needlessly  if it was something else so he tested it and sorry to say it was the screen but he had it changed in 15min

im pretty sure that debi and her staff told everyone to write a review since my 1 star review rated the entire school since i was the only one that has reviewed the school
unfortunately they do cash only which raised another eyebrow so i had to show the atm withdrawal from the ampm right next door for roughly the purchase amount
luckily i escaped with only minor scrapes and bruises
i cant recommend gemsetter enough
perhaps they get a lot of customers who get angry right away and that is why they were so quick to the defense but i wasnt upset so this was offputting

i got one shirt back that had some weird marks on it first time in a year of using them and after contacting them they did my next order for free

to begin after going through an itembyitem incredibly detailed description of the contents of my onebedroom apartment i was given a quote on what i would require for square footage on their truck and a price that included packing and shipping that was significantly better than every other company i had spoken with

i agree with other reviewers that don farr deserves negative stars
but fear not
i was extremely pleased

the class instructors always mix it up and we get an amazing workout
after watching him go i soon realized that this guy is a pro and i am sweating bullets about how close i was to doing scratch that trying this myself
if youre looking for an affordable great doggie daycare this is the place
last time they fixed my expensive winterhiking boots so it gave it another season in service
this is my first time using uhaul the manager at the desk was the best
that really wouldve been great
he was informative timely and super friendly
my poor son was crying and trying to get someones attention to get back into the class and no one even noticed him
in fact they were going to charge me to move the smaller tire to the rear so it would ride better
but even if im not buying i walk out knowing more than i did when i walked in phil is a great player extremely knowledgeable about the music industry and loves to share what he knows with his customers
very fair prices and no hidden fees

the turn around time is really quick too and i have tendency to bring in a lot of clothes at once
when i went here to print via the computers available for public use via a reloadable store card the employee who loaded the card and got me started made me feel like i was stupid for not knowing how to insert the card and get their old windows 2000 fired up for use and printing
i cannot begin to thank them enough
my couch looks great
getting the job done at a great price is a huge win but what really set ryan and free green apart from all the other companies is the honesty and service
the quality of the alterations is fantastic and if theres a problem they fix it immediately
we would definitely call him again
we stand by our review of both oneguard and their contractors
i dropped off my wedding gown on the arranged date and got to meet grace for the first time

ausserdem ist es schwer in diesem kaufhaus den berblick zu finden bzw
the carpets took a bit longer than most but i was appreciative for the attention to detail
i feel that they care about our needs and desires
mind you he brought it here for an out of town wedding and when we were at the wedding we had discovered all these stains and hole
i like that
albina does fantastic and fast work for reasonable prices
clearly helping those with disabilities is a cause they support
im not a fan or any of it
as part of the high pressure tactics i was told that the standard cleaning would leave the area smelling like pneumonia
their knowledge and craftsmanship is second to none
first off im that guy that is pleased with all of my apple products so much that i tend to convert straight up strangers to mac and better their lives by saying goodbye to their androids and pcs
after calling and being on hold for an hour they disconnected me i called back and talked to billing who answered after 10 min transferred me back to cancellation department and after 20 min on hold they hung up on me again
they even let us borrow the fan over a weekend
i am out and will never ever do business there again
they kept telling me they could do what i wanted and then doing whatever they wanted instead
i took my phone in but had problems locating the store
they did not question or challenge me on one step in the process
they were very professional
i paid half of my balance of 104052 paid 52026 cash on 53116
at 217 today he called  left a message saying that he was going to be on his way shortly
thanks staples for saving me time and money
id consider giving them another chance the next time i have a technology issue
within an hour george came to my job programed my key phob and cut me a spare key at the rate he quoted me over the phone
carpets and upholstery he does it all
i printed one of each to proof them before printing more
he came the same day we called  about our washer and was finished in under an hour
i found sonnys on google and decided to give them a shot
they really do take pride in what they do
theyre interested in creating a community and a stronger cycling family in charlotte
his wife kathy is also very nice
their work is top notch
he calls his boss and we speak  the owner lowers his price to roughly 220 and says that this new price will include an acid cleaning sealant and they will come back in a year and clean my floors again free of charge
i dreaded the process as i thought it was going to be stressful and difficult
i appreciated their honesty and kindness so much i ended up buying a bike for my partner
i will update how well they do
the older gentleman and i use that term loosely was downright rude and not helpful in answering routine questions
long story short i brought a cracked but usable 6s into mac masters and paid 200
the gateway y has about 30 treadmills 15 bikes and 10 other cardio machines all stationed in front of tvs
very happy day
mike let us know he could do the repair but for my ipad air gen 1 though he only had a black screen replacement
flash forward to 3 months after i got the awesomelooking highquality business cards i today unfortunately discovered a typo
i originally used isleys to replace my ac unit
lulu worked until it fit as it should
but this place deserves it
he and his helper were very polite and careful when moving the furniture
i will keep my fingers crossed that they get another one in soon
i had to printcopy some handouts for a project all my other options were exhausted so i came here
they made a prototype i approved and picked it up
for some reason today instead of getting the usual price for my uniform pants that i always bring in for tailoring
i arranged for a home visit and he was right on time and that is usually rare with home services
not so with royal i always feel so welcome when i see lisas smile and hear her pleasant friendly greeting
i had my stuff here for over a year
ive never experienced it
they did it quickly without touching our house
youd think that because its the y faith values etc
quoted me a very fair price and that it would be ready in a few days
last of all i love the structure and motivation approach
do not use this service
however the vintage one had the dreaded we are sorry but label attached to it
their price was great and they delivered what they promised
there is a sign out now to point you in the right direction so much easier to find
start to finish very professional and very reasonably priced
he came to my restaurant and checked everything out
for example they have boneless beef short ribs does that even qualify to be ribs anymore
if my washer isnt fixed by next week i wont mind having to come back
he loved the teachers and activities
ive been going here off and on since they opened
the companys pricing is also great
boy am i glad i did
he says oh the name is similar
all the reviewers were right
great service great communication great price
check out her store
with a little tweek here and a tweek there my voice was heard and the earphone mode no longer existed
shattered my iphone last night and needed it repaired fast
the drinks were reasonably priced at about 275 or somewhere in that range
not suitable at all
thank you and thank you carepro
i am a fan of grape leaves with meat and they were good
we have our appliance repair company for the future
if youre looking for average smithing and high priced low grade firearms go here
the contract states they have up to 21 business days to arrange delivery
they are all very friendly and extremely helpful
do not go with this company under any circumstance
the quality is great and the clothes come out impeccable every time
i highly recommend him
please dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if youre connected in any way to the owner or employees
we have done several moves with various companies and i would hands down use zippyshell for my next move
its unfortunate cause i loved getting carwash there every single day and having breakfast and lunch with your discounted price for uber drivers
i highly recommend this bike place to people in the champaignurbana area
red tagged items are the higher endbrand name merchandise
when did gas stations go highend
weve used bulwark before and when we moved to another state we chose to use them again
one of the two movers was the same person who had moved me three years prior
i expected to pay much more
swenson can be a very busy street and it is easy to get stuck while trying to exit the parking lot
clothes look great
when i asked about forwarding  mail i was told mail cant be forwarded from a po box which is fine so i asked if that is the case please return any mail to the postman i was then firmly told they would hold all mail for 6 months and if i wanted to get it i would have to pay for 6 more months for the po box my mail will be held hostage unless i pay almost 200 seems like it should be mail theft the worst of it was the attitude of the owner who pretty much told me if i dont like it then pay the hostage charge  buyer beware
ill make to tell everyone at the post office
these guys went above and beyond the call of duty
mixed experiences at the apple store whenever i pop in to visit although most of my disappointment comes from the seemingly lacking or always outofstock peripheral or accessory i am looking for at the moment
they have such a creative and diverse selection of gifts that are very competitively priced
i tried both the pod and the open concept room
people like this i no longer thought existed in a time where the economy is fragile but let me assure you if im gonna drive almost 300 miles im going to tell my truth when reviewing
the impact of their efforts was immediate
my mom walked out with a cute bracelet that she wanted to add to her arm candy
it is a cream color coat and it really wasnt dirty but the very edges of the sleeves when i checked it out when i was to wear it the sleeves were still dirty
i asked to be let out of my contract after paying for another quarter in june and was told that no one could make that decision because the owner was on a fishing trip and wouldnt be back until monday
there were a lot of people there but the wait wasnt long for anything at all
in spite of all the awesomeness oddly the gift shop seems to have been an afterthought
first of all tmi
very prompt with responses and helpful with my team getting us the right products
overall place was good
we noticed a couple of termite trails hanging from our bedroom ceiling
the girls dress was ruined
i guess that since they are a small company with a couple of large accounts little guys like me are insignificant
i had someone lined up for tint and he flaked out so i looked on yelp to find a place and saw that this place has great reviews
he made some recommendations on what to use to keep it working properly and billed us only the diagnostic fee
the gold and crimson architectural details were exquisite and the ceiling decorationsbeautiful
i find that extremely hard to believe considering you have to start somewhere
these bins are filled with dust and debris of broken items and just what you usually find when you are cleaning out a drawer you have been putting things in for more than a decade
it was heavier than expected  so it cost me a little more 175 total  that includes 40 for the extra weight but i was happy to spend it
discovered bb pools last year and they helped rebuild and reinstall my pool pump  even gave it a nice fresh coat of paint too
the guest bathroom tub was still dirty
i am absolutely sure that my ac is working more efficiently now
my wife and i were spending some time in phoenix to resupply before entering mexico on a long bicycle tour

to avoid potential disasters we generally hire contractors based on word of mouth and a friend had recommended monster plowing to take care of the snow work
we informed them we had left the school and were told numerous times by numerous staff members including the stand in director that no forms needed to be filed upon leaving
the only people there were getting help like me or learning aperture or how to check their emails or something
this is our third experience wit1h ifix
cutlers was at my house by 11am on saturday which was earlier than my scheduled time

i absolutely love this place
he called them and we had an appointment scheduled for later in the afternoon today
determined the dishwasher was actually not the problem it was the new garbage disposal that had been installed incorrectly by someone else
i set an appointment up with justin that worked with my schedule
however none of the other items were taken care of
i contacted another wellrecommended company first and got a earful of how great that guys company was
i found the staff very friendly and helpful
josh is the nicest  most patient apple technician
when i expressed surprise at the quick turnaround the driver did admit that they launder the wedding dresses about once a month and i was just lucky to have arranged for my dress cleaning right before that scheduled date
that did not turn out
the young lady seemed miffed that we were going to walk out after she let us sit on a bike  but that was it
i read the reviews for legacy and was pleased with the stars and the responses from the management

i cant say enough about how pleased we were with everything
i nicely explained that i wasnt there for a counseling session
i dropped of a beloved 14 year old pair of  boots to be resoled
letting him know that he could remove the old hot from the back yard the next time he was in the area
justin came out was friendly and removed every stain
needless to say i sent him on his way  will never call this company again
got me scheduled for a time i wanted worked fast no mess or fuss and the price was fantastic
its always crappy when your phone breaks but great to know theres someone who can make it like it never happened
although pricing was a bit high i realize this cannot be avoided in such an area of the gta

i called and left several more messages but never heard back
thank you again crpc
they have done everything for me from simple hemming reconstructing 400 dresses to fit properly replaced zippers patched up my boyfriends 300 jeans multiple times etc
thank you chase
ben was patient with me and even suggested if the truck is at a loss they will wait for a tow truck to come pick it back up
then i also posed the question as to why my sprint hotspot gets interrupted when i was told by the salesman all calls and text would be blocked
cant wait to come back and pick up my dress and see you again
he stitched and reinforced with glue all the loose parts of the shoe right on the spot at a very reasonable price
plain and simple this place is wonderful
they quickly installed our water softener with no complications
in another incident the teacher pulled a child from a group with a learning disabled child by telling her it wasnt fair to be stuck with her
and i know it isnt me because it has happened over 5 times now
i called at 8 am and spoke with justin
anytime i need anything the school helps me out with it they are very understanding
tell me that my package will be delivered on monday
and the average shoe size is an 8 i just thought it was ridiculous for her to make this comment to a customer
fun fun fun for the whole family
did the staff say anything
if i could rate them a negative number i would

unless they jumped my sixfoot fence and got pass my dogs thats impossible
my dealings with pos over a bunch of years fall into 2 categories  very positive or very negative
to begin it took me 6 calls asking them to send me my contract of which i received then night before the move
every one you need to talk to to resolve an issue is either not in today no longer works there or  theres no need in contacting cause they are an independent store

sometimes im in there for hours washing clothes

a supervisor even came by to make sure everything was done correctly
the first day pictures i received truly got me through the day and each day she comes home so excited to tell me about what she has learned
jessica the supervisor said believe me he hasnt been crying for that long but we only left him for 4 hours and his voice was gone when i got there and his eyes were so red

their service is fast but maybe too fast as at least twice a month i get shirts back with my collar buttons ripped out of the shirt leaving a sizable hole that makes it difficult to replace the button in the same spot

dont ever use this company
the place is a good size bright and clean

they recycle the wood and if you want something to remember the tree they can make something out of it
a perpetual smile on his face he answered all my anxious questions intelligently and no bs
a lot of my work clothes are dry clean only and this place is very good
they did this promptly while i waited at an extremely competitive price
they called with a very reasonable estimate and voila my treasured vacuum was in my possession exactly a week later working like new

the gentleman who helped me was knowledgable and friendly
all of these pros plus easy parkingyou have nothing to lose
within the last 6 months the entire store has gone under management changes with new fully trained staff they are always very helpful and spend time trying to help me with my options
in addition the team takes pride in their work and the facility is clean safe and stocked for your moving needs
mechanics are some of the best out there and the service will make you feel like youve known them your whole life
needed a tire on my 35 year old peugeot and these guys found the right tire at a competitive price and dropped what they were doing to get me back on the road
i normally print postage at home and then have them pick it up but there are sometimes i need things to get moving right away
i was really satisfied
these guys are great and much more reasonably priced than many of the other more wellknown carpet cleaning services
for shoes some parts and accessoriesthey are still ok if you have bike saavy and are looking for something specific that is not trek you might want to look elsewhere

i havent check around to compare prices but the price that i pay always seems fair
i believe in giving back to the community by patronizing local businesses
i received a call about 445 today 1218 from steve stating him and james were 10 minutes awayand that they were
i call customer service and it turns out the driver was never paged the gate code
he said i would be better off filing on my own instead of paying him but if i went ahead and paid the consultation fee he would look at my paperwork before i sent it off
however the only reason i didnt give it five stars was because the people working at the counter seemed slower than at other locations
it might be one of the only places to go in there area but ill be seeking goods elsewhere from this point forward
we did not have one hour make the repairs
i guess the tech had stopped by
i explained that it took me that long because i was trying to figure out the problem

they worked efficiently and did not waste any time
the cleaning itself was exceptional
it fit approximately 30 of my guests
our only drawback to the place is the turnover in management

my husband and i shopped around a lot for my engagement ring before going to the jewelry exchange
no complaints did what i asked at a reasonable price in a fair amount of time
lots of people were coming in and out actually picking up laundry that they left to the laundry matt to have done for them
very professional install and installer explain how the unit works and how to maintain it
lots of hidden fees

i was told there would be a 99 emergency service fee
our technician mario called around 10 minutes till 2pm and asked if it was okay if he could be here in 10 minutes

after some casual conversation and a few bobby pins later i had a price quote date when they would be ready and i was outta there
tv mounts are dead on level even and sturdy with no wires being seen anywhere
its very refreshing to see a company own up to their mistakes and be humble enough to ask for a chance to fix them

they have everything from large items for decorating your home to dishware for your kitchen soap for your bathrooms clothes for yourself and even deliciously adorable antique jewelery
my wife noticed it
his general demeanor and attitude was so condescending that i thought maybe i was being punked and the call was being recorded
this means a lot because i am an educator and it is important that my daughters are in school with teachers who foster the love for learning and make learning fun

about 6 weeks after the end of the service and after i had left they tried to charge me for missing equipment to the tune of about 350
friendly staff and took care of what we needed
driver quoted a price for a half truck load it certainly wasnt on the low end of what is available for hauling at 300 but not outrageous
i hired adams disaster restoration
h3k3 held the tablet in his hand
right around the corner from my house

if this is the new mindset of their employees i might start to believe their yes
if i could giver zero stars i would
the person that showed up was very professional on time and careful
they came out the next day after calling in and gave us a very reasonable quote
this is the worst experience i have ever had
i hate i had to give them 1 star zero is more appropriate
my word against their wordand he believed them
i understand their perspective but i think they setup the wrong expectation from the beginning they shouldve told us the bees will keep returning if they cant get the hive so we couldve contracted someone who could get the hive and they shouldnt have made it seem like they would keep coming back until the job is done because they dont

i havent seen a single scorpion inside or out in 30 days
better than driving to the mall and walking around looking for a kiosk

the attendant was very nice and helpful greeted me with a smile when i came in and has done the same for all her other patrons
i have been pleased
thank you to my fellow yelp reviewers
his coworker had to come to the counter and ask me what i wanted done

i would come 30 miles to see her if i had something to fix
ill definitely go to them for future repairs
turns out that the part he diagnosed as faulty was not broken  shame on us for purchasing the part to repair it ourselves as we wouldnt have trusted him to do it properly
the case manager could not tell me what words we would prioritize and i again had to cross out many of the words since they had to do with places i didnt do business and for hotels in cities i dont even have a business in
well worth the money  time
they didnt even tell me they did it i had to find the damage
he is no shoe expertbut he figured the soles just needed to be glued so he left it up to this business that claims to fix shoes to tend to his needs

the guy was great he gave me several different options which i appreciate

we have done white water rafting
we recently bought a house where we found over 20 scorpions in the yard in two days and saw a cockroach in the driveway
this company is great
they played a big role with my son and his speech
it wasnt until the end of november wedding dec 20 that i decided i should start looking for someone
it was obvious he stood behind his well deserved reputation and wanted me to be happy about using his company
they stopped answering my calls and the owner robin never returned my calls to remedy the situation
i wish i could put into words just how much these two touched me and made a lasting impression with me
after using several companies in town we came across mc cleaners and they won us over

service has been good overall

and he argues like an expert let me tell you beware do not go there have someone come to your home and fix your computer where you are going to use it i promise you this guy is not good he used a pirated copy of word and left the disc in my hard drive and then had the nerve to ask for it back
when i returned to pick up my clothes on 43015 10 days after i dropped off my 4 items that need to be hemmed the woman in the front said that my items were not ready and i should have called because they were busy
i have the sense that there is a pride in the work and it shows
the fact that this wasnt conveyed to me shows a major lack of communication between the associate and me or even from the associate to the tester
this is my 2nd house using responsible pest control and as impressed with this company as i have been with a new tech
he went thru our neighborhood and was on his way out going in the opposite direction when he asked my son
our little baby boy really seems to like it a lot because he smiles and seems to always be looking at our awesome teacher miss nicole

jackets blazers pants jeans long sleeved shirts adds suspender buttons to your pants all of it
they claim to have same day service on dry cleaning if there in by 11am suppose to be done by 5pm

the day i received my phone my led screen changes to a white haze and faded color and the tempered glass has a starburst pattern crack in it already
giovanni did a fantastic job recovering my husbands recliner

this is my second review of this store and i have to say it was just as bad the second time as it was the first

i purchased a cannondale quick carbon 1 the tech was also great with pointers and recommendations
at that time of night i was happy to have it

the suite is by far the best fitted and liking that i have
the basic insurance covers only 060 a pound so after haggling day after day with the company for 1 year and the insurance company they use i finally was rewarded with only 114 for my ruined desk
its about you trying to up the price deceitfully
i called my home owners warranty company to ask them to send someone over
i send all of my clients to cesar for his services with dmv  its an added value to my insurance agency and he gives them a discounted rate
made sure i was knowledgeable about the problem and the solution and included me every step of the way
i appreciated that the products used were not harmful or as toxic as other cleaning companies products
why cant other places have service as good as this

but that stuff is gone the second its placed on the sales floor

the ladies whenever there is someone there are nice if theyre not on their cell phones talking away then a couple of weeks ago i went in for the last time as i finally moved out of that area thank goodness now im trying to call their customer service number and all you get is a damn answering machine saying theyll call back in 24 hrs
i have now used them to move out of house and into a condominium complex as well as most recently trusting them to get my belongings from phoenix az to san francisco ca
they are crooks
now my phone is working great but the process to get here was less than smooth
im pretty sure they arent supposed to close until 400 taking business elsewhere
they are craftsmen and a gem in a central convenient location
not only did you take on such huge task but you took on that mom and friend role that i didnt have i will forever have such a great memory building my dream dress with such a wonderful lady
i found their prices to be reasonable especially considering the excellent service we received
usually quick service even with a line of customers with odd requests
very professional and friendly
he was very thoughtful in his process
and how to get rid of them
in addition to this they never showed up the first time we scheduled an appointment
he is very knowledgeable and takes the time to listen to your concerns and finds a way to take care of anything that is troubling you
i recommend coming here if your in the area
they did window tint for 3 cars of mine and all is perfect
either business must be really good or this company is extremely unprofessional
i highly recommend it
i didnt think anything of it when i let this man go into my room unattended but now i realize that a bag of change with a lot of money in it is gone
he showed up on time and was super fast
i call them back when i got home and told them that im not going back to there place anymore and said that they can give my discount the next day in cash
we never received a shipment confirmation from the company with band starting soon i contacted the company to find out where our order was
parma state of mind yall
the customer service is appalling
i immediately called home warranty company
visited the business during its stated opening hours and it was closed when i got there
if you ever get into a lusty bedroom brawl and he destroys your leather hand bag ends up in shreds have no fear gary at green valley shoe will make it as good as new
bad customer service
it was only after obtaining legal assistance that prestige cleaners agreed to recompense me for the incurred damages
everyone is friendly and professional
when i asked if they would use the stairs i was told that it couldnt fit because there is a celling at the entrance only a foot taller than the couch
the husband and wife team that own starmount cleaners work six days a week and they have not yet invested in a computerized order taking system
i wont go back
these dresses are knee length not ball gowns
she has always completed my tax forms swiftly and efficiently as a knowledgeable professional
they are particularly good for guys like me who play the old 80sstyle metal guitars  they actually know how to properly set up locking tremolos
then the next day him and his team member came and removed the old material and mold and contained the area he was honest and great
better quality than the model by a long shot
she is extremely knowledgeable and could give us all kinds of info on the various bikes i was looking at
my only beef albeit very slight is that they dont take cards theyre cash
there is also a recreation centre open for the youth for after school hang out and chilling place equipped with tvs couches pool table the aim is to keep the kids out of trouble
i will go back if need be
turns out my problem was only a circuit board
it costs 25 to open the door
i told him that this is not a good business practice and asked when will the owner return
new owner moved in on tuesday
i got hit by a car and had to drag the bike that i  bought from them to the store to get repaired well the kid that helped me was just  a prick in my tubes
thank you so much silverstate
i will definitely use this company again as well as recommended it to friends
inside the barber shop on university dr right across from genos restaurant
and he was very easy to talk to and he did an excellent job for us he cleaned thoroughly and he really brought our carpet back to life
my roommate used this company to move cross country
i made this account specifically to write this review because i am very pleased with the service i received
the address for the processing agent is a po box number 218 at 1966 tice valley blvd in walnut creek ca
i spent over 18000 and i know many fellow students spent much less
i just wasted 90  what a rip off
everything worked out without a hitch
no its more like if optimus prime ate a hobby lobby and gave birth to hightech maker machine puppies
this review is for the great friendly service not so much for the quality of the tuneup
i go get in the line shes attending to  she goes off  does something else ignoring me the whole time
good luck to everyone searching
the service with these ladies is unmatched at any business i frequent
yet here is where i say its just ok and not lower or higher i was watching every employee and thats due to my background but no one was literally smiling or at least trying to show they cared there were two employees who didnt even acknowledge me when i said hello or hi they just glanced over so to me i am guessing working for cox is just another job for some lol
i often travel further just to come here to get some things done because i wouldnt trust anyone else with my clothes
i promptly emailed the paperwork and sent a followup email to confirm that it was received
they were great and very helpful with the whole experience
as he took some from the back of the line and some from in front of us we eventually moved to be second in line
getting a repair done here was a bad experience
just moved to east valley
our guide on the day was jeff who was funny informative and made the day enjoyable for the whole group
the looked the home over and said they could have it all done in about two hours
my vacuum had a significant problem and it was still under warranty larry at the arboretum location went above and beyond to get me the best replacement
i found them via yelp talk and opted to get it repaired rather than purchasing a new one
operators that dont listen speak from their own script and pay no attention to your question
forward nevada is amazing
this company is totally awesome
diamondbacks have only 21 or fewer speeds
i contacted them on a friday and the wash was ready to be delivered on saturday
the idiots delivered 23 of a fridge while they kept all of our money
this was my first time using there services and i will continue to do so
it is amazing how quick and easy it was for him to do
they made me feel welcome as a customer
i had a simple stove repair
of course given the downtown location youll have to walk or subway your goods home unless you want to be the costly downtown parking fees
serena gave me tips on how to sit and to keep the dress pulled down bc of its weight
so far i have yet to find one and would love to hear about one that can actually service and repair solar systems
great company bryan and his team stands behind their  work
i have bought really lovely hardwood childrens toys in perfect condition
they are always very professional and have the best small touches to the end of their clean
furthermore they read out the last 4 digits of your phone number now so you have no way of knowing where you are in line
but the moment i walked into this jewelry store daniel treated us with such respect this is a family owned jewelry shop where all the family members work you will receive top quality customer service and he will do anything to help you find what youre looking for
had a pleasant business encounter with one shot installation yesterday 122
big mistake same issue carpet did not appear clean and was really stiff
the clerks seemed to notice because i was very pleasant with them
she said no called someone speaking spanish  then told me to call police pointed to the sign saying not responsible
keep in mind they are very busy because they are awesomeso sometimes the scheduling is tight
he was professional and was obviously very experienced in the trade
thanks liz  and a special thank you to you cj  you rock
buckle in this is bound to be long winded
not to mention shes located close to asu so its great for students like me to get any thing done they need to their clothes
i used to be smart
his price was great and he had great reviews
on monday when i called again they stated they would send someone out again for an additional charge
not only were ian seth and markeith super positive and friendly but were so thorough in the way they wrapped all of our furniture as well as being so careful
for our surprise the expert was available and he arrived short after our phone call
its a gorgeous ring and im proud to wear it
they were offering a 5 discount with a donation of a nonperishable food item but i think thats for the holiday season
simple and to the point business
one instance especially was relevant as i was under a time crunch and an employee stayed late to help me get what i need
i dont know if she was overwhelmed didnt want to be there just didnt care or what but she was not pleasant or happy at all and did not know the menu either nor did she care to find out
summary excellent customer service technician manny was awesome parts price somewhat excessive
the prices been quoted were outrageous
the problem with the heater was not repaired and most importantly ac is not working now
i never thought i was capable of doing that
i do not go out so that someone can nuke my dinner
our son have been attending merryhill since last year
just sick about the whole thing
i have always been treated very well
the service tech mike was very nice fast and super clean

i like the vibe here and the folks are super cool

all i can say is that hes got the magic touch to getting rid of those nasty computer viruses fred did an amazing job

we called for a quote for removal of a soft water system and got fully educated on the system
to which he responded wait for it by telling the movers to walk away from the job
i asked to speak to the supervisor and he said he was the supervisor

we have been with dr death for about 2 years now and we love the service
the outcome was not a specifically good one since the part was not of quality
a surprising number smile and say already have
he sprayed the interior and exterior and gave us a 3month guarantee on his service
wonderful experience  annette was very helpful  she is very pleasant knows her stuff
the crew was on time considerate and professional
ultimately she helped me create what i hope is a perfect solution
that was exhausting
and everyone seemed genuinely nice  a rarity at a place like that
we have had everything from scorpions to ants in and outside of the house
so hesitantly take the review off and then he responds saying to keep the bad review since yelp will not let me update it again
you might get lucky and be assigned an ok cleaner
horrible experience all around
also bought a great vintage receiver
to pay a 20 drying fee one would expect the job to be done right the first time

i would highly recommend them
i also had a couple dead struts from a van that i wanted to recycle  theyll happily take that stuff off your hands though i dont believe they weigh enough to warrant payment
dont ever use this company
he refused to take a maintenance request
there is a real uhaul down the street they cost a little bit more but probably are worth the extra cost
if i could give more than 5 stars i would gladly do so
no breaks and no stops for conversation
colburn enterprises has been fantastic helping with plumbing jobs both at our home and also our small rental property
he said what do you want me to do lady and i said come on time

they sold us this insurance and then when we filed the claim for all the stuff that was stolen they said because they didnt pack it they werent responsible for missing and broken items because it wasnt listed on the paperwork as damaged and we signed the paperwork
update on my not so happy post
velofix sends out an estimate of the parts and labor to you before the appointment so you are not surprised by the repair bill when its all done

it looked wonderful and was not tight any longer
i was recently in a rush to get my bike fixed for a weekend so i went by here on my lunch break

and these were reasonably priced
i called for service over a week ago about my pool pump leaking and not priming

whats the point of just making bikes just sit at a shop proving their dedication to being fixed for days on end when they could be outside being bikes

they are very reasonable compared to other companies
we bought a day pass and tried to fit as much in as we could but unfortunately the trip was cut short by a lightening storm

i assume that amazon estimate of delivery will have 23 days for ontrac idiocy added onto it

long story short
family owned company
he drilled a couple holes in the stucco garage wall  and exterminated the bees
the movers were quick and organized
not good enough in my book
or so i thought after inspecting the carpet i was quoted 180
i thanked him for his follow up  that i personally think was only because of my yelp review
their prices were outrageous though
she insisted that it was mine
yes their prices are shockingly high for a lot of stuff and the internet is way better to buy electronics but the service here was really nice and helpful and i appreciated it
lauren was super nice and understood our concern but had no control over how we could get our stuff sooner
living in phoenix during the summer months it gets hot
the istore customer service is the best of all the local stores that are locally and owned by the corporation
we called to figure out what was going on and after 30 minutes on the phone explaining we didnt want these services or a professional install and were upset because the bundle was not cheaper and not what we wanted in the first place she was finally able to take us back to our original plan
i was fairly offended that i had just been called a liar
this also meant no air conditioning in the summer and really cold in the winter
he also hauled away the older one so i didnt have to deal with disposing it
i bring all our martial arts clothing here
service man arrived early surprise
bought the kit and have been happy with it since of course everything gets upgraded went back in february to buy an acoustic kit
i wanted to remind them they were paid for 3 hours but i figured i didnt want them in my home if they didnt want to be here
most of the time it felt as if i was doing the gc job and just paying him in name only
got a chance to say hi to the owner annie and she was nothing short of rude and condescending
the whole desperate people selling gold and only dealing in cash made me think that this guys operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings
instead of leaving them at the door in the heat he called me so i could get someone to accept delivery
assures me theyll be taken care of promises i wont be charged for the keys
most recent delivery is 4 days past scheduled delivery date 250 miles away and been rescheduled for delivery twice
i had previously been to a staples up the street but unfortunately they didnt have what i wanted in stock
shes my tailorseamstress from now on
i guess i forgot
which he said he didnt know what we were doing i told him common sense would say if we were at the back doors we were obviously trying to get something or someone out and that he could have easily driven around to park in the spot he parked in instead of being lazy and just pulling through
i trusted these women and they unfortunately proved to me that i should not have
i have been going here for a couple of years
totally worth it because i love the finished product
know what youre capable of
praising that they had to drive to the location because the driver never delivered even though they received an email with a window the driver ignores
their go out of their way to help and try and find the best most economical option for the customer
we had them replace a broken ipad screen and it was done in under a couple of hours for a fraction of the price of other stores in the area
i dont know if he had previously given us some kind of special deal for all those years but my services were twice as much this time around
this is the second time that ive dealt with these guys and they are great to work with
it wouldve taken me 2 days to do what they did in 25 hours
saturday i call back the person i spoke to on the phone tells me to call another number  the guy who orders the parts and speak to him directly
bookmark this company
because youre incompetent
so whats my beef
smell great too
i opted for the groupon for cleaning and sealing of up to 700 feet of tile
the culligan repairman told me the ro holding tank was damaged and needed replacement
a designer friend recommended this company to me and i knew it had to be good because hes even more last minute than i am when it comes to everything
there is a waiting list for this school so i recommend applying a couple months in advance
weve had only the tiniest spiders around the pool and some visiting bees and wasps
we love that they send pictures throughout the day and a daily report of what the kids did and ate during the day
we will be dropping off another sofa soon
he was short with me and plain out rude
i know i tried to purchase a unicorn design set of gloves
andrea made sure to ask if this was ok and if she had any allergies ahead of time
went back again that day and was told it was because of the fan
we tested to make sure it was working fully and then as he was putting it all back together i said that i expected some kind of discount for the inconvenience of coming all the way back down for something that they had done to my computer
worst delivery service ive ever used
greeter says hi and ask how she can help
i had some trouble with ordering returning and reordering spanning purchases made online and in the storethe staff was patient and helpful with me
i got the sense that they were experiencing financial difficulties or employee turn over issues
he proceeded to answer about 6 phone calls while i waited and waited
they cleaned the  tile in our small business and did an amazing job
lulu worked on my bridesmaids dress
ok so how much is that part
again he provided the best service
not bad in my book but still apprehensive25 and up to resize depending on size and the ring and she said come on in and theyd be happy to help
product was nice
seriously hope i dont need a moving co for a while ha but if i do will use again
i think the guy working behind the counter could tell that i was a little confused when i came in for a look
surprised they are still in business
weve seen results we just werent seeing with the big name pest control company
the team is all exceptional and very helpful
ashley is not only a great instructor but a shining ray of light when she challenges the bodies that join her for a hatha flowy outdoor class
i found them on yelp and really liked them
im pretty sure they only cleaned it with water
which we never found the copy
there can be a slight language barrier but only if you let it happen
courteous and quick
should have used a different company
lines were fast staff were mostly polite unless they were stockers who were stoic bordering on rude probably to prevent requestsinquiries
so i called the national number a second time
i give them the highest recommendation
the phone was untouched by them
i had a bad experience with the assistant and the managerowner they were very root talking to me
waste of time and gas
i received a detailing by in the detail as a gift and couldnt be happier
they need to be more responsive to errors on their end
but i needed business cards and saw one of several signs outside that read 18 business cards so i turned around and went back and went inside
he was able to arrive at my house only 90 minutes after i called
they get 2 stars only for the large selection
i have ordered 30mil plastic cards from dgi for several years and have been very impressed with the quality and service
he was kind courteous professional and very thorough
overalll very happy with the service and education
four weeks had passed since i had dropped off my shoes
apparently that was asking for too much and apparently to dykmans grownups dont wear colorful wristbands
i had talked to the clerk about ordering me a used battery since my car is a lease and the lease is almost up
above average in many ways no big weaknesses
pros perfect service no lines neighborhood feel cons i just wish they were open on sunday
contacted mike through yelp and he replied in minutes
agent says wow you have been a customer for 12 years
without fail the employee takes them to the most expensive option in the store and sometimes makes pretty poor product recommendations
had to return one pair because of a sloppy job on one heel he fixed it no charge but still looks bad
so glad i  found this shop
the only one we could find locally was mr pool  mrs patio and they wanted 2300 so we kept putting it off
allen is genuinely sympathetic and makes this heartwrenching task as bearable as possible
got new wheel and staff change over gears and tire in 15 minute
what an absolute disgrace
friendly professional prompt correspondence
we called the store twice only to wait 45 minutes on hold
what a mistake
the people and the location make the place
my experience with elegant gifts az was incredibly positive because they truly care about their customers and ensure they receive the utmost positive experience
i think by a little over 50 per week more but the piece of mind that my son felt comfortable and the care that the teachers seem to give makes up for it
i called before hand on monday to see if i could have a dress hemmed by friday
the manager was very apologetic but we had to leave it and make an additional round trip from boulder city
we had looked for the right piece for months that fit into our budget
they were very courteous professional and did a great job cleaning upi would highly recommend them to anyone in the future
two months people
all for only 14 which i think is quite reasonable
he then packed up his equipment and left
in the mean time evan tried to win back our business by offering our next five shipments for free
i would highly recommend them for kids birthday party
1500 for what
they are very rude and mean
i told them about the 50 quotes i got and after some back and forth we settled at the midpoint of 60
i had a great experience with a to z valley wide movers this past weekend
i took my ipad directly to the apple store to find out that apple will not repair a device that has been opened by a vendor like iphixation
i called several places to have my leather coat dyed
when it was returned to me the foam cups in the bust where all mangled
meine mutter wollte dort ihren staubsauger reparieren lassen weil er sich nicht mehr einschalten liess
it was like eating tofu in flavored water
very professional movers
the property manager asst
sissy at legacy funeral home in chandler was a lifesaver at our moment of grief
these guys are amazing
update i originally gave sprint a good review and boy am i eating my words
he was behind the counter but not helping
if your looking for a place to get your stuff dry cleaned or washed  pressed look no further
chuck was there when i arrived and spent a while chatting to me about the issue and all the cases that he had seen of this nature
id simply recommend checking this place out whether your nearby or not so nearby this place is a great addition to the charlotte area
every person i called said it was impossible and that the shed would fall into the pool
this is the only place in phoenix i will trust to come into my home
poor moving boxes were damaged thrown around my dining room table damaged dropped on a corner and most importantly boxes were lost with important items pls do not pack anything of value
they made my terrible day so much better
no ac so hot  they have fans but still very hot in summer
i stepped out of the long line glad there was another avenue to get my transaction done quickly
thanks tim and gustavo
worst worst worsti went to repair phone shop and fixed my iphone
he proceeded to take the pins out very quickly and hand the shorts back to me with a huge attitude
they also drove off quickly with not a care that i was upset  not a care at all
very quick nice and informative
glad i took that chance of coming here one more time just to see that it has changed
standing at the door was jeff the owner with my shirts in his hand
called the office they said they made a note and would have the tech call me to set the appt
paid their tech 45 to come out  diagnose prob w dishwasher in  early  nov  we were advised that they needed to order special part which would be available for instillation in 23 wks
compared to any other place ive used  their pricing has to be the most reasonable and definitely the best bang for your buck
they have no solution and are not sure it can be fixed
i would definitely recommend this tour to anyone going to the vegas area
i think when it comes to asking a tailor how much it costs to alter a jacket its kind of like asking a doctor how much its going to cost to treat your cough
also buy the yelp deal to save a few bucks
they are the best of the best when it comes to clean carpets
awesome experience every time
our employees love the selection the fresh food the ability to request items and the variety of options
this is just the worst
took it all apart and put a few new pieces in it
sorry to be so late with my review
daniel the owner of kids fun town organized everything perfectly and the whole party was easy and relaxing a first for a childrens party
i know nothing about fingerprinting i assumed they did
called these guys and they did not dissappoint
he didnt like the progess but i thought it looked nice
everyone is always so friendly im glad i made the switch from walgreens
all the rooms were done thoroughly and even the closets looked good
if i really had the time to put every single tech and rep i have spoken to through you guys i will
i was told i would get a quote the next day
she was helpful in that she reminded me that i needed to keep up with my receipt because there was no other way to prove that i dropped off the package
the work was exquisite and the service exemplary
i would recommend image mart for any of your printing needs
i couldnt be happier with the fit of my wedding dress and the outstanding and humble service i received
oh well back to south east asia where they are service oriented and appreciate any customer business
they have a heated indoor pool with swimming lanes for adults and a great track and athletic field out front
warning  i do not recommend this place
he not only did not want to hear my explanation he kept talking on top of me
yes their prices are higher and if you have any clue about shipping whatsoever you will know this already
i was extremely happy with the customer service and will bring all my broken apple products to them in the future
i have recommended this place to everyone and im sure that i found the best in the business
do not take your child here i used to work here and in the 5 months i saw 7 people leave
i was greeted at the door and promptly directed to the accurate destination
i have been coming here since my first was little at least 10 years
i then reiterate that the guy is technically a day and a half late and he in turn tries to sell me tv service
long version  if i could would give this store zero stars i would
i went down to the post office right after i checked my box i get off work at 4 by the time i got my box checked it was 415430
i just witnessed the worst move ever
all of the rugs still had the companys tags on  a white one stating clean and one yellow one stating mothproof in handwriting
id go back to west towne but not before troubleshooting with apple over the phone
what i love was the ease of booking the appointment having it easily available to book is a plus
go check them out
i only used 1 of the 2 hours the groupon included so it would have been nice to get reimbursed or additional services for that extra hourbut overall the guys were great  friendly too
people love this place
otherwise it would be one star
he was very helpful to my situation
i hope the owner of the establishment reads this and fires the staff who clearly dont care about his business
but today when i went it was a comedy of errors a frontloader was leaking bucket loads of water 98 of the dryers were in use at the same time these punks were playing hacky sac next to me and this guy with shockingly hairy arms spent 8 minutes organizing his white plastic hangers
curtis was very knowledgeable and professional
i have never had my carpets cleaned before so i wasnt sure what to expect but it was totally worth it and i would recommend this company to anyone
the other day i found three items that had been cleaned by them but i had not worn since last summer
maybe in the future they will change their hours from 95 to 106 this would help out a lot with many peoples schedules
which i would recommend especially if your just vacationing
i also found out there is a bed count
wednesday morning arrives and kevin gives me a call letting me know he is at the location furniture store picking up the items
i regret writing down a list of things i really wanted accomplished within the 5 whole hours we were scheduled for because she seemed to just stick to my broad list
i have been asked if i live on it before
asking questions got them frowning at me like i did something wrong
my black and white crochet overlay dress turned out great too this was first time having this item cleaned i was concerned if the chemicals could make the black dye bleed into the white
we did so much research and toured different schools
ive been shopping at a number of gc stores ca nv ny for years
thanks for being so helpful
george was very reasonably priced less expensive than the groupon company i had paid for extra deep cleaning helped me move furniture and didnt try to oversell upselletc
they told me they would have it redone in an hour
when we tried to explain that there was no school she would start balling and all we could do was laugh  thank you hands in hands for all you do for our children
he had me text him a photo of the dryers manufacturing info so smart to be sure he knew what he might need to bring
and it looks brand freaking new beautiful
good selection foreign  domestic
if you not a personal friend or family member of the owners of this business then stay away
and their prices arent bad either but certain items you may be able to get cheaper at target or somewhere else along those lines
then he said that the reason he called was because amazoncom said i can pick it up
everything from setting up the appointment to get an estimate to the day before and the day of went smoothly
fix the problem
i love the speed of service
not a bad store location
le personnel connait bien leurs produits et rponde aisment  nos questions
i could however see evidence of water in it
it was very unsettling for me to put my kids in day care at the thought id be leaving my precious fragile lives in the hands of strangers
we were running late with our move and at 11am i receive a phone call telling me my truck was cancelled
just started my two year old here
honestly i would give zero stars if i could
both the morning and afternoon teachers are very caring and show great interest in our babys well being
luis and his team are professional timely courteous personable and take great pride in their work
i couldnt believe it
will definitely use them again
the biting continued and increased
my rub on this is the condescending indifferent attitude i pick up on from people at apple these days
thank you sabrina
the ladys response when i told her this was that some other person had put their child not toddler but child in the quilt cart just the other day
he made a point to let them know he would take it in another time if they could not get it done in time
ed can be sometimes grouchy because it is easy to get frustrated by the unrealistic expectations of some customers but i understand that
i suggest buying a bike
ive been renting stump grinders here for years
he gave me the best price for my ring
the price couldnt be beat and the customer service was an added bonus
i quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and i tell them this
the carpets were freezing cold when he finished and still soaking wet 24 hours later
when telling her of my experience she hung up on me
i had to send back a textbook i rented
no outsourcing all american made
the carpets looked amazing it was night and day
you can reach sam anytime even before or after hours
my story begins when my first moving company failed to show up one saturday morning
i have been using r and c pest control for many years now and the service that they give  is  like none other
i was not here when they allegedly cleaned 3 rooms
you get what you pay for
all they had stocked was dyson
no matter what time they are open accessible and welllit
the techs were so respectful and helpful they left a great impression and i recommend using them
these guys are amazing
he drilled all around the house and aside from the holes he meant to make didnt do any damage
this store opened in what used to be a walgreens
i just wish it would be open when it says its going to be
i needed a notary and an overnight delivery within a three hour window and sand dollar delivered
it is rather dated on the inside in need of some love
it will take awhile for them to assist you now
bad place dont do business with them
they said there was a change in management and it would be another 710 days
it was gonna cost me more than the shoes themselves
he was quick to find the issue and explained very very clearly what the next steps were
unlike almost every other cleaners in town they clean all of the garments instead of sending them out to be cleaned
i had experience of dropping my 3 yr old here several times utilizing their flex pass
i wasnt given much confidence that it could be fixed
she was the only person who cared and tried to help
so i went out and bought a new cooktop so i could pass the inspection
he does not answer or return our calls
i dropped them off and it only was going to take 4 days for them to be repaired
i hope no one else has this experience and i want to save another bride from heartache
it is also an amazing time to give tribute and help fund breast cancer research
after reading reviews and remembering seeing some commercials and their vehicles around town i decided to call roby electric
i was disappointed with this and let the man know that is not what i was promised from the get go
the morning of he and his partner arrived early
there was a lot of heavy furniture as well as some delicate glassware
eric is great and very easy to work with
if you are a resident or visiting and have one of those crazy nights resulting in a damaged shoepurseluggage then stop drop and roll on over to the shoe lab
i called to find out how much it would cost to replace the jogging stroller tire tubs as they were not holding air and the guy in the phone was condescending and completely rude
it needed parts so i got an email saying to come in and pick the parts up
donna at the front desk is such a doll
its the best price for alterations and dry cleaning and is ready for pick up very quickly
i wanted to print some more with some minor changes new address and telephone number
i was quite clear on what he wanted
he even thought of things i didnt even think about while seeking a new refrigerator
i cant stop staring at my ring
they did arrive a few minutes late but the receptionist called me prior and told me they were running a bit late and asked if that would be okay
they were polished dyed and the new heels were great
beware the fame got this guy and hes all about money
i understand that there is no way to solve a noshow mover when your business model relies on temporarilyemployed college students but i was assured at all steps prior to the move that there would be no issue with completing the move within the schedule time
those items which are acceptable  all washed and dried in the same machines i put my stuff in
as i left allenandy thanked me again and assured me that if i have questions to come back
which was also illegal they cannot record phone calls unless they notify customers first
i will always recommend big valley with hopes that if i ever need them again we get craig
cant beat the excellent service and price
does it sound right
i absolutely have no problem with that when i know that the more were able to make the more were able to feed
akila repaired my shattered iphone 6s screen in a short amount of time at a very reasonable price
this is precisely the kind of moving company of which people should steer clear
paul was absolutely great to work with
oh my goodness where do we begin
prices were extremely fair and i would absolutely without question use them again
the staff here are friendly and quick to help you
the sense is that this guy is on a power trip arrogant condescending power trip maybe a woman thing
i was walking around scottsdale quarter and seen this nice little shop i have dropped my phone about four times now i think its time for another screen protector
they used to know us by name
they process there film in house 2x a week they also sell 35mm and medium format film
i didnt ask the price ahead of time which was my mistake but there was no explaination as to why it would cost more than all of the listed prices
great service great communication great price
i used a credit card that i dont use often so i didnt see the reoccurring charges but eventually rather than calling me about it they sent debt collectors
the service was worth every penny
i promise you will not be disappointed with artistry carpet cleaningthey are that good
this was one of several units i was considering
i was crying a bucket of tears
tried to call to ask about a repair and the mailbox is full and can not receive messages
so i called the manufacturer and asked whats going on because im now suspecting this shop is run by gypsy travelers
walls and furniture were protected and saved from the mildewy moldy funk that was destined for them without servpro to save the day
he then cleaned all the moisture out of the vent and took pictures before and after
the service was thorough
super irritated i waited the week
i had a coat cleaned there that wasnt successfully done raindrop stains on microsuede that werent removed and are now permanently ingrained on the coat since they have been chemically treated by the cleaners hence i am updating my review to reflect that
ups and fedex have never had this problem at my condo
i was refunded my 120
also they left black dolly marks on the stairs of the old place
no thank you
i just love this shop
left comment for owners
i would highly recommend this company
perfection plus what
my son love his teachers
we called for multiple repairs on our refrigerator by the store during the warranty period because we had massive ice buildup in the freezer which was supposedly automatic defrost and warm food in the refrigerator after 3 months they even gave us a new refrigerator
the first time i came i paid 5 and the second pair of heels i brought to him were fixed for free because it would only take a second
i have nothing to say bad about ramin
i cant imagine a worse moving experience
i drove all the way from gilbert and am so glad i did
they lied to amazon that they did deliver it on 2nd day
no one seems to know whats going on
he not only solicited me for additional services outside of the 6000 service call he even solicited for his friend marco the plumber
i dropped my note 3 and cracked the screen bigtime i called around and everyone kept saying 150
cleaned the ducts cleaned up after himself  and explained everything thoroughly
whats great about this place is that they have a complimentary pickup and delivery service and there is no minimum of how many items you need to get cleaned
i guess they are busy enough that they dont  want my business so i will move on to someone else who does
never have i seen a post office that always has a line 30 people deep
biggest ripoff joint ever
stood around in 3 different spots near cash registers  totally ignored
spare yourself the burden of dealing with these rude people and go anywhere else
i trust them totally
they dropped it off at the baggage desk at our hotel on time
ill definitely call blue ribbon again for my next move
when my new phone stopped working today i took it to my retailer who said i had to go to the apple store because it was a software issue
and a true salesperson
brought into vegas vacuum  sewing they plugged the hose into another vacuum and whatever was clogging the hose was sucked out right away
she should be promoted as she represents apple to the ninth degree and her enthusiasm and knowledge are what customers like me look for when visiting the store for help
two rooms for 60 sounded reasonable and fair
i used their services this week during my stay at the aria in vegas
here i found a helpful guide in ramin always patient good at answering my questions and a wide menu of tile choices including some smaller lots at what i thought were very good prices
stuffed full of shirts and good quality clothing not to mention a kick ass vintage section towards the rear of the store the volunteers in here know how to make their displays look magical
i original called and talked to dave and greg got back to me within an hour with a replacement bid
upon leaving the store i was sent away without the box for my phone no charger no instruction manual no ear phones
once i explained to jason we were having custom cabinets built and this was our forever home he understood first line products were not going to work for my choices
although they seemed to have a fairly decent selection of rugs there prices were extremely high for the quality of the rugs in their inventory
he said he would be happy to review the rooms and give a fair price
i have taken her alterations course which really is more like studio time where she talks you through your own personal alteration projects
it was 1200 and i asked if the game had been tested it was
his estimate is always what he charges no hidden fees and he and staff are very friendly and polite
rather than deal with warranty paperwork this woman would rather deceive to get her over inflated payment from the customer
definitely would recommend them and definitely would have them move when and if we do decide to move in the future
the twoman crew they sent were polite respectful and treated my stuff as good as my friends would probably better
kims smiling face greet us every morning with a  good morning name of child
she was very apologetic i found the quality to be worth it
these are the best movers ive ever used
we came in for a last minute print job a pretty big one
i look forward to coming again sometime
38 people from connecticut flew out there for the wedding and all said it was the best wedding they ever attended
showed me what my finished product would look like
not only that but they had great customer service
a wine spot i had them treat went away but the treatment area was lighter than the rest of the carpet  so a small temporary issue became a bigger permanent issue
the pride that peter and gus take in their work is beyond anything i have ever seen
i am downgrading my review because of the cost
all in all this company is shit and cannot be trusted
this one dude carried my couch by himself
the price is the same as office depot or office supply store etc
he made sure i was happy with everything
they called thirty minutes out to give me time to be ready for them
so after a glass of wine i feel about ready to write this review
i chose this company because i was ok with paying more then other companies for better service however i am deeply disappointed with the service i received
they were able to determine the size locate two of them in the shop and had the old ones popped out and the new ones pressed in in about 20 minutes
they dont check the infants enough and seemed to be understaffed
i thought for sure the thing was doomed
there was no damage to walls or floors either
ephone is an offering with a free number unlimited incoming call and available through web or mobile apps
i would recommend him to anyone
i took in a new pair of sandals that my dog had almost chewed through
nothing but positive experiences with this company and would recommend to all my friends and family
with his help and advice i am sure i can do it myself with no problem
we highly recommend them to any prospective customer
it doesnt take much of my kids time but it is an everyday program
highquality pro photo printer at back of store for large professional projects
i noticed a lot of variation in the quality of service among the apple stores and some would go out of their way to help you while some would go out of their way to prevent you from getting help
the employee took it right in and got it out he also taught me how to take the canister apart so i could clean it
search for covenant child care center they have a lot more reviews tagsnotes from past students and families
both are grappling sports similar to wrestling except your opponent is allowed to grab your clothing your gi and use it to throw you offbalance you and submit you
i have never had a problem with this place staff i have dealt with have all been pleasant until my experience with this guy
i then called peggy back to inform her about the black spots on the dress she proceeded to raise her voice and demanded that i bring the dress back so she could reclean the dress
i always use the automatic machines as often as i can but it always seems the times i have to wait in line its always out the door and takes forever
they did a wonderful job on our beloved amber
everyone in the organization is friendly and i loved meeting the seniors i took the meals too
brought the wedding dress my wife had borrowed after our wedding to be cleaned
always great customer service
the bf and i have been trying to get his mom back on ecigs and off cigarettes again and for good hopefully
lindsay was extra accommodating for an order i needed done in a rush
i have never met a person who knows more about diamonds than him
everyone said it couldnt be done so i was thrilled with the results
finished up with a hot lather sideburn trim neck  forehead massage and hot towel to complete the experience
in only two days they  completed all the duct work and installed the air conditioner
i hated those experiences
just for them tosee the system it will cost us 10900 service call fee plus the first thirty minutes of labor
it was busy and the workers acknowledged us but it was about 15 minutes until we got our first drink
was reasonably priced with the competition and glad he was able to get out some stains i thought would be tough
i started going to elite cleaners because it is so close to my house
i really wanted this to be a neutral rating as this is based on price only minimum 45 to clean a mans suit can be higher depending on details
ive had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place several hundred dollars worth
he is fine now
it makes me think they will add more issues so that the insurance company will pay more
let me start out by saying i dont ever write reviews about a company i have work for us however my wife and i moved to scottsdale almost a year ago and purchased our home
it was just very disappointing as the rest of the yard turned out great
just went here to discuss getting some items printed
went there right away and they fixed it in 35 minutes
ken had the opening widened new column and new rv gates all done by saturday and it looks perfect
you can barely tell it was an aftermarket add
all around the best dry cleaners in az
rude rude rude
thanks to him instead of asking me to wait in the inexcusable line that is the post office he came out from behind the counter and walked me through the steps and in actuality i overpaid for the box
that combined with his great pricing and the fact that he is walking distance makes me want to add another star to the 5 star rating
martin came out and found the igniter went bad and made the repair
thanks so much guys
i would recommend them based on that alone
the one across unlv is monfriday only
you lack conviction sellouts
highly recommend to anyone looking for graphic print work
the whole thing took maybe 15 minutes to get my very first nice black suit
time to try another dry cleaner
im at momplex every day theyre open because i cant get anything done without their space
i told him that i was never going back to this store again and he replied with good
the following week came and i had to head back to charlotte for work and final cleaning of our apartment
i called christian back and left a voice mail
suffices to say after a wordy review i will take everything here in the future
good helpful service and a quick turn around
im telling you that no one can hear me on my phone and ive been paying for insurance for seven years
to be honest i have never used them for paper service but today while on the rare occasion that i did wait i noticed some great products
he is willing to sacrifice current  future and repeat business over the cost of an inner tube
will not be using this service again
price was quoted up front and honoured with no extra charges
training was fastpaced but comprehensive
came the next day
he leveled the table and offered a one year warranty against leveling
he helped me with what i needed just 1 stamp
found sun cellular after they were on the news
they responded basically with no
love these guys
someone had just moved out
on my 2nd visit they let me in 5 minutes before they closed and i was just hoping to drop off my phone but ronan was willing to fix it while i waited
the door says in by 10am out by 5pm
all of these negative comments are amazing
everyone is pretty friendly too
the thing fell apart when they were showing the repair to me and the slightest amount of weight in the bag would break the clasp
also when they tried fixing my faucet they only tried fixing one part and didnt realize there were other broken components until i had another company come out
i am happy with the job done but it was significantly over my budget
great place to wash your car
even though the difference was just 1 how is their mistake my issue and they are asking me to pay more
it is not a good feeling when you bump into your base board with the vacuum and you find out that it has been completely hollowed out by termites
i called searswhy do i call sears
i have already recommend to many people about him
if youre in the market for a larger appliance im going to give some sound adviceless than oneeighth of an inch worthbut one that may save you money time aggravation inconvenience unpleasant surprises mangled woodwork and maybe even an electrical fire if you weaken and make a last minute decision to become an amateur electrician

these guys did a fantastic job

after i informed them that we have been doing business with them for a long time and that weve actually referred over nine different peoplefamilies there over the years the owner blatantly said i dont care we dont need any of you or your referrals business
no reason to not be helpful
the absolute best place that i have found for storage
the couple of repairs that were necessary looked good
this business knows how to treat customers and they know how to keep us coming back
there was nothing offered for the inconveniencei am sure if you miss a payment you will be dropped faster than customer service  would answer your call
the most frustrating aspect of nys besides the carnival photo experience at peter piper pizza instead of outside where our kids play is that the schedule consistantly changed both seasons without notice

the staff is always friendly when you check out
quality customer service personnel are rare in this day and age
i have been with my company for over 25 years now and take pride in what i do
the condo was supposedly broken into and a large screen tv was stolen but when i checked the front door there was no damage to the door or frame so it looks like someone who did maintenance work or someone who also had access to the condo may have stolen the tv

i especially loved that they had a   lock i could keep a loading dock and carts we could use to transfer our stuff

i had already run an antimalware program and found nothing
i do not trust them
he used the vibram soles rather than birkenstock proper
what they didnt do was inform me they reset my cable modem to the factory settings which lets anyone who knows this value access to my system and they changed my wireless access password
all the boxes were clearly marked and they still didnt take most of them upstairs we ended up doing it ourselves

also my youngest had a very hard time adjusting to this school which is weird as this is not the first time shes been in daycare
thankfully insectek offered to come out and do a free respray even before the next regular visit their customer service is honestly really great
they confirmed that they would be able to repair it and that i wont be even to tell it was repaired
for that reason i refrain from giving all 5 stars
the gentleman quoted me 20 minute max for all repairs with less than a 20 fee
nothing plugged in and sometimes not even in the room
i cant wait to change
they have been very good at keeping the creepy crawlers away and if for any reason i notice an issue they come back out and spray in between services

try surplus asset management ask for halleplease learn a lesson from me

and anything else the contractor decides is non covered
i called mark at aquality yesterday i obtained his info via my homeowners insurance
they arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the tv

when i was in need of simple stickers and business cards i chose to patronize think
and our child loves it
mike answered gave me a fair quote and told me he can get to me in 20 minutes
the representative said my boxes were not on the truck because i had written in my apartment building rather than selecting it because it was not listed how is this my problem
from the initial contact on the phone he was very detailed and knowledgeable in explaining everything
my 4yearold had a blast
very very disappointed
as another yelper mentioned the address here on yelp is the mailing address the tuesday night meditations are at 60 lowther avenue  just follow the satipanna signs when you get to the front of the building
i pointed it out and only to find it had never been recleaned
our puppy had chewed up the corner of our famlies very nice antique oak bed and he fixed it no problem
i know i will use him again for personal and company phones
that meant that they didnt get done moving our things onto the truck until late in the night
both guys that came out to help me had great friendly professional demeanor
if you can make it there in the middle of the day youll find excellent customer service a knowledgeable staff and a couple ladies doing alterations on the spot
i just would like staff a bit more knowledable or at least pretended to care
i have gotten several things from here altered and they did a good job on each and every one of them
the owner jay is a great guy and fellow cyclist
after interviewing five different installers i chose sun valley stereo based on their strong yelp reviews reasonable pricing and knowledge of both my vehicle and their products
i will never patronize this place again
the process was easy enough
guy behind the desk spent 5 minutes telling me how busy his schedule was instead of just changing the damn thing
the plantains were good as was the sausage and the beef
she tailors everything to dresses and pants for me but she was the only one i could trust with my wedding dress last year
they did the repair on the spot in a very workmanlike manner
very personable and professional
they communicated all work to be performed
they went above and beyond to make an annoying errand pain free and actually fun
thanks ill be back
apparently theyre doing some special where you get 25 off fulltime and 15 off parttimethats brain surgery to figure out the discount given my situation huh ted
ill post beforeafter photos of the stairs that were the worst you decide
whatever happened to the friendlier staff
customer service folks
i was surprised to find out that they do not accept anything but cash so i then went to get cash and left my suit at their establishment
it was an absolutely gorgeous day to walk a few miles with thousands of others who were there to show their support
weve lived in las vegas for over 40 years and have had some experience with repair companies
why didnt you buy the part from the person who told you that you needed it
he addressed the rest of our guitar center experience quickly and like he actually cared
then one of the girls proceeded to call joe on the phone and hands it to me
so anyway each time i bring it in i always get free tune ups and they check the bar brushes and rollers to make sure things are top notch
anyhow the good news is that if this goes on long enough the store will lose business or more likely their entire franchise shut down and then shell have plenty of time to play with her phone while sitting on her ass in the unemployment office instead of being annoyed by paying customers
will definitely recommend and use again
small bike shop with caring and knowledgable employees
was in town for a couple days and needed a couple things for my new bike plus some minor adjustments
however i would recommend a different store altogether
awesome job cleaning all my area rugs which im ashamed to say were gross they look like brand new now
if you have any apple devices damages  they also have affordable prices plus with the yelp discount helps too
what great service
the selection over there is a little more on the low end but the staff is more knowledgable and honest
however i do wear things that need to be dry cleaned every now and then and ive used tatum ranch cleaners here and there for those needs over the past few years
this is their fault and now i have to write a letter
i have never had any issues at this post office
i returned to the store and explained to the guy what was up he told me it was all because it was a 3gs even tho it was working perfectly before and i should get a new phone and that yea he forgot the screws so
bring your old hangers in for recycling and green garment bags are available for purchase
we ended up agreeing right on the spot to have him service our air ducts
over all a great experience
lexy and the nannies and housekeeps usa team were fast and they really care
also they said it was really crowded
went for dinner with husband
the only thing good about this place is the price  but i guess you are paying for the quality
after trying on my items in the fitting room leon took a look at what could be done and asked what my personal preference would be
there are plenty of other storage facilities in the area
i am new in town and thought since they had a lot of good reviews that this is the right place
i have to say they far exceeded my expectations
my boyfriend and i just purchased two phat cycles from freeride and we absolutely love them
facilities are always being updated
my couches look brand new and smell great
they had installed the support beams backwards and then not bothered to reattach those feet
cornell determined what was wrong gave me a fair quote and performed the work well within the time estimated
beware of this place
fyiif you can see the mold already avoid unnecessary fees with places who may try to scare you into paying for testing many mold specialists and even the epa website says you dont need to do this expensive testing if you can already see it and know where it is save your money and just get the mold outyou will have to do more testing and get clearance with a hygienist after the mold is removed anyways no need to double test and delay the time you could be spending to get the mold out
it too a long time but they did a great job and cleaned up expertly
proceeded to charge me the 65 service charge and left
i knew immediately when i came to the shop  express wheel repair  powder coating is the real deal
i emailed fresh start and they got back to me within literally an hour
he was prompt and very efficient on the day of service
acknowledge it and make it right
amazing customer service the owner always greets you and all the work is done on the premise which to me is the most important thing so so things dont get lost
stopped in based on yelp reviews to get some help with fitting a watch as well as getting a battery
it only costed me 7027 tax included
i bring it back and they tell me it must be a motherboard problem
these people are the rudest most unhappy people in las vegas
i would recommend them for any it solution
cool little spot in kensington to drop of your shoes to get fixed and get a whiff of shoe glue while youre there

all you can ask for for your storing needs
i absolutely love this place
he wasnt here just to sell the patio
bring your camera
shoes and clothes mixed together so im having to wash and deeply clean everything
he moved hardly any items in an the hour that was allocated to load the truck
however one of the employees hovered over me the whole time i was browsing and was a little condescending and told me i didnt even listen to hip hop based on my appearance and that i must listen to indie rock
although i came right before closing they were so nice and fixed the shoes within minutes and for a great price too
they did a nice cleanup job too
i didnt pay the 16999 i took it to compudoc
i said can you call him and ask him about that
bottom line  suffice it to say all in all this is a gold star review far above what i feared would happen
we recently moved and were looking for a laundry service
after three weeks my family member was asked to leave as she was not a fit and was told that they would provide no refund from the prepayment we made and refused to provide an itemized receipt explaining the use of the funds
the only reason i gave stars is because the moving crew were outstanding
they were able to design a custom logo for me from a picture i had on my phone
i went back inside
it is very obvious that he does not read these yelp reviews andor cares what any of his customers think
these guys are awesome very friendly and helpful
you guys had my wife out so fast even the attorney was surprised
keep up the great work
he told me how to keep my floors looking their best for years to come

as soon as you put one foot inside the front door in the sales vultures attack

they have a ton of experience and treat every customer like they matter

noch eine bitte haltet mehr kontakt zum kunden
it turns out to be yet another mistake that they made with my budget billing
frustrated i paid full price when offered a free repair on second call due to their scheduling problems
within a few days randy followed up with me just to confirm what i needed and almost the next day he called me back and had an available unit for me
this time it took several more days
the download speed i pay for is 15mb but i rarely get that speed
out of the places we called eco friend gave us the best price and they also were the most flexible in terms of scheduling
they will not explain anything
no lifting at all
there are always plenty of ushers around to help you out
when i called it wasnt even about that 75 nonrefundable deductible because i wasnt looking to get it refunded
i was very pleased
i usually use stanley steamers but they are way too expensive
the staff was very friendly and i had no issues as a patron
great prices and service
my tablet had just stopped working
the staff are extremely attentive and helpful
it is worth every penny
they worked quickly while paying attention to every detail as to ensure all of our furniture arrived in the same condition it was when they picked it up
i made the mistake of so many other people and bought the groupon for 4 hours of cleaning
ive never felt pressured into buying anything and i think ive gotten pretty honest direction whenever ive asked about products i wasnt too knowledgable about
thats the power of the marketplace
now ive come by on a saturday and found a note on the window that theyre relocating to green valley pkwy
one tip i would suggest is just being a little more careful with the hose thru the house as we had just repainted the property and a couple corners need a touchup nothing horrible but i noticed it
i was told by a man who seemed to be the senior person there that no they could not do any exchanges on accessories
jessica and her husband are great
a special shout out to andy krezinski an administrator who is both professional and genuine and the first person you will meet when entering madison geeks
he is very detailed and thorough in his work
im pretty sure they have closed down and taken off already
thank you sue and joe
he then fixed the phone and it was able to charge again
dont make a move without talking to these guys
quite simply  the best bakery in the lake norman area
he was very patient let me demo two different style mtbs and based on my feedback and my longer term goals recommended the instinct
hier macht das einkaufen noch spass
robert response to that was  oh thats not roys job his job is to make the appointment
i interrupted and informed him that he was being unprofessional and he got angry and just told me to sign the papers
i had gotten a rough estimate of what alterations would be elsewhere and the prices were up there
i had originally booked my appointment to be the day after movers came and removed all my belongings from my house
i told her i had taken the day off work for this and the least they could do is give me a time that theyll be there so i wont have to take a full day and i can plan my life
go and check it out for your self you wont be disappointed
i cant wait to purchase from them in the future
top notch guys with great prices
any great service i dont usually give 5 stars but this company worked for it
again i let it slide
you get what you pay for
apparently today his or was the owner
i came not the store this morning to check on the watch
very detail oriented office cleaning
the whole team does a great job
this is a subpar laundry that doesnt live up to its limited promises
his prices are fair
ok all of these problems were minor and up till this point i probably still wouldve given them a 45 or even 5 stars
they did such a wonderful job on my carpeting through out the house
also you can go over to porchetta and co while you are in the neighbourhood
this company is preying on businesses who receive a lot of invoices that they cant keep track of andor are not familiar with web hosting
after numerous calls back an forth only to find out they cant get in touch with their one an only west side tech who obviously has no intention of showing up
i had the worst experience ever moving from california to texas
this preschool is just ok  some people are very friendly and caring some are very indifferent to the kids they are taking care of
i guess its just pure convenience that all the cutest youngest and purebred dogs have the most services needed
i recommend them 110 whole heartily
called on monday said it now wouldnt be ready until thursday
its 110 outside and hes wearing jeans
the prices are good not great but im fine with them
thank you for making the move so easy
technician didnt call ahead of time this causing chaos with the dogs and woke up my toddler
i did try a few times in order to finally make it to drop off the shoes
i would recommend them to everyone i know for fast honest service
it was explained to me that the remaining 12 tons of rock would be too much weight for the truck to handle
then the issue was with my built in micro wave claiming that he cant touch psychically touch or bring it down if he needs to install a part
wouldnt that damage have occurred beforehand and not after the package was already late
well i did find some cute earrings but i will never go back there
nothing but great things to say from start to finish
love this company
totally worth it
unfortunately there were 3 people in line in front of me the gal at the front of the line had no idea what she was doing and it was holding up the line
always take care of you when something is broken  needs replacement
first time here  great service
this shop is wonderful
he even showed us the remnants of the nest that he pulled out which was blocking the opening and causing the source of the smell
though we hogged splatoon the whole time
great faculty and a great place for precious little ones to grow
quality powder coating is not for bargain hunters by any means
loved the dry mist process the carpets were clean but barely damp and will dry very quickly
took it to data doctors and expected to pay large amount of
fair pricing and no yearly contract
went here because i had to change providers since att doesnt get service in my building
i requested a quote and the operations manager brock came onsite and provided me with a quote within the hour
6 hauptgericht plus 3 desserts und mehren getrnken fr alle fr unschlagbare 12270 eur
id give them 10 stars if i could
when i called to ask how much longer it would be before the guy showed up i was told at that time that they were coming on another day
as far as laundromats are concerned this would be well above average
i said no we specifically went over the contents of everything that needed to be moved
the gentleman went out to my car after i told him i had a bad pack what a nice guy and brought it in so i wouldnt have to and immediately started looking into the situation
i was so satisfied i gave them my leather oxford shoes to polish with complete trust
i just thought id mention it  for some it matters
john the owner has always been very helpful and gotten my repairs done promptly
wow if i could give the plumber joey gonzalez 6 stars i would
all i have to say is do not use this company
please moving is stressful enough do not use pods
the store was busy but they have a lot of tech reps wearing apple tshirts roaming around so it is easy to get help fairly quickly
after my first choice was not able to do the job i called back to cool air and their representatives phillip and stephen came back to give me another offer which i couldnt refused
this unassuming shop delivers time and time again on top notch quality print products
even reminder calls about the upcoming appointments and verification on what i am getting
terrific employees are a testament to management
paying was easier than ever with their online invoice system
simple put outstanding job
i have learned not to go to cleaners that do not do the cleaning in house
i saw a flyer at the central farmers market for dirty yoga
i had a reservation between 13 pm
they did a wonderful job
one of the first cold days of the year the temperature wasnt reaching the set temperature so we called cassel
i had my hope chest from the sixties refinished and  and couldnt be happier
the team jumped in and moved pretty much every single item in the basement around so they could rip out the carpet and dry things out
so far so good
weve bought several computers from them and the results have always been good
highly recommend so far
my kids were so happy the got their ps3 back so fast
nice folks easy to work with no bs no silly excuses no unscheduled charges
these people are unethical and crooks with no integrity
they also make on the spot alterations to any garment or can do a custom fitting for pick up in a day of two
i would definitely recommend them to my friends and use them again
ebony gave me a price of 26000 for air duct cleaning based on a 2011 quote of 51000 but she factored in the 50 discount
lots of parking
all in all a pleasure to work with and highly recommend
their social media photos are nice but its so easy to print out a couple good pieces and stage a nice instagram photo
830 still no word
i forgot to unlock my gate once and they came back out the next tie they were in the area and sprayed it then
had a price quoted from a jeweler closer to me that was outrageous  more than the purchase price of the ring
he gave me insight and powerful resources to help market my services in a way that allowed me to sign large b2b contracts with companies  in my industry
anyway kudos to the sun prairie y
efren the owner told me that tony had passed away some time ago
last year they told us some pieces on our unit would need to be replaced it was original to the house and nearing its 2 decade old mark but wanted close to 600 to do it which we couldnt swing at the time
same with the jacket sleeve fabric
mr hayes was like
in the corner of that room is the little section with play cars and nearby is the chalkboard
my most sincere thanks to all who contribute their time energy and donations to the uso
i have also never been treated this way before
most of the day went by and nothing came
turned out i had termites in about half the house and they put together a good onetime treatment plan with a 2 year guarantee
this week we were delighted to receive grout cleaning from luiz vianna jr owner of eco fresh carpet care in las vegas nv
the store was really neat and clean
the tech answered all the questions and was really patient
i will definitely be using zerorez from now on to maintain not only our carpets but in the future our tile floors
they replaced the faulty hardware at no additional charge
yes the prices are little more but my clothes have always been cleaned well and theyve never lost anything of mine
the i store is a reliable alternative to the big box apple store which always seems busy and bit crazy
this is the cleanest nicest friendliest laundromat i have ever visited
ive moved a lot over the years and never had a good experience with a mover until these dudes
we get back foster mom says we are a go come down when you can no hurry he isnt going anywhere
i just found the pricing inconsistent some of it alright a lot of it unreasonably high
if youre carpet cleaners dont use this machine well your carpet isnt really clean
had to get my wedding band customized since my engagement ring was customized in california due to my small finger size
cant ask for more than that even though yelp wants me to
my child also doesnt seem to be properly hydrated while there
wow that should cover repairing the door thanks
thank goodness to the woman at al phillips for recommending mps drycleaning
there name says it all
very happy to recommend kirk and witko windows
they sent a blurry image of just the usps express mail mailer
they have a shredding service
i love these guys lisa
she stared to wait on us poured one glass of wine
this is a horrible organization
i highly recommend integrity water solutions for all your water softener needs
my sun cracked the screen to his ipod touch
im waiting on a tshirt birthday gift for my dad
best customer service in the pest control and hvac business in charlotte
they also had a sign outside with great rates
i had a black bean chicken and corn burrito from their deli counter for dinner tonight and it was fantastic
i do not think i have ever had a bad time here
but when it came to pick up  everything that could go wrong when wrong
i strongly recommend think
5 stars all the way from me
austen answered my call today at 8am on a saturday and printed my needed banner a few hours later for an event taking place tomorrow
they hung up
lets make it later in the day when my designer is here to work with you
my phone had water damage and verizon said too bad lady
i would give one star for customer service but perhaps when if
maybe ive had too many bad experiences but i feel like other companies wouldve tried to replace the part and charge it to me or blame the failure on me to get more money there are a lot of stipulations  conditions in the manufacturers warranty saying that essentially if you breathe wrong youll have to pay for the service call but there was none of that with dinos
worst customer experience ever
three months later ac went down again and the insurance sent this company out he took pictures of the inside and coils and it showed the other company never did a thing
i have always a been very happy with clear image
updated review because its been a while
laura came through on a very difficult service with a subject who was totally evasive
i called union cab and despite being more expensive and showing up late the dispatch lady was extremely friendly
that made me laugh so hard
ok so this place is amazing
i asked to have all of my stuff dry cleaned and they laundered one of my shirts
datta took time out to call us to let us know that driver and son were safely on their way
they do an excellent job are helpful with suggestions and timely
highly recommend if you are looking for a quality bike rental when visiting phoenix
ive already bragged to all my friends about how good the service was and advised them to use them if needed
seriously had to review my order like 5x
he would have arrived around 630 that evening but i opted for another day due to dinner plans
at 1115 i get a call from my son who just happened to be home from work that they were already there
maidpro didnt show up for any of its early am appointments all over phoenix because no one called them
i emailed them initially to clean the carpet in my apartment due to my sweet dog lucie making a few mistakes
i also asked about the price of the repair for which i was quoted one thing
david dettman and his crew showed professionalism and caring for my artwork from beginning to end
monday rolls around nobody shows between 1 and 5 go through the same song and dance only this time when i finally get ahold of someone they say the driver was lost and will be on his way
a week later we called the office and were told hes also a driver so he was away on a moving haul
no problem i needed other work done they could have for a couple weeks
shantell has always accommodated us on a short notice and justin has always left our 9 year old carpet looking new
friends tell me to try the diamond center
they have dried well and cant wait to tell all my friends how amazing the company and pete did
its a fun place to shop again
i called them why not i just heard yelling from the other side of phone that they did not come to my place because no one pick up the phone
thank you sangrock
you can tell he is a straight shooter on fixing only what needs to be replaced telling you and showing you what he did and explaining everything so i knew exactly what was going on
how sad  dissapointing
they are a scam
because we took time off from work we needed to know if he truly was going to come back and if they even had the part in stock
would recommend to anyone
their price is really good too no other additional charge
i had an appointment with sandie and had to phone ahead to tell here i was going to be arriving early
this outfit is amazing
joshua was energetic extremely helpful and got us just what we needed
they are a necessary evil
these guys are great
the technician even came by a few times unscheduled  to check and spray if needed
this is the absolute only place to go if you care about the quality of the finished product
we are a busy family both with full time jobs kidfamily activities and dogs
the salads included with the entree rare these days are crispy fresh and include many toppings even cheese
when i asked him if it stops working or freezes again will he replace my lost food
he did a nice job and they were done on time
we are in a hotel which is costing much more than we had budgeted for although the hotel has been very accommodating to us and our two dogs
i will definitely come here again if needed
arrived in good time fully prepared to work
you can tell that he is well informed and well educated
i will make sure i go back to them for repairs or if my kids break another smart phone
nothing fancy just sliced french bread would have been better heated up as it was a bit cold
reading the other two reviews is a bit of a spoiler like brad pitt and edward norton being the same person
i told him that i dont have that money so he can just go
he offered to clean it for me for free even though hes only getting paid to fix the spots
after i called and called to have him come back
i have requested a cancellation and a refund and will be taking my business elsewhere
i realize that pest control is meant to be a preventative measure against bugs and is not full proof
they took my phone and i asked me to call me on my old phone once they knew what was wrong
i definitely recommend them
did i mention lazy
great selection of items on the sales floor also
took the morning off work waited waited waited
i see some people are saying their stuff got damaged or something went wrong
they do a great job in promoting safe space and are very welcoming to new bikers like myself
i view bbr as a good store with a good business model and good staff aiming to get people enjoyable systems without fuss
he has helped me with scorpions termites inside and out and ants with success every time
they were a little higher than some other guys even before tip  but you get what you pay for and if you value your time and stuff thats a good thing with movers
in fact all he could brag about was how he had increased the business since he was hired  that he didnt need my business
he is very efficient and very thorough
we had chavez jesus  omar and they busted their butts from beginning to end
she was so adorable and incredibly sweet
whatever you use it works
therefore i am a customer committed to home team
the same installer for all jobs
this place is crap
also got a little gift
a few months ago i checked around to find a good upholsterer
not very professional at all and definitely not worth the money spent with them
thats when i realized that i just paid over 30 for these folks not to clean my clothes
there was a miscommunication that wound up with a missed appointment and they came out right away and stayed late to make sure we got taken care of
there were other places i could have been investigating and would have sooner
theyve messed up an order a couple of times
i wouldnt use anyone else
i get a cord delivered every season
what kind of people do this
i think im hooked
dryers are 025 for 8 minutes of drying time
dont let apple bs you about genuine parts and warranty
we had a rat in our pantry which we discovered a few weeks before christmas after throwing away almost everything i had hundreds of dollars worth of food no sign of the rat
great helpful friendly service and nice chit chat
they charged you and did not clean at all and this is not the first time it happens
service is very prompt
the place is clean easy to access and a first rate experience
super nice people great price battery replaced in 30 minutes
one blue shirt even made it a point to not look her in the eyes and even walked around her and placed his had on her shoulder as if to ask do you mind moving over here i need to get by you
they said they couldnt do that
besides im a chicago girl and when i think cab i think yellow checker
the food was mediocre at best and a little expensive for what it was
she actually asked me not to return
plain and simple   you will receive knowledgeable efficient and honest service
after the technician left i realized the reason he decided not to cut out the old flow check valve housing
he was everything youd want your mover to be honest punctual careful yet efficient and reasonably priced
they use just the right soaps and pressure for each part of the job
its very big and clean for the most part
took one in for servicing
i would definitely recommend this company for any carpet cleaning requirements
tony at half price mounting is the only way to go
so i had doubts at that point about even having my clothes done here
you can come during the day and chilloutwork in the main room for free with wifi provided by le sans fil
the point of my review is that as a small business owner myself i would have a heart attack if i had employees representing my company like that
this store is also very close to my house across the street
sorry but in this economy i am sticking to sprouts organic which is much cheaper and better quality
i had a bridesmaid dress that i needed to get altered asap  the wedding was in 2 weeks
about a mile in both tires went flat as a matter of fact the front tire stem completely tore off the tube leaving me stranded to walk a few miles back to my car gave me time to calm my nerves
he then offered to clean my leather seats and i was amazed at how clean they got considering ive tried cleaning them myself a couple times and it didnt make a difference
their prices are extremely competitive and they are an allaround pleasure to work with
he told me wait til dry and it will look better
i recently had my yamaha baby grand piano cleaned and tuned by kelly and it sounds wonderful
offers a 90 day warranty and 5 off when you check in
i had 3 large boxes to take out of store and none of the staff 3 that were visible assisted me in exiting nor offered help
the office team who did the scheduling for the call were incredibly friendly and accommodating  i had a same day need that was taken care of promptly and professionally
i decided before leaving a review that it was important that we went to a few classes first our daughter started it go for it as young as possible which is 14 months old
after a year of living in our home with two toddlers and a dog our carpets needed help
all in under 45 minutes
he was friendly courteous and did a thorough job with great advice on tilegrout upkeep
we became customers of thomas pest control in march
my only conclusion is that the other parents have never been subjected to the public school system or perhaps not aware of the different ways our autistic community can benefit from structure and diet
thankfully i used the old noodle for once and googled iphone repair in toronto
the worst part though
well we just got the next bill and no refund was there and no discount was added when we called to inquire once again we were told out discount was never added and we have to reapply for it
i have been using golden hanger for two years
our home had 2 feet of poured concrete over the entire back yard
it is a joke
the girls were great with the kids and the playground area outside is a bonus
got balance of my order about a month later
he set good expectations for future visits and in between
this will be my go to source for custom t shirt printing from now on
i will ask for him every time
my daughter and husband inherited the couch she always loved how comfortable it was but it had so much wear and deep tears in a couple cushions from dogs we had
ok people i needed kevin again this month
ive taken several items here to be repaired or altered
overall i am happy with this company
bulwark exterminating is top notch from top to bottom
its sad to say but its so rare to deal with a service company that doesnt try to rip you off
no answer left a message no return call
highly recommend isaiah and the mobile device docs
they did an amazing job on repairing my suit to near perfect condition
jm movers was excellent
if there is a way to add photos here i will add a picture of his work compared to what i have accomplished
the assistants just sort of stood around talking to one another
we started in the early spring
matt said that would depend on the condition of the hard drive something he would know after examining it
item not damaged but their inexperience showed
last minute fix was no problem for this place
id highly recommend it
i dunno maybe they expected me to stay a while and this would cover my parking or something
i sure hope things continue to run smoothly because the post office is just one step below the mvd in terms of trying patience
i called and asked if i could bring my skirt over and she could have it ready the next morning she said sure
the quoting process was very professional and their quote was almost exactly what our insurance estimator quoted us
these guys were fantastic
i called ahs and told them my situation they said to keep my appointment with them due to the fact they cant transfer the account to another company since theyve already paid them
bring your cash though
i literally bought 2 bunches of carnations that just started to brown during the 3rd week i had them
one week later ruth called me to tell me she couldnt get her district manager to deal with the issue nor to even call me
he looked extremely apologetic and did everything in his power to make it right it wasnt even that big of a deal to begin with but ill take a discount any day
these types of shops are becoming few and far between
the technician was friendly and knowledgeable
i took a white dress here i thought would never be the same there was a huge unknown stain on it that other places couldnt touch
the estimate i was given on the phone was a bit off
they showed up on time and with a great attitude at the end of a long very hot day and were extremely friendly efficient and cautious
it always makes for a cheap and fast lunch
thank you for the help
the cleaning professional was fast and friendly
keep being the best storage west
when i was finally greeted by a tech it appeared he automatically assumed i did not know how to troubleshoot my own phone
pam is a great example of their sales staff  helpful not pushy at all
i needed flexibility and brent made that happen
they offered thier cleaning products without being pushy
mark did some troubleshooting for us over the phone diagnosed our problem told us how to fix it and we saved ourselves 300
we know well eventually have to mend the problem spot but now we have time to save for it and have already been quoted a much much more reasonable price
i wont use anyone else
a rare treat to see in the less geographically dramatic hills of ohio
our 2 bedroom apartment was cleaned after about and hour very efficient
very professional and the best quality work
they offered me no solution to this
they dont even carry 25mm audio cables and a great many other things that an electronics store should carry in stock
6112017 this is an update to my earlier review of this business
i purchased a groupon for carpet cleaning and had them also clean my sectional sofa
quiet powerful easy to use
cesar milan is a great resource
i am so happy  the boots look brand new  soft and furry
if you want a smooth moving day i would advise to not use this company
embarrassed to have people see it
this gym is really nice
i was so frustrated i didnt even use my rewards card
i also learned that this store is under new management
all this time he was walking around two shells and playing with his phone the second time another guy was keep saying to my wife  hurry up follow me hurry up she is pregnant almost 7 month
never been treated this wayever
the whole time 2 other employees sat around talking and doing nothing
my 5k ring wont be seen again
i have very long legs and it is hard for me to shop for pants at a mall so i get most of my work clothes from here and theyve never failed me
i told them to stay for as long as they need to to make sure the house was clean but they were in a rush to leave by the 3rd hour
there was a dark smudge on the carpet when they left which i had to get out myself
next time we will use fedex
then they asked me how much  was i charged
i have been paying two years for the warranty and didnt have one issue
but this is the first time and maybe this is more common than not that ive ever had management actually refuse to sell it as opposed to just quoting a price
please read and learn from our very unfortunate experience before signing with this company
we would highly recommend them and will be using them again in the future
the lady said that nothing costs 16 and she quoted 60 and i was the one that misunderstood
the guy is a dog lover
carlos was outstanding he explained what he was going to do and had my bee problem resolved within the hour
it has now been eight days and no one has bothered to call
i would recommend this company without reservation
i am very thankful for the ladies that watch over him mrs nancy mrs wendy miss jasmine
their customer service was fantastic and i plan to use them in the future for some customized drapes
and theyve got a good bargain room in the back make sure you dont miss it there are a bunch of birds in cages back there too my favorite part about the shoe box
youll walk in and think its a neat place
i must say i am very impressed
i highly recommend them
the 2nd time resulting in me getting a complaint from my hoa
the staff and management are top notch as well
we loved that
i recommend this location considering the size and the organization of the store
i am very very critical i am pretty hard to please i dont like to let other people do things and im very impatient
service was good very friendly
it was only 500
afterwards he applied two heavy coats of water based selfleveling sealer that gave the floor a nice clean even looking finish
the operations  director ensured me that the director would meet with me to go over the plan
a few days before my move i received a call from their office just as they said i would to confirm my move date and they reminded me that the movers would give us a call between 730900 on the day of the move to let us know they were on their way
called requesting service on my washing machine
the text updates provided helpful uodates
these guys were great
what a fantastic idea  underwater pool repairs
the desserts werent exciting but i did really enjoy the apple turnover
i dont know how to rate things
we have over 12000 square feet of office space and we get great service and they are normally out the next day if we have any issues
i was in awe
my personal favorites were the teddy bear display the cinderella carriage and the castle forest
when they arrived my furniture was thoroughly wrapped in moving blankets and securely stored in their truck
thanks for the great job max
now a days its hard to find a good dry cleaner that wont ruin a fine wool suit
the owner with zero regret driving all that way said it was not a problem and it was completely genuinely heartfelt when he told us he just wanted to make sure his job and his company hadnt done anything wrong or different
finally they replaced my camera with much less quality camera
they are above average in every way
i went outside once to check on them because it was so hot and i offered them water and told them to come inside the house if they needed to cool down because my original downstairs ac was still working and thank goodness for that
well that was out to rest after a quick phone call and learning that they employ a wide range of veterans from many branches of the service
so naturally i went to the century link store to talk to them about the pointless router
maybe they are a good company i dont know
i hired amanda based off her reviews and she did an amazing job
i have used az exterminators for at least 20 years for termite protection
i told him that he made it vibrate like that needless to say 0 stars avoid this place
the guy who helped us was very kind and professional
the service here is horrible unless you make and pay for an appointment i guess
stopped in 2 days later and they gave me a new battery in under 15 minutes
repack it in their long very flat box what if some of my items werent that flat
and if youre looking for fair and competitive prices this is your man
communication is quick honest and completely informative from first contact right through to delivery of your repaired piece
my mom susan had her carpets done because my dog didnt want to use the doggie door
she promised she would fix the heart and the sleeve
its really sad because as i said i think this place could be great if there was a little attention paid to detail
good service good prices and they come through
heck its been around since i was born
i had a terrible experience with this company
as long as they charge you something so they can get by that is good enough for them
i do not find their business practice to be ethical
also a very cool idea for a personalized gift for someone
first car i brought there was my lexus and since i am pretty particular i opted to get their best tint on it
he did not charge us until we were happy and we are definitely happy and never wavered in his quote
we have a dog and 2 small children so you know our floors were not their best
i was suspicious when the claim ticket had no price on it as cleaners i think typically do
david and his staff were so professional
they run deals certain days of the week and most of their stuff is pretty reasonably priced
even the waitress who saw us order it let us know it was ok if we wanted to order something else because they were the ones nobody wanted and they saved them up until someone ordered them
if i buy from an apple store i can return for a full refund for 14 days no problem
so we definitely made a mistake by showing up latethe main room was packed and we ended up sitting in the bar area
it is a great holiday experience in vegas
not these ones there is no phone service i tried  so dont count on making long distance calls
very friendly and helpful with smiles on their faces
if you have a need for quality dry cleaning check them out
i could not be happier with this business

i would say that the only negative thing i could find was that the suit salesman was quicker to show me the more expensive items
i also ended up paying more for the grooming even though i specifically discussed the price with the person we checked in with
i was able to get so much more done for myself and daughter and didnt have to worry about the other rooms except ours

on top of all of this we went on three field trips where instead of meeting in the classroom we went to some different spots around phoenix to take shots and practice different camera functions
good collection of watches and sunglassess for a small shop
i recently picked up a watch which was repaired only to find it was not working for 40000
i believe i should be able to trust them to properly do the things theyre advertising for  ffs
they were going to leave and said they would call
having experience with many shops from here to victoria bc i can say with relative confidence that they raise the bar
so happy with it and so happy with the help and service provided
anyway i had to move out that night so i was desperate for another company
unfortunately the deductible of our repair was already paid to the ac guys so the work order was put back into their hands we had a time slot for 124 my husband waited the entire time with our 1 year old in the house
anyways this place is a must try
on top of it my tote bag was missing and he seemed very unapologetic
he switched it out and had the system running within 15 minutes of pulling up to my house
my boyfriend and i went to hyde park in hopes to get my dream ring custom made
my husband was already using sexton when he and i married five years ago

the places close to my house was asking for too much money
found another store in the mall they fixed it for me in less than a minute and told me that it was not put on tight
while we were there someone was doing slight of hand and also they had musicians performing
i agree that some frustration is experienced when calling in depends on who you get on the phone but overall all desert appliances are savvy enough to recognize a top performer in andrew and i am grateful for this

these guys are super strong

i have been a patient with dr barbara newman for the past three years and i am disappointed to have to write this review
if you want to change the entire look of your home change the front door
i usually go to a different location but work brought me to this part of town
came into ces 2014 without my new business cards since they werent going to be done in time
they are very nice and professional
the owner is professional and friendly as well as his staff
the thing i love most about dcm is that i really see my son and daughter applying what they learn at the museum in everyday life especially when it comes to the its your choice exhibit which is about healthy eating habits
the customer service was no good at the store the customer service was no good from calling 611 after getting the run around from all att sales people im going to cancel my service with att and go with another provider since they cant help me buy a new phone
i have been assured this will be investigated she will do whatever is necessary to make things right
she has quite a wellrounded education in the field and it shows
they will return and fix your electronics in a timely fashion and will call you
they were very fast fixing the phone and got me on my way
they let me pay right there and all was good
but after he left the carpets were still extremely soaked
a great gym
i like low prices
no funny stuff
i have given them the instructions to get in the house and even signed a form that they sent me saying that they will use the door code to get into the house and leave the packages inside the house
bought a screen protector less than a month ago and they will not return or exchange it
because of the integrity level that is displayed through their parts counter  i think im just going to call their service guy out next time
i brought a pair of pants here and she perfectly hemmed them
they arrived outside and i went there to check and make sure they have the same items i had selected day before
they did a great job with my clothes were very professional and displayed exceptional customer service
id highly recommend hayla to anyone thinking about tailoring any article of clothing she really and truly cares about her customers
its not very often you can find a place to  do laundry that you can bear to hang out in but i finally have
my carpeting is 11 years old and they made it look like brand new
rather than getting to the root of a problem them they try to sweep it under the rug and pacify using empty words rather than action
i met with the owner elad about a week ago to get an estimate on how much is gonna cost to clean my air duct
they replaced the damaged wire and got it running
so you would rather i waste hundreds of dollars to repair a dangerously corroded water heater that will need to be replaced within the year anyway
in a very short time period they printed 75 shirts for our group and shipped them to another state in plenty of time for our event
they deserve all of the stars
the manager melissa comes across as professional articulate and seems to know what shes talking about
i do not understand why the staff in this place is so angry
sam came to service our home
i have had this piano services by other tuners who claimed that the action was not repairable and that the pitch would forever be flat
it has been a disaster
if youve got teenagers constantly breaking their idevices you need to go there
thinking i had no other options i had them fix it and paid them
called mutiple time to have them come out and service our hoods and it takes me to an answering machine which i leave the information to call back and no call back
we got a full suit with the shoes and tie a total of 250
i called the store where i originally purchased my pants and the waist differed by 115 inches of the exact same size so obviously something happened bw when i dropped them off and picked them up at the cleaners
thanks rick for saving my 1500 security deposit  always being reliable
we had done quite a bit to pack up everything in advance
since i had invoices the second opinion did not cost me anything

i dare you to try to exert my 5 year old child
he only charged me ten bucks
they dust around objects use up all your soap and put your items in your drawerscabinets theyre not supposed to be opening up your personal areas

do not go here
she only charged 6
i have a couple more of my cars ready to get done and im excited
very knowledgable and courteous
i realize i showed up right at closing time but it was the final straw
i dropped my phone
the price is finemuch like an automotive shop they charge for parts and labor
im a modular synth enthusiast and all i have to say is that the staff who know this are are nice to deal with and well informed
we have been suffering 25days now without ac
i didnt even know i had left the money in my pocket
i spoke with kevin about the bike before i bought and he was very knowledgeable
for a gym as busy as dowd i would expect the yoga studio to be larger or for there to be more than one studio
friendly quick services coupled with great prices make this an ideal dry cleaning establishment
they sold me new tires and tubes and helped me out with putting them on
both times it was really affordable and they were very tolerant of my complete dearth of bike knowledge and resulting inability to take care of my bike
the rugs look much much better
ive been getting h2o here for about 68 months
they were all so knowledgeable on the product and kept offering me options to choose from never have i met such a group of personable genuine problem solvers
they offer a lesser price if you pay cash versus paying with a credit card  which is understood up front and shared before obtaining services
and that sad think is he couldnt just put my old screen back on
my wife is not squeamish or skittish about things but she was not happy about the mouse
he was really great at explaining the spraying process was ready to answer every one of the dozens of questions i asked him about the treatment process and was just an overall nice down to earth dude
many thanks for the great service
i have been coming to this store for over 10 years
so i went over there to show them so they could order the battery

in less than 2 hours brooks was at my house and diagnosed the problem
i went down there and asked what steps had been taken with my laptop
would definitely use them again
techknow space is fast
25 out of 30 4 stars

whats more convenient than going downstairs to drop your clothes off for a dry clean
therefore we have stopped payment on the second check for 700
do not go to this place
they do tag special days like regular goodwill stores too
they were very helpful yesterday not just for me but with all the other customers
all of the work is guaranteed for two years
if i had a child i couldnt imagine bringing them any where else
i thought the complete air system was one item
one stop shop here
chris pretty much told me that either they can return the shipment to amazon and cancel my order or i can pick it up in menlo park

the basic insurance covers only 060 a pound so after haggling day after day with the company for 1 year and the insurance company they use i finally was rewarded with only 114 for my ruined desk

the owner as was the impression i received of him told me that i couldnt do that
they ended up selling me a universal adaptor generic brand which is not the right size for my laptop then tried to tell me i would need to change the jack for an additional 90

he helped me and let me know what i would need to get great photo banners for our boys
ive been donating faithfully ever since the group always needs womens clothing and shoes toiletries bath wash sanitary padstampons childrens clothing and diapers
the quality is amazing

go to a scrapyard and take my chances
less than seven minutes later she brings back my now perfect again dream dress
ken made it very apparent that what he needed to discuss with me could not be done over the phone and i needed to sit at his house for hours while he researched and created letters to break my lease    in the midst of this letter writing session ken hit on me several times and spent more time attempting to become personal rather than do his job
had an ear infection every other week had pink eye 3 times also never a notice of other kids sick
i spend a lot of time going to best buy  not only am i an electronics junkie but with gamer points you really cant go wrong purchasing from here especially when theyll price match
along with a large number of boxes and some other furniture we had them move an antique dresser from pittsburgh to boston
vor allem auch der nachtisch ist immer klasse
they would not give me straight answers talked down on me and obviously did not care to accommodate my needs at all
we will use carolina pack and load on our next move and definitely recommend them to others
i hope he can somehow go out of his business because he is soooo rude with the customers
do not go to this cleaner
i find great things but they dont really have any plus size clothes
youll find change and vending machines junk food and cleaning materials if you need anything and there are tvs and free wifi to keep you company while you wait
he told me he would not report the damaged part to our home warranty as it was not leaking
i hardly ever write reviews but i felt the job they did deserved a review
top bild und ton
kind of hard to do for broken drinking glasses and stemmed crystal
i then asked for the name of her supervisor and she refused to tell me
we bought a total of three fine watches
rather the owner will take your name and phone number and give you a yellow ticket with a day to return which is usually 34 business days
much appreciated helping hand
upon my arrival i was not told how long i would have to wait for service and then watched 4 people come in after me for minor leaks air top offs and tire problems all who were serviced before me
i will go here again and again especially since you can order any dress of the website to be picked up in the store
theyll provide incentives like a lifetime warranty which other similar products often have and what they claim is a 1012 year supply of laundrydish washershampoosoapcleaning detergent etc however they deliver this all at once in boxes as a concentrated solution which you have to mix at home
bis jetzt bin ich zufrieden

we couldnt have asked for a better company
everyone is very knowledgeable and friendly

he is ex military so he runs his operation like a one man seal team six
i guess that if you want to spend 1000 on a vacuum you are in luck

manager never called back and phone is always busy
well he was wrong
in fact the occasional small little dead bug is verification that new solutions is working
even though they save us a lot on his dry cleaning bill starting to wonder if its worth the aggravation

from when we sat down to when we finished eating it was nearly 2 hours
at storage they thoughtfully stacked the items with attention to placing boxes marked fragile on top
so this is a resource but make sure to have another couple options to pursue and know as many non charity groups they are more interested in their rules and scheduling than your needs
she does a fantastic job

i realize these cemeteries are going businesses and try to bother the staff as little as possible but i am totally overwhelmed at the warm reception i got here
ive gone in after to have a small upgrade installed and they even worked on the machine on the house and it was done within minutes
i can not remember a more pleasurable experience dealing with a plumber or home repair expert
so start off i am currently have the same problem as travis z another reviewer
i think ill start with a run
quick fix was amazing and so easy to work with
we had a major plumbing issue at 800 at night and they arrived in under an hour
a true artist can turn something old to new turn something broken to usable and turn something dull to beautiful
i would rather pay a little more for the customer service i receive and the peace of mind that my clothes will be clean pressed not lost or stolen and ready on time
it appears they hired other staff over the years to help with the business and thats probably why they now have negative reviews
also i had no good pictures of my husbands best friend who passed away shortly after the wedding from cancer
its much more suited for the 18 months to 3 year olds
like technology wizards they corrected all of my laptops issues including recommendations for further care answered all my questions and were very insightful

i took 3 laptops in that were running slow
then i found i had worn that rubber right back down to the wood
they had a complete listing so i thought id give them a call
needless to say i will never return here she was not at all helpful she kept judging me saying i was too young to get married asking if i was sure i wanted to get married it was so hot inside and she seemed very inexperienced and basically held my dress hostage until i paid the stupid 10 for her to sit on the floor
also they great selection of water dispensers
it sounded great to me so i bought the service
if you need a device repaired dont hesitate to call
mike is amazing does an excellent job
they sent leon out the next  day and problem solved
my guess would be that theyre commissioning on up selling their customers

jerry worked with me at the storage facility to ensure proper inventory of my belongings via phone since i had a representative there in my place
having worked in the downtown area for over 20 years i have heard a lot of negatives about his business so just beware
i called two days later and the manager then told me that the guy who confirmed with me was new and they dont really do that for 60 it should be more but they would figure something out when they get a box but acted like they were gonna charge me more than they quoted
after he put a guage on the tires the rear tire was 20lbs low and the front tire was 40lbs low
they were quick yet thorough professional and careful
even if you are not in the market for iron work they sell a lot of cute garden and kitchen items
all of the apartments have 10 foot ceilings so he had to work extra hard to get his equipment up to the 3rd floor
i guess if i was really into bikes this place would be my haven

be aware of this facility and its insurance policy bader company
my boyfriend decided to get my carpet cleaned because i have a dog who sometimes uses the bathroom on the rug when i dont get up in the middle of the night to take her out
also while leaving town i left 2 hours late because the driver forgot to tell me to sign some kind of document at the last minute and without it they couldnt proceed
the store owner saw me walking away after i saw the posted hours
allinall its the kind of place you enjoy going into and look forward to going back
i try to exit out wont exit out

look it up
the old man running the miniature golf ruined my sons entire evening

this local has better service than carrefour laval
he was very informative about how i can reduce them coming into the home and didnt try to lock me in or upswell anything
they were fast friendly efficient and even pulled my vehicle to the front door
paul came out within 20 minutes and explained what he would do
while i cant speak for everyone i feel it safe enough to generalize that when it comes to making the best decision for such an important occasion in a girls life since the salesperson cant avoid being part of the whole wedding experience i expect to be given the attention i deserve regardless of the cost of the dress i expect them to listen to what i want and work within my budgetand thats exactly what i got from les noces couture
the facility  appears clean but always wash hands after your finished of course
the only reason that i give this location one star is because i couldnt give it 0 stars
this makes sense because theyre open till 12 am as well
first off bartoli is very expencive they charged me 650 to launder 1 ladies shirt

great service friendly and helpful staff
i love this place
my child generally likes being there which is very important the last place she was in was horrible and she hated going
my dress was finished in 2 weeks although it could have been done earlier if i needed it to be and done beautifully
the socialization with a variety of children and the checks and balances that are built in with so many ppl around to see how your child is being treated provides a great deal of peace of mind
i have a red leather sofa which had become shades of pink and maroon due to sun exposure and grunge
she said the fix was simple and wasnt sure why cherie said it was the best she could do
choose vegas bail
towards the end they just started putting a lot of boxes in the front of our house and not where they said to go so unfortunately we had a lot of heavy boxes that we had to move to their rooms later
if you havent had your carpets cleaned with the power of citrus i highly recommend it
prices are reasonable and fair for repair and also for purchases
my iphone went for a nice leisurely swim in my pool and i thought it was going to be forever down for the count as a result
id go out of my way to use these guys again
in todays day and age you have to have customer service
in the ten years ive been in vegas this is the best dry cleaner ive ever used
the parking lot is very accommodating
the only downfall is they dont change diapers
it is impossible to overstate how much we tried to inform the company the particulars of the new site which were not internally conveyed to their moving team
when i get in the store he tells me we found a man who was able to jumper wire the connections of the chip and solder them back to the motherboard
efficient dryers and washers of all sizes
a hidden gem in las vegas more tourists should make a visit
bait and switch
also they advertise same day dry cleaning
he was so fast

for the price he charges and he comes to you if you go to a shop here you will pay double not to mention have to drive there
i highly recommend gary of element carpet cleaning  he is prompt reliable pleasant and does great work
they gave me a trade in for my broken laptop and i left with a new one
i have a couple more of my cars ready to get done and im excited
i was hesitant to do so but asked about an atm and as i started to leave he mentioned that if i had a credit card or something he could keep for the day i could use that
i highly recommend this place
i figured it was something that needed to be done and if it would cost an extra 100 then it would still be worth it
this little place is tucked in on the side of a shopping plaza
not what you would expect from a company like this
shes professional fair and honest
they even call to now and then to check in and see if we are having any issues
uneducated staff with no heart
this place is a stateoftheart health and wellness center with 2 group exercise studios five locker rooms a double gymnasium and a runningwalking track
we will be back and recommend you to all our friends
i gave her the benefit of the doubt during this visit due to the nature of what i was sending
they will suck your time and your soul as you beg your friends and family to sign up for their worthless services
i rode my bike here two days ago and the because of the heat the man was asking if i needed water or help getting my bike out the door
a week later they said they would take three more days
a few months ago the worse thing that can happen to someone who lives and works by cell phone and that is a broken screen
we chatted on the phone about what i was looking for and that i wanted to make a move into a management role with little management experience
i actually drive further to use a different one
my fianc absolutely loves her ring and jessica even worked with us to have it resized so she could wear it on a trip she was taking the next morning to see her parents my fianc was equally impressed with their service and friendliness

when the apple watch came out i purchased one immediately
rented a pickup truck and everybody was so nice and helpful
i pray i never have to move again if i do i will be calling them again
i then told him i had lost my receipt unfortunately so i was then passed on to his manager im mad i didnt catch his name to see if they could pull up my emailed receipt
if its not buying stuff in store they do online pickup purchases quite smoothly too
never in a million years did i think id review a shoe shine place
they moved my entire home with care and speed and with no issues even though it was pouring rain the entire time
really glad i found them
sometimes he doesnt charge me for the extra service done which i think is a great attitude towards the regular customer
then i took my favorite pair of black skinny pants there
the price was double what other places charge to snake a sewer
thanks joel
so its a great place to get any kind of washing you need done
they had no problem taking my money and sending me on my way with a piece of crap guitar
the dressing room is clean and nice and private
he patiently answered all of my questions in reasonable language
this is before they even started loading anything
i really appreciate the honesty and the help
i donate a lot of items herekeep up the good work

epi iron  welding recently fixed a side gate for me after the previous installers had done a mediocre job
i bought a deal for carpet cleaning and scheduled my appointment
since he overcharged me for the 2d home he lost out on the 3d home which was larger
just like any dmv i know to get there as early as possible to avoid waiting hours
i recommend leo for all types of home cleaning
amazingly it still passed the apple battery test so they would not change it
i will happily recommend this company for any of my friends going through water damage
was very happy with the outcome of my carpets
great customer service
the technicians said that they couldnt remove the stains
he offered us a free computer tune up when we came in and was very helpful and knowledgable
more wasted money
they are life savers
this review has nothing to do with an individual sprint store
maybe it was to avoid having to look the patrons in the face
one for my family and a boudoir session for myself
i brought my dads older singer in to get checked out it was making a terrible squeezing noise while sewing
i thought the mac n cheese was even better than danny boys
great service and the turn around time was amazing
i found this place on yelp and and they are just the nicest and most professional people
there are a lot of horror stories on there of other peoples personal experiences so i was very relieved when i found my ninja movers
everyone seemed very satisfied with alex
staff was very friendly and helpful however when i picked my dog up he had a couple of good sized open cuts on him
we got along well with the caretakers the front desk and always paid on time
make and appointment on line go in and get seen on time  easy
i told him he already did that and needs a new flush valve
finally i made the best decision of my life i emailed alchemy desperate for help
i had a tshirt that i wanted to have some writing put on the back
karl and mike were the best movers ive ever encountered
i highly recommend them
i had forgotten what color the carpeting actually was and it was sooooo clean  fresh that i secretly was wondering if somehow he had magically installed new carpeting while i was gone i watch all that conspiracy theory stuff
we stood there and measured the pant leg together to show the difference and they saidwell i dont know if thats right
first time they came out it was fine
lies greed and deception
i couldnt have made it any easier for them to make money
i have used this place for 5 complete remodels that i have lived in myself and have never had a single issue with any of the appliances
i sent indira a message with a photo and requested to schedule a followup appointment since i had paid for four hours but only received two a reasonable request right
called this local place for a repair and it was so worth it
danny has helped us the last couple of times we have gone in and he always has a smile on his face
beyond the issues of cleanliness the outrageous number of people throwing balls of all types torpedoes and whatever else they can think of eg
my family has used bobbies for years
i took it back in  needless to say i was not happy at all it was explained to me that the beads had melted in the cleaning process  that they would pay for it
i went to a few places and werent really satisfied with their evaluation of how they were going to do it
brightstar was very professional and did a great job hiring well trained staff and making sure that you find the right cnas for your circumstances
the rep on the phone was extremely friendly but not to the point where it was weird
i spent some time on the phone with her discussing my problem and she was more than willing to take the time to listen and provide her knowledge and experience in dealing with these kinds of issues
you cant go wrong using this outfit they are as good as it gets
thats their response to a loyal 7 year customer who has spent thousands of dollars over that seven years in service calls
we first called adam at precision chemdry two years ago to clean our apartment before we moved into our house
his rate was about 60 of what i expected to pay  and way less than the 330 minimum one of the other companies wanted
i was informed that all was well
allinall though great place
i did call and complain to office about pace of work at the start and they sent out another guy
in and out and everything done with little problem there was no pushy sales tactics just great customer service
i wholeheartedly give expert tech the highest rating
this is the big bad gubmint were talking about
not only did he follow those instructions he even suggested to not taper them as small as the reference pair because of the thickness of denim
i called rude office lady and she told me someone had cancelled my appointment yesterday at 1637 because the leak was in plumbing not appliance
josh and his team have been rockstars
he called two nearby locations where the truck had been to see if they might have seen it
the machines do run from a coin card
as a matter of fact atul talked me out of a more expensive process as it was not appropriate for my application
call know what u need
with moving and getting everything done i got my days mixed up
after showing her a pic of my last haircut a very bad one but it was all i had in cali she went to work
they made the repairs the next day and now everything is running perfectly
in an age when customer service can be lacking it was great to find someone so nice and helpful
much appreciated that they wrapped a lot of bubbles wrap for shipping
he called me during the day complaining about having to go to the far side gate that everyone with bigger trucks has to go through
great service very friendly staff shout out to jessica and bernice
i think they would tell you if it was outside their expertise and if they accepted the job it would be done promptly and professionally
that apparently is just to remove the bees and not the honeycomb
i would give a 0 star but his worker handled the situation and it at least warrants one star
they even offered to price match if i could find cheaper
so glad i found it
never a sigh or sign of annoyance even when given a rightful opportunity
horrible staff and office they never pick up the phone
they are not for everyone
i love the ease of the fedex dropoff box located inside that is not picked up until 545pm
i was not prepared for that and had to leave and secure a payday loan so i could get my belongings
moving to a new location with small children in the middle of winter  is a recipe for disaster
great service today dropping off a large package to be shipped
this company is the best
i cant say enough about dan
this company lets female associate call you who doesnt even want to tell her neme to me
horrible customer service
it was night and day
need junk removed
again i have other properties with pools that need work but i will be going some where else
girls have a license and they got classes so massage was really great and we actually enjoyed this time
currently we are waiting on parts but i feel like were getting good service with oneguard
never ever ever use this company
for the past few cleanings torina and chastity was our team and they get two thumbs up
so i stopped in here on saturday morning
used these guys twice to rent a uhaul for moving purposes
i read the previous reviews and felt personally offended
lychee dragonchee and cranchee so far are absolute favorites of mine
best customer service i have ever received
he went out of his way to be accommodating
i most definitely and highly recommend ebail
she at first was very helpful
almost one month later we contacted craig to let him know we were about a week away from closing the first opening he had was one week away from our then scheduled closing which ended up being a week late so it worked out perfectly
an hour later they were here
overpriced  unclear descriptions of classes in terms of whether it is for people who are at an advanced intermediate or beginner level
also awesome staff that is super accommodating and knowledgable of the curation of books in this store
daniel is a true professional
ripoff in my book
i dont have time for this type of nonsense
i know it says tailor in the name of their store but ive never had anything altered here
was supposed to receive a call yesterday from ron to finalize this crappy experience and he didnt call one again i guess thats what will consist of today
i called on a sunday afternoon and he had two 4x8 racks installed in my garage by lunch on monday
way to go
the teachers had the most influence of this
what the heck
for the loading process
driver was on time and very courteous
if you are wanting fast friendly good priced guaranteed work this is the place to call
if you need anything with bmx come see him
they were pleasant patient organized  and very careful
i have lived in tempe for over three years and have not found a cleaner that i trust more with my clothes
buying insurance through this company is useless as even if you buy it you have to prove that they actually boxed your stuff
who ware it
he has fixed many pieces of mine quickly and economically
my mom has been to this location before and said they were so nice and never charged her
i was a bit disappointed in our snack as i was expecting something really cool
i would definitely recommend this place
on my most recent visit i reserved a truck online but later wanted my dad to be the driver
both had to be thrown away
they carry vintage hats at a great price of 2 to 3
quick and efficient
ive been using them now for over a year and i love them
my husband and i both bought our wedding rings here after a terrible experience at tbird
i told her i thought it was ridiculous i turned and walked out
hands down the best movers ive ever worked with
they were so nice and professional having my vacuum fixed and good as new in 20 minutes
during my visit i had the great pleasure of dealing with john
he promises me that one day years from now his shop wont be there anymore
a screw had come loose that was stopping the movement
all of this time i have now apparently went through a billing cycle and was charged a full months price even though we didnt have a working dispenser or cold water
i get a call on the way down to this office saying they didnt have the truck i request but they could give me a 14ft
weeks and weeks roll by and no update from them whatsoever
jeff and his son are amazing i wouldnt go anywhere else for my jewelry
i had ants then bees then crickets
very professional and friendly
we needed the documents the next day and beth the manager was willing to go above and beyond to make sure that we received everything we needed in time
unable to get any assistance from verizon jacob quickly assured me that he would do his best to find a solution  and he did
i was already displeased with everything but in my mind i thought hey at least i was pretty much going to be wasting a quarterno
dont think you can complain and get results either because the director is also friends with the regional director connie
thanks gary for the outstanding work and ethic
this apple store is always busy
moving is always very stressful my friend recommended this company for me and they did a really good job
did not seem very promising to drop off my 2 most expensive pairs of shoes per phone call
best laundromat ive ever used
i called regarding a leak in my house this morning and dennis arrived in 20 minutes
i asked that they fix it
i went in with a general idea of what i wanted although was open to trying others
ive recommended deseret to everyone i knew and my sister and i always made this deseret the first stop on our usual thrifting route
they offer all the services you can imagine for a mail and copy center
i will definitely use dms plumbing again should the need arise
i went in for a watch battery replacement and walked out less than 5 minutes with my watch working again
they use wall guards to protect your walls
amazing customer service
the tech philip took a quick look and stated that he would have it ready for me e next day
my mom called to let them know what happened and they immediately denied any fault on their end
i was nervous thinking i was going to spend hundreds of dollars for my new iphone 7 and be there for hours
they literally charge to the minute
these guys only charge 50 for a 1 year warranty provided you have no current termite activity
what other restaurant can boast that
shes friendly nice and hilarious
its worst to say but i have to reveal that the my kid teacher shows race discrimination which is not at all acceptable
we highly recommend this company
i cannot stress enough how much life you are extending when you get your carpets cleaned regularly
i guess thats the difference between east coast and west coast
you took our options away by not catching it and then not owning up to the responsibility
2 stars because they tried to fix it but i definitely wont be back there id rather drive an hour away to where theyll do it right
at the moment im a little overweight but heres the facts every summer i road bike in italy
i stood for a couple minutes while the employee was doing something behind the counter i know she knew i was there an she didnt even say anything like  ill be right with you
which is a huge concern considering i just paid around 1300 for it along with best buys protection plan
we definitely will call him again and recommend him to others
there was a minor billing snafu and they quickly and kindly remedied it
just had my grass replaced with bermuda pro synthetic turf from turf hub
i told him i had company coming and i needed it completed in 7 days
i also appreciate that they were very respectful as family who helped with the move were mostly comprised of females in the past weve been subject to some unnecessary sexistflirtatious remarks from other movers
the room is bright and clean the vibe is loving and welcoming and every time i walk in both teachers are engaged in songs dances or games with the babies
everyone that works here is very friendly and makes it comfortable to be at a gym environment
my joining fee was waived
the summerlinlakes community is lucky to have this gem of a place serving it
as a bride most people want to take advantage of you because they know most are willing to spend more because its our special day but im thankful they were fair and genuine
he died 9 years ago so it was a very sentimental find
he tells me that he is helping another customer but will find someone the whole time he is helping the other customer he is complaining about the new ceo and management and how the company is being ran
david fimbres was the tech and was very nice efficient obviously knew his field well and went above what was just his job
as an apple stockholder and imacipadiphone owner im very disappointed
adding a star because the new location is great and in appreciation of all their specialty pizzas since my original review ive tried a bbq and the chicken bacon ranch both much better than their traditional tomato sauced pizzas which i am still not personally a fan of
is that for one shoe
this place likes to rip people off
i love helena and recommend her work to everyone
i felt so bad that i was unable to be there to help so i thought to call a delivery service
i contacted david after getting quotes and advice from other companies and listening to lots of sales pitches
friendly customer service
this company not only provides an amazing finished product their customer service was the best i have received in a long time
i would not recommend triple 7 to anyone unless you enjoy poor customer service and your belongings to go missing
finding a sales associate on the floor can be hard at times but at least the checkout is usually fast and efficient
my wife was very pleased
someone else answers and tells me the owner is on vacay and he would be more than happy to call him and see whats the word on my laptop
which i was intending to do everything there was junk and the service was terrible
i walked into this place not knowing that theres a difference between acoustic and electric strings im glad that i asked
the location i went to specialized in clock repair but even they had to outsource the work
this is the only apple store i go to for anything wrong with my apple products
i actually learn from his guy
he did a wonderful job and was professional and considerate
that took an expert to diagnose
also picked up a cool ass talking ted bear for my cousin and a crock pot for my mom
i actually found this company on yelp via other great ratings and i am happy to report that todds services and professionalism exceeded my expectations
he was absolutely an expert in his field and took a very long time to explain the many possible problems i had with my well and my pool
obviously an attempt to hold off paying their debts
the only reason i have allowed this to go on for so long is that my landlord has set this appt
she got scared
would highly recommend to anyone looking for daycare
they have come each week as scheduled to service the pool

i had never heard of surefire until my wife found them here on yelp
took a brass bottle opener that i got for my husbands graduation
also last time i checked disenrolled was a very real word and used properly in the context of a conversation mentioned in a previous review
i was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency and friendliness of the clerk
i will not return to this bike shop
the price was not what i was told it would be
im so so glad i chose lana for my wedding dress alterations
place is dirty
so fast and easy
they have a office for your use and a main room to chant and a over flow room
mail plus was our nearest dropoff location
i love that they are adamantly instilling good behaviors and manners encouraging the children to say thank you please sorry when needed and taking turns
i finished also getting a new look from them
totally had to change this to one star
then several weeks later i received a call stating that my violin had arrived
on the bright side i was able to go back to the store and pick up the 2014 overdrive sport not the bike i ordered even though i had ordered the crappier bike in the picture
i am now taking him to a plastic surgen to laser it
i had very modest expectations and was blown away
we would definitely use them again if need be
feeling dejected i declined and told him i was getting a bad vibe from him
very professional and an excellent job was done for 2 rooms and a couple of hallways
even the teachers regularly in the older age group classrooms know my infant daughter by name
i now have a laundry debit card full of credits that i cant use for a while as i have my own wd at home and only came to wash my bed spread
this place has become my goto vape shop
she told me if i wanted money to just go to a pawn shop
i didnt know what she wanted and didnt want her to shop with me because i wanted to suprise her with my proposal
the owner was rude and the ups store down the street charged a lot less for shipping the same packages
like being in a real italian familys house instead of a chain restaurant with decor thats trying to emulate it
they turned out to be as good as the other reviews made them out to be
i specifically asked the lady if it would be noticeable and she said they would do their best by which she meant very little
even their website is a scam
ive had a bunch of problems with my products and this is the store to go
twice a month
plan to go here for my next jewelry or watch repair
now hes got a full staff working on every bike imaginable in a newly renovated shop
coming from california i am by far impressed by the efficiency
thank you for everything patrick
he was great though
what also i really liked about this store is that you get a receipt with a 30 day money bsck guarantee
i sat in this cute little vintage shop for all of 5 minutes enough time to spy the delicate  little shoe ornaments hanging from the ceiling
my son went here for 3 months then i pulled him out because they have very long nap times
the good things solid location and if you need some lights or something in a pinch you can get them here
thanks so much jesse
while i realize that ever know and then you will run across an employee who seemed like a good fit at the time of the interview but turns out to be a detriment  sometimes costly  to the business there is still the responsibility of the management team to insure that the people who interact with your customers whether they are direct or from major entities like samsung should be treating those callers with respect and common courtesy
i not only feel cheated out of my money but as if i was betrayed for relying on getting what i paid for
you dont spend hundreds of dollars on designer shoes and give them to a hack place to fix them
their first quick repair did not hold but these guys stand behind their work and got it done right
i ran out on errands and when i got back thinking they would be done they werent even close
i took full responsibility for my mistake ordered a new shirt but he was seriously inconvenienced by my order
we had originally scheduled them to come at 8am to get things started
they did same day service and really helped me out
sporadically for a few months my apartment management had issues with their former mailboxes having had various problems that the carriers had been a stickler about when it came to delivering our mail
they seemed organized and helpful
employees are very customer service oriented
i went in over a month ago for a small engraving they are so nice and efficient
thank you for your help
i was truly suprised
most of it is simply another comeon which is so typical of this city  grandiose ideas toned down by mediocrity in execution
they even had an extra man but because i had only paid for two they did not charge me
open from 600 am to 1200 am that is fantastic
they are always polite and show up when they say they will
did i mention miss lavrene was great
they have a large selection of petite pants
marcia is great at her profession and will take care and detail to even small projects
now you would think a ups store would know these things before asking you to pay 6039 to ship a box
my experience here was good
we had a lot of yard debris from trimming our shrubs and trees a lot of it was very sharp
called morning of repair offered earlier appointment  again didnt fit into my schedule
not to mention it doesnt smell bad like a lot of thrift store do it smells like apple airfresheners
he explained that this particular pest was hard to get rid of  and living in a apartment complex made it even more difficult
it is too bad cause this drycleaner use to operate pretty smoothly
its pretty much nothing was going on
friday that week
lots of colors to choose from as well
i was really impressed with this sprint store
got to start booking
first of all i didnt realize it would be 50 to ship a 3 lb box to hawaii
my pest control service has been cancelled
if the customers are not supposed to use the mailing labels provided why do you make them available
cant say enough about wes
ordered components online from five different companies
joe made suggestions and let me chose what i thought was best for me
i called rick he said he would see if his guy was in the area and i received a call back and set up an appointment
no service was rendered and i had not agreed to pay a trip fee

give this daycare a shot
so much frustration
quality work to the fullest
easiest computer repair ever and at a great price
she knew exactly when i put my clothes in and that i had been there shortly before
so much better than the other fabric stores i have  been to in the valley
couldnt allow them to clean over because my husband was leaving within 2 hours for his flight
they managed the entire process from organizing the items in the estateestimating their value and conducting the sale through the disposal of the remaining items
james seems to remember and care about my particular pest problems which means so much
you used to be amazing but not anymorenow imagone
the movers came packed up my belongings and put them on the truck
he and his son christopher were very polite knowledgeable and professional
when driving back and forth to   casa grande the coverage going in and out of 4g signal throughout my drive home
a few days later i went to another shop in town
this business is great and joe is the best plummer ever
quick  cost effective
so i grab my receipt and take my phone back and explain to them the problem
looks new again
over the next week i proceeded to call 23 more times
isaac asked me what was the problem and i explained
he treated it like a nuclear reactor core  refusing to let me handle it
there are many days where my child comes home without eating anything all day
why stand in the regular line just to be laughed at when you mention you were waiting at the other window and the lady says oh well
if you google this place you will see that in 2010 there was an article about their owner being upset over all of the negative social media
the water heater guy was a complete cocky ahole not only called 10 minutes before the last possible time he could be here they told me between 912p and said itll be another hour or so no apology
this time i had a leak somewhere in my house as my water bill increased each month
its much better than walmart
initially this company was easy to deal with
he scheduled me in very quickly
mike our service manager was a blessing
however the special hopper where you are supposed to put those packages is frequently full which means it can not be opened
i noticed on the website that current military and retired military were able to get in free
these guys hustled
green cleaners had the most reviews and everyone had something positive to say
here i am assuming that the computers are sending information to print a photo print on photo paper because 1 thats what i told the person at the counter i needed and he didnt tell me otherwise and 2 the sign on the computer said prints
the employee was courteous engaging and removed links for 10 bucks in a few minutes no problem
they were  not only professional  courteous nice and quick they were cheap
i might as well buy a brand new one
they had a massive water tower where you could shoot balls into the air a section to building water traps water cannons to shoot chimes with and just all sorts of fun water activities to play with
having our hand forced we allowed them to send the poorly rated company and of course their opinion was the same as the first one
a very sweet iraqi couple own and operate this business
i love this place
i cant thank las vegas wedding gown specialists enough
i drop off over 15 dress shirts twice a month
disgusting and unsanitary
i would like to reserve a 17ft truck for 9am ok no problem you are all set
if you can deal with the hassle of parking they validate within a very limited window of time its worth checking out
on the day of my appointment he called 15 minutes prior to let me know that he was on his way
we verified this with the repair company after the registrar of contractors opened up a case inspecting this
when i got the pants back some of the hems were so sloppy
the launderette wasnt super busy either on a saturday lunchtime either
very professional team
the blank looks on their faces of people who hate their jobs and lives but who work in this inefficient hell hole for their guaranteed paychecks
they cleaned my dress and burned the arm then tried to cover it up
do not ever use this company
im examining my new phone and i notice two hair line cracks and the screen wasnt fully glued down
thanks preventitive
my boyfriend referred me to this store as i was using a complete dinosaur of computer to finish my undergrad
based on yelp reviews i took my tumi backpack to have a sleeve sewed onto the back so i can attach it to my rolling suitcase
installed the main variable speed pump and the water feature pump in a couple of hours and they work great
very cool place
the drivers are also very friendly too
no pen no paper and no ink
worst experience ever
we also scoped reviews and deals online before we saw it here for the cheapest
they send person over who kept guessing what to replace to find the leak
we had a leak in our courtyard faucet
make sure to read my previous review about my full experience and the other reviews even the not recommended ones
hope it lasts
they came out the next day and inspected the property and discovered that the house was heavily infested
unless your a bug rat or pigeon
i have watched other pest control pros do their thing and they are amateurs compared to urban pest
also found out they cannot refund the money they took out of my account due to their error all they can do is just credit it to the next month
we went on a 3 hour tour of the sanctuary and he explained everything in detail
does amazing neat work
from the first just browsing visit all the way through to picking up my finished custommade engagement ring my fiance and i were welcomed warmly and personally
avoid this store
seriously like 20  it gets five stars because it is the closest thing to the feeling people must be describing when reminiscing about a candy shop that i have ever felt
they charged me a very reasonable price and i am happy and cool right now
i was told it would take 4 to  5 hours to remove the wax from a 1000 sq
what i had cleaned here i brought some ties to get them cleaned it was the perfect location since it is downstairs in my building
the lap pool has four lanes designed for actual swimming as opposed to an oversized bathtub for people to float around and soak in
the bride who is plus size had shopping at veras for a gown and ultimately bought one elsewhere
he was able to adjust my heavy glass shower door by filing down the bottom so that it would open and close properly
weve had an entire dinning set of chairs reupholstered and will be picking up another casual antique chair tomorrow that theyve redone for us
i have used integritys service on a monthly basis for nearly a year
i called them 3 days in advance and they said it was still ok but the day before the appointment i got a call saying that i can no longer come
save yourself the frustration buy your bottled water at costco or get a water filter thats what im doing now
i dont use cpp and never will
when i asked the clerk what the breakdown was she couldnt even tell me
i needed some very basic business cards for the asd show
my husband and i take all our cleaning and alterations here
i dont know why its so bad there must be something mystical or an alien forcefield preventing 511 from working correctly
in particular steve mohawk guy with a barcode tatoo and a twentysomething girl whose name escapes me tall thin with mediumlength brown hair  sorry i forgot your name
she has the knowledge for all your moving needs
the other companies seemed to present low price  low quality options
on a positive note they did show up on time and call before they came
he was clean and knowledgeable about the problem to fix ithe even spent the time to program the surround sound system and each individual speaker and spent the time to reprogram all the remotes to work properly also
i call back two days later and get apologies and an install date for the following morning
easy movers lived up to their name
these guys are awesome they live up to their yelp reviews
our return trip from a restaurant was doubled because the driver of taxi car 2499 took us 12 blocks out of the way
ordering their tender delicious kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket
ive gone here a few times and theyve always been friendly and done a very good job on regular stuff
they were very good and accommodated my schedule thank you
eos fitness is amazing
it tell me it is management lacking an interest in serving customers rather they are just focused on getting clients money and focused on their profits without having any consideration for their clients
now its back to normal and i couldnt be anymore thankful
this was our first stop after we landed in phoenix
the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly
there werent a lot of merchants and many of those present had run out of their wares
they really did a great job
would definitely not reccomend
oh yahoo mail cant be accessed unless you go through yahoo chat and login that way
it was awesome
all he could have said was im sorry she failed to mention that normally we do
drop off was even quicker
working in the evenings cons very poor quality cleaning of laundered garments terrible pressing and folding of dress shirts overpriced only game in town if youre inside talking with the customer service and someone drives up they drop everything and ignore you mid question some staff are downright unfriendly not open very late give discounts if you post a yelp or facebook review that seems against the rules so compared to other cities ive lived in this place is terrible
ive had them drycleaned here and although i cant remember for how much i know the price was fair
the xbox is working great now thanks guys
very hard working and super nice
this company went above expectations
finally someone answered and said the technician called and no one was home
clinton is the man
of course i wont
they do excellent work
i had my ring resized in a matter of about an hour
found this co via a google search for koozies
most experiences were fine with the exception that they seemed a little inconsistent in their pricing
my storage needs have changed from smaller 5x5 units up to larger garage sized units during that time
a few weeks ago they replaced the battery which was running out quickly
if you want a quality seamstress that does amazing work you must go to sadie
their email invoices are terrible
another note sun cyclery has an awesome selection of bike accessories
interaction to schedule an appt was very good
the worst was shea the supposed supervisor
i am not going to say they guarantee this
great friendly and fast service
love this placebeen there 2 timesstaff is friendly and answer all questions i have
excellent rapport qualit prix par rapport aux grandes compagnies de dmnagement
at the time of my quote which i completely understand is a quote and not a promise i had four large aquariums a three piece couch set 55 projection box tv and more crap than youd think could be in a one bedroom apartment my estimate was 4700
the owner michael does not even know whom his customers are when calling in lied about paperwork being sent in to warranty company had not done it yet responds with one word answers busy etc
we just had our first treatment done at our home and jose did a wonderful job
i recommend bringing your own sharpieink pen and tape because they do not have any available and its kind of expensive there
we just had our carpets cleaned and after 10 years in the house  they now look brand new
i was greeted promptly when i arrived by katie who was extremely helpful and polite
amazing place that ill always pay a visit whenever i am in vegas
we have had cox for 25 plus years
he was very thorough in his inspection and only found the bugs in one room
service was great
the restoration crew came in after and let me just say the restoration result looks better than it did before the water damage
some companies use rotating motorized brush
youve got our business from now on mike
i need that money to  pay property taxes
they came back on two occasions to attempt to make the roof uncomfortable for the half dozen or so stubborn pigeons
they put me on a couple of bikes to try them out and adjusted my bike to fit me perfectly
the staff is friendly and helpful
i love how they package your dry cleaning for pick up by crossing over the arms and connecting them
i have an htc evo
my daughter flew in from la  for her sisters wedding on a thursday early evening
he cut out a long threeinch strip of the countertop when he hooked up the new double oven and then just left without saying a word about his mistake
mike got back to me quickly about arranging one of the employees to pick it up at a convenient time for me and when dropoff would probably occur  luckily their turnaround time was only a few days
the guy did a good job repairing my phone
when i decided to get back into cycling as an adult i bought something cheap
and sometimes i hit up wendys for some nuggets and fries while the comforters are in the washing machine
they are more than friendly and helpful when you are looking to rent a unit but good luck dealing with them when vacating
mastermind moving was awesome
i am a repeat customer and recommend it to everyone
they charge 75 a day for drop in and 18000 a week for 2 days you reserve for the next week
theyve also got a few food choices  cheeseburgers hot dogs fish tacos
the only reason they dont get five stars is because they scratched my brand new flooring
simply the best
the special was 4 rooms for 59 he then told me that it would cost more for additional  chemicals
we decided to check out this one
abdul is nice guy and he helps me a lot
they charge way too much anyways
we did speak on the phone and you were very condescending
the technicians have always been thorough and efficient and we havent had any issues with bugs since switching to them
im not going back to buy shoes here ever again
while we apologize for any inconvenience you may have suffered as a result of this unfortunate incident our investigation has concluded that there was no negligence on the part of 407 etr in operating and maintaining the highway 407 at the time in question
as we are now renting with plans to purchase within a year or so i plan to utilize creative moving again for our next move
very very unique and delicious and im from nebraska where bng is a food group
so at this point he is guessing at was is causing the issue
in retrospect i hate my dressit was the wrong fabric heavy satin in june i was dying hot after 10 mins the wrong body shape i am thick in the middle and ended up in a drop waist
our home was recently repainted and had stone veneer added to multiple areas
two months later the screen is falling off
the 4th day i texted them and said what gives
they give you the run around over and over again especially if you want a refund
i chatted with him briefly
had to verbally give directions to my home
they refused to compensate me at all for the damage including refunding the cleaning that they had charged me for
i tried to get some stuff printed here and the woman who was supposed to help was pretty much the opposite of helpful
my phone looks brand new and the customer service was awesome
he was professional and honest and prices reasonable
i walked in at 9 am with a pool pump that was inconsistent and they had me out the door ten minutes later with a repaired pump and bill under 15
if you ac stops blowing make the right call to legacy air
i waited 3 days and paid for a pump that was in worse shape than the one i was replacing
we moved into a new condo and had our carpets cleaned by another company and many of the stains didnt come out
unprofessional to say the least
that policy is the most absurd thing ive ever heard
not going back
ive never seen my bike so clean and shiny as it is now after just a standard tune up service
thank you guys for all of the help
they have never disappointed me
this is my new favorite apple store
theres a grocery store
definitely the best prices ive seen in cu whether it be for a tuneup repairs or buying a sweet bike great variety of vintage and brand new
over the past two years i have tried two cleaning companies and bought a carpet cleaner and tried myself
at 11am the door bell rang i was impressed as many of you probably have experienced it is rare for any business to come on time or even show up in the valley
i grew up in scottsdale and this company was always the best dry cleaners but that has changed
we still pay for weekly service
they came out the same day in the evening
garrett was very helpful and i feel i have what is needed for the plumber when he comes next week
pest control service review tanner was our serviceperson
doesnt get any better than this
3  the best safeguards that i can imagine
after 11 years of doing business with them the quality of customer service changed and we felt it was time to move on if the company values didnt match our own
it may not be placed in the best area of town but its service is impeccable
we live in the neighborhood and the guys are always happy to air up our tires and oil our chains
dusted every bookshelf the high potshelves the china cabinet the glass display cabinets and shelves  along with all the stuff that they removed cleaned and replace on the shelves
i would definitely come here again for phone troubles and to buy phone accessories at a reasonable price 15 for an iphone 56 charger as opposed to almost 30 at a best buy
we unpacked boxes of koshers meals and redistributed the selections to give each person a variety
to me this seemed very unprofessional and i lost all credibility on the guy
then my friend recommends this place that just opened
he said i should look into modeling
clean rooms and easy access for load inload out
we figured 60 was better than nothing because we could not stay in our home
i was so upset but at the end i found exact tv on amazon for 5779
mahalo rising star staff for making us feel welcome as a family
excellent quality  with out costing a fortune
thank you guys
i love that they creat an environment for the kids such as christmas musical donuts for dads and more
the earliest i could do would be wednesday he told me in a takeit or leaveit manner
so i am going to change this review to 2 stars
i believe this to be a scam
i also rent at extra space around the corner and they provide a jumbo dumpster for customer use
i am a huge germaphobe and my husband knew whatever was lurking in the carpet could keep me from moving in
im not one for techie things but in this instance im nerding out so hard over this media system
imho dr elizabeth welch basically killed my 9year old golden
they exceed my wildest expectations each and every time
we picked a not so popular sheriff callie theme  michelle  her daughter went  made custom decorations
awesome customer care
like i said i have terrible allergies and asthma so i wasnt really sure i would be ok health wise to do spraying every 2 months
again when it is offhours the pool is much better
reasonable prices no over charge
very happy with staff and the system
from the beginning the phone call lily was pleasant and informed me that they would price match when i called
besides that we had some fun with our toddler
in this day and age when people are always trying to get over on people
not once was i greeted
there are a bunch of custom tshirt joints but no tshirt joint delivers and executes such great customer service as the staff here
im pretty sure they saved me from being homeless
they know how to properly clean all fabrics and have amazing attention to detail
paid over 30 for nothing
i told him that i always wore the same bra but in diferent colors
i had a great experience trying out a number of banjos
i was terrified of using a commercial mover as opposed to renting a uhaul and grabbing a couple of laborers worrying that a moving co would hold my things hostage for more money as ive heard theyve been known to do there was nothing like this with these guys
bartender was a busy body and nice as well
so i gave them the file and let them know i needed it the next day
would definitely recommend them
i had visions of horrible damage created by excavations  i need not have worried so much
most packages eventually arrive but its usually a day or two later
24 hour turn around time for appointment set up not 36 or more
i highly recommend you give the pigeon specialist a call and give them a try
the technician luke shows up every 2 months on schedule and then we receive a detailed receipt of the service provided
showed me how everything worked and had it ready for me to pick up later that day
over and over
not only did he save the receipt to show me what the costs were he tolded me if i could find one cheaper he would
another hvac company in the valley had told us this part was unobtainable and the entire system had to be replaced due to this part failing 2 years ago
thank you so much
again i pray for you and those that have to deal with you on a daily basis
i also needed a beautiful stone
i called to inquire about their latest special and to ask how much extra treatment might cost and the old man who answered the phone was incredible rude and ended up hanging up on me
i questioned and doubted
computer doctor bg is highly recommendable
the fix my i phone 5 the use the best part in town all original lcd  jolian is the best technician in town thank you
i called american home shield for more information
he doesnt complain he just laughs and soldiers through
arizona had it in stock and after buying the yelp deal of 20 for 10 it cost me 240
for big families this place is great
they were very professional
the bouquet was right and elviss sash matched my dress
even the last carpet cleaning service id had didnt get out the stains
this place is conveniently located on state street a fitting spot for students who go to uw madison
this is the place to fix your iphone
honestly i thought itd take all day based on how badly i messed my screen up
we promptly called sears and cancelled the order
went to this place which provided a great service  1hr later they fix the screen and replaced the battery for 130
i ordered a mat from them by mistake and was not satisfied with it
it really makes such a huge difference when staff are so genuine and helpful
we were able to zero in on our size and color options with the assistance of a very pleasant and not pushy salesperson
they called as they were able to come in 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time which ended up working great
i was delved in the industry for quite some time and took some time off
not pleased with their service
very excited we headed back to pick them up just 2 hours later
the apple store told me i needed a clean reinstall and i passed this info on
on the day of my duct cleaning  he called me 30 mins prior to my appointment to let me know he was on his way
i also left my dress with her and booked my first fitting for a month out
this is a local owner run business where the cleaning is all done onsite
i wish there was a zero star option
i would never recommend iphone walk in clinic
i utilized the services of mobile notary and i was very satisfied with the service
so i decided test some speakers and try to narrow the selection down
we were overall satisfied with doing business here
i took it to att have insurance they told me to take it to apple
there is a large parking lot right in front of the learning center
first time needed my screen fixed and found them on the internet
update i had my dad because i was working go and try to get the refund that i was promised
american family then said id need to tow it to the dealership to get a key made which would take two days and cost me a couple hundred dollars
paul is very professional
but once they get your phone number they will hound you
early on i saw my daughter progress with each level
loses a star because it is often stuffy and a bit mouldy smelling due to the washing machines being closed before airing out completely but not too shabby overall
my air was coming out cold it was just a flow problem  in my master
aside from the business being run out of a very slovenly home which projected an unprofessional appearance i questioned the qualifications of the tech who over quoted my friend
still living at my front door and was told that traps were 250 more
da mein fahrrad komische gerusche machte ging ich erst mal zu dem fahrradgeschft in dem ich es mir kaufte
the work is second to none and kathy goes above and beyond to deliver
youll feel plenty comfortable wearing a speedo here as it is usually and maybe unusually appreciatedalmost all the ladies are wearing bikinis  stalkers from the outside nonresidents excluding welcomed guests will be dealt with in appropriate measures
well i didnt have the extra 360 at the time so i was at least hoping he would do the service i paid for
my daughter cracked the screen on her iphone so i had to find a place to fix it fast
but he told meit was ok he could take care of everything
yesterday it hit 115 this miserable weather has driven ants charing into our house
i will likely change this review to 5 stars once i have worked more with them
they did all the logo and business hour lettering on the doors and windows
michael is very knowledgeable and professional and was able to help me set up my new 4k tv
so far in the same box ive found bed comforters used to wrap some kitchen items mixed with paintings and a big framed picture that werent wrap in anything all smashed in a box with dusty patio rugs and other items
1we asked that they make sure that her teeth were put back into her mouth before embalming they promised that this would happen
the entire move was great
camelback moving is very cognizant of easilydamaged art i have a lot furniture and unique flooring
oh dear you guys block is just awful
i didnt need it for a few weeks but decided to go ahead and do it as it seemed like a great deal
i said that was fine the gentlemen then informed me lead time was 57 business days also fine
have been in three times now and have never been greeted or offered help or addressed at all by any employees
ive experienced better i cant say that i have   because honestly in terms of apple stores in toronto theres not much
oh my goodnesswith the eye rolling and sighing
so we go and of course thats not what we actually need we actually need like a bill that shows that i live at the delivery address
an hour after this shoddy tech left i received a call from appliance rescue telling me that there was a misunderstanding and that the labor would not be covered
no stars should be allowed
they are always friendly and helpful when i need it but stay away when i dont need the help
this was by far the best experience i have had with moving
they came on tuesday an hour later from what they told me
then she went on to say she doesnt discuss business over the phone
dan informed her of exactly how he would repair the chair showed her another chair that he had just repaired and even gave her a quick tour of the other pieces that he was working on
it wasnt a problem to ask what the services would cost but to my horror i was not expecting the outrageous high pricing that was presented to me
i would and will use mojave again
i worked with the dad and one of his sons and granddaughter
we love our guy tom
the staff is beyond amazing
he told me congrats and some cool information on the design of my ring
i say if you need that odd piece of clothing this place is definitely worth a gander
shane and his team is great
we had oil stains on the floor in our shop walls and even the office carpet and bathroom
id rather take my trash to the dump myself than pay these jerks another penny
one of my incredibly generous and wonderful friends gave me an ipad to use the only problem was that it was cracked and missing the home button
i go around 1030 the next day to get my package line is almost out the door and theres only 2 people working
she gets there early and leaves late 6 days a week
i brought in 13
i needed a very quick turn around on a complex print and cutting job
a million times thank you
after taking the cash and giving me my paid receipt esi complained that he was losing his hourly wage
overall the quote was reasonable and the day of service was scheduled promptly even with our home being far from their normal service area
i just picked up my suits today and i can say it was the best investment i could have made
thanks guys   this review is not hard to write as we are more than happy and we give you a 5 plus
he fixed it within a couple moments and made it work better than before
so i called appliance works monday and a pleasant  accommodating customer service lady answered says they can get someone out in the same day that evening
kim is human like everyone so sometimes a hem or something wont be exact as with any tailor try your clothes on before you leave with them  but what matters is that if something isnt perfect she will do whatever it takes to make it right whether that is fixing it at no charge or even buying you a replacement item of clothing in the rare event that something cant be fixed
turned around and went back to the dealership
i took my phone to get a screen protector installed and they scratched my phone the paint was removed from the button
as for the 3 months they promised to pay they refused
if you think this is a big store then just take a look inside and see for yourself
we will definitely use them again and highly recommend
i highly recommend malcolm and his team for termite and pest control
at every step of our relations it has been exemplary
the staff seems very honest and friendly

its a shame that the delivery service for ontrac wasnt as great as their customer service rep  we will pickup our package before we have ontrac deliver anything else for us
she may be good at what she does but she charges twice as much to do it than the other cleaners in the neighborhood and asks for the money up front before you even get the garment and see the work
i love how they do it right the first time
he missed the time window we had set up
they dont deserve any business
these guys are great
and he enjoyed going there every mwf
bubble wrap etc
thank u
4 every time i asked her a question about why her alterations looked off while i was trying on the dress ie
the reason im still not giving them 5 stars is because wasnt done right from the beginning
was told that he couldnt get it fixed within the 20 min before his quitting time
josh let me borrow his beats
after a quick inspection he confirmed the touch pad was bad
we plan on getting our large sectional done next and possibly our tile
the work crew was very professional
the workers then tell me that they were unable to dry clean it they couldnt tell me why
it also comes with a 10 year warranty
tours start at 10a and leave every 15 minutes till 1130a
dont tell me you can do something go as far as to order the new part and then not give it to me
the tile and grout came out clean beyond my expectations
they come to you and get the job done fast and they are so nice
while i waited for my ring to be sized everyone chatted with me like we were old friends
not only did they not realize they signed a contract with me to make 2 signs they thought there was only one but they signed and agreed to a contract for signs that were rejected by the city of henderson
this place feels like a neighborhood bar with a classic feel
happy to be their client
the went above and beyond by making it perfect
since i was a same day pick up they assurred me a would be the first drop off in the morning great
i highly recommend them
6 folding tables
but the clincher was this less than 3 months later having worn these slacks maybe 10 times the seat completely ripped out in the crotch in two directions leaving frayed fabric
we had a plumbing problem on a saturday morning and called reddi services
after repeated request to come back and remove the rest of the mold i gave up they would not do it
used the yelp coupon and saved 2500
it was a pleasure getting good customer service
we left risen savior after some issues with turnover and poor attention and follow up from staff and pla was a vast improvement
the dimensions were small 2 windows at 20 in x 20 in and 3 at 16 in x 16 in
definitely will come back in the future
both people we worked with were kind and caring
they simply dont care how the shoes look afterwards as long as they get paid and the prices are steep
the owner ed helped us out he was nice and efficient
maybe to get in
dean also pointed out that the electrical box for the pump is never supposed to be mounted on the bottom which is something i had read in the onlineinstallation manual earlier in the morning
i was literally walking by on the way to target next door and decided to at least see what they had
very helpful and friendly staff
took some scrap gold and silver i had laying around to see how much i could get for it
they spray everything and more
they came early the next day and did an amazing job
i will be forever grateful to hervery sweet and reasonably priced
they got me scheduled within a few days and did a fabulous job for a very fair price
to me this is a bait and switch  60 my behind
we have two dogs that seem to gravitate to our bedroom when there is a need to leave a stain
they called me and talked to me pretty much every step of the way to let me know what is going on and sent me pictures of the after product
beim meinem notebook war der grafikkartenchip defekt
adam is fantastic
im happy i found him and will be certain to call him for any future appliance repairs
i call to make sure we are not charged and it is not going to be delivered whenever they decided to

the gentleman said he forgot to order the party and it would be another week to a week and a half
i would never feel safe with any of these people in my home
i scheduled for a tuesday evening appt
the staff was the same staff everyday
when i arrived i was immediately greeted and only waited a short time while the lady i spoke with assisted another guest
before using them the first time i called around a few places for a quote
i love that the staff treat you like family and the coaching is excellent
this is actually one of my favorite post offices because the building is clean and the employees have always been warm helpful and friendly
ive twice mailed something via the usps drop box
she was polite considerate and made my appointment for the same day i called
the dealership wanted 550 for keys and programming labor
b sorry there is no other way to make an appointment except online or in person
i love this place
so on 3316 i signed a withdrawal form advising theyre last day would be 31016 though they never attended the last few days anyway
he tells me i have to call sprint and go through a 45 minute process with someone over the phone to switch the numbers
we recently moved and realized within the first few weeks that we shared the new house with some wasps on the front porch
joe and his staff are fantastic and the store is a great place just to hang out chat with them
i recently had a problem with an hp computer i bought from them warranty was for 1 year but with the manufacture they asked me to allow them to handle the service to contact hp to speed things up they were able to get my laptop repaired through hp within 1 business days for the cost of nothing
after talking he said he could fix the lcd and the cracked glass on my iphone 5 only took about 30 or less minutes and the iphone looks brand new
they did a great job
after getting my pants measured i explained to the guy helping me that i wanted the original hem done and asked if it was possible to get it done sooner since i didnt live in the area they promised 4pm on saturday
i feel that they are genuine in their offers to help and not overly pushy when trying to sell something
in the 4 years ive been having this particular carpet cleaned its cleaner now than it was when i got the key to the house
they always leave a receipt of service with explanations as well
the entire staff is friendly and courteous and they always go the extra mile to make sure that everything is done on time and per instructions
our crew was steve hy marvin and alex
although i did have to go get a deli sandwich afterwards
i got a tattoo for my great grandma i had a birthday card where she wrote i love you more and he put her exact writing on me exactly what i wanted and it turned out perfect
thank you for fixing my iphone
they provide great aid to technology immigrants
little details like that are what make this business stand out
this is my first one star review
they emphasized that theres no guarantee their repair would work but i decided to go ahead with it and it was successful
they took the time to inform me of the entire process  made sure each piece was workable and gave me the confidence to let them perform major surgery on some really valuable and sentimental garments that i thought were goners  but now look like they were bespoke pieces
made an appointment for the next day
i would recommend these guys hands down to anyone needing service or repairs
i love that in a mere 4 hours youre able to help pump out up to 10000 meals for those who dont have access to them
if i ever need the service again im going back to cellz repair
when you close the security door the hinged glass bangs against your inside wood doors gouging the wood and marring the finish

give them a call at 1 480 8374812
i had called the place for three days started by being told they were behind later on added other excuses such as short staff so decided to just show up
complaining did no good
we the watched her walk outside to notice how many tables were still open but she just shrugged off the error and did not offer us a patio table those patio tables remained open for the next 30 mins or so
if you expect to run a successful business being personable is the first step
weve had to fight this through the credit card company and the bbb
checking the tracking number only reveals data entry and no actual movement of the item
i handed her my phone without haste
there seems to be a great selection of other kitchen supplies but i didnt take much time to dilly dally in the store today
he did an amazing job and used a series of brushes and rods in addition to a vacuum to clean out an entire shopvacful of lint and pet hair over 37 feet of vent pipe
its been forever since i received customer service so great i felt the need to contact the manager to compliment them
i cannot count how many times pfennigs has provided excellent customer service had my order ready the day they said it would be and the work was simply perfect
joe did a same day replacement of a garbage disposal for me at a rental property we own
its great having a place around the corner that i can get all my work stuff done at
out in vegas on business staying off the strip
lines are long  and the workers dont even pretend to care
it was somewhat tough to think of all job functions and accomplishments
the touch sensitive part is laminated to the class and the lcd screen so its all one peace connected to the frame
it was tougher than i thought it would be and he pushes you enough to challenge you but not wanting to quit
she was able to find an available unit that was close to the front saved us money on the unit and shared her donut holes     seriously though she was very thoughtful professional and put my daughter and i at ease
he quoted me a great price
my opinionfind another place
ive printed two shirts now with das and couldnt be happier with the results
firstly there were 8 eight people in the house all day
i looked at my jacket outside in the sun as i placed it in my car and i couldnt even see the seam where the waistband had been take in
its still great so they get their 5 stars
robert told us that after a few weeks it would blend to match
it has a ton of variety for all ages
hopefully i dont ever have to repair a cracked screen again but if i do i know who to call
food service was good
ordered the wrong item and failed to deliver my appliances twice
i would recommend the home theater doctor to anyone needing audiovideo work
when we expressed concern about not having microsoft office and that if we had known he couldnt transfer it to our system we probably wouldnt have white washed the computer
sally came out with my jackets ready to go with zippers repaired
i called and got a quote on phone to replace iphone screen
he refused and began arguing with me in the most condescending tone
he didnt act as a salesperson he acted as if he was a dad guiding me with the knowledge i needed to purchasing the right computer
well when i got there i didnt have an appointment so an employee said that it was going to be about 45minutes to an hour which is obviously a long time to wait for a stinking laptop
he was meticulous about details and highly accommodating when we asked for some changes
jerry is very professional and honest
i dont know that i will need another custom shirt in the future but big frog makes me want another custom shirt
its worth traveling to another nearby location
i had an emergency at my rental property when a tenant took a shower on the second floor and water came flooding out downstairs through the ceiling
but no doubt this place has a serious customer service problem
almost everything is marked look for other fabrics in the same pile to see prices if its not labeled
then yesterday i went in for a new project and the two ladies helping me did a great job
i will work with a perfect fit any time i am seeking employment and as a nanny can honestly say if i were to have my own children a perfect fit is the agency i would trust to find the absolute best care for them
ive been taking clothes here for alterations for years and never had a problem
cons the service fee is 95 plus 95 per hour for any work performed
had work done by this company for a yard clean up
last but not least the place really is clean
just a thought
the person at the counter was not friendly continued to eat his sandwich while talking to me and didnt know much about the service his company offered even though most of the information is on their website
vinh gets things done and he is a pretty cool guy
so for the last 9 years my fiance and i have had a box at ups store and what can i say other than impeccable service great leadership great staff and dependable
he asked me for a pick up date and that is when i informed him that i would need everything delivered by august 1 so i asked him what date would be good for pick up to make this happen
problem is no one at pods location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works
if you are open to spontaneous and small art house venues then id say go for it
i have been in the store on countless occasions and jake has always been very helpful and not pushy
wir freuen uns auf jeden fall schon auf das nchste mal und sind schon gespannt welche leckereien die kche uns wieder bietet
even if he couldnt answer my questions it would be nice to have at least an i dont know
never thought i would feel like a fabric store snob but i guess thats me
in short it was a misunderstanding on my part as to the final disposition of the locking device
we spent 23 days in hotels  with a teenager dog and a cat
they are located at decatur  alta make a left on alta and their shop is on the left side past the gas station and in the middle of a little stripmall
great company friendly staff and amazing pricing
my child just finished pre k and can read

the building and things could use some updating
the worst experience i have ever had with a moving company
everyone i spoke with on the phone was pleasant as was the technician
heather was greatif this review was on heather she would get 5 stars unfortunately she works for all sons moving and storage
in that year i took the ps3 back 3 times to get the same issue fixed
one happy customer
they were terribly wrapped and i was also billed for extra time because the movers didnt have the shrink wrap on them they had to go get it
thank you robert
6 3200 worth of my itemized items were not delivered
since we now know that he is not a man of his word we would not give him our business or recommend him to any of our friends or family
i decided to ease off and hit the steam room which lets face it is the real reason i go to the y well this one and harris at least
he is very knowledgeable and thorough
i eventually went back with it as well as bringing another garment leaning on the side of building trust
we have had this service for about two years and our pest problem was taken care of

id have to disagree with others comments about bad service almost any rideattraction i brought my kids to had an attendant on hand ready to accept tickets
oh my goodness i got the very best service here
i explained the situation an the size of the house an he said it wouldnt be a problem
i think the only good thing with them is installation
i have used sportswear express for over 10 years with my 2 businesses
thought we were going to have to do a stakeout  paid him the fee and didnt have to do it
there are always good deals here
make a reservation to whitewater
the place is kinda small for all the services they offer like printing office supplies etc
they even got here earlier than they said they would
i will definitely be using them again for any future repairs
talked with the owner to try and get some assurance that the work would be completed
two and a half months later were finally closed
they declined a replacement stating only electronic pieces are covered under warranty
he was great
not even a week after he fixed my phone the screen went haywire
we couldnt bring friends in it because it was so gross
the office is up a narrow flight of creepy stairs and it is sparsely furnished except for the consultation office
even if they send me a box of flaming dog excrement theyll have done it with way more class style and responsiveness than the others in town
its only a 500 dollar payment for some gear and a registration fee then the payment is going up monthly but you can come a little extra
i stored my daughters college stuff in one of there units over the summer
ill definitely be back again

terrible customer service dishonest employees
i usually have them spray the inside as well as the outside twice a year and that is included in my monthly price

ill certainly keep using them

air pro crocks
i see a sale associate standing in front of the drum section i make eye contact with him and give him a gesture to let him know i mean business
the food is above average and there are plenty of morning breakfast options too
however the food is mediocre and expensive
cant wait for our next trade show when i can show them off
will come back and recommend this place for everyone i know
on the bright side i was able to go back to the store and pick up the 2014 overdrive sport not the bike i ordered even though i had ordered the crappier bike in the picture
the blue suede shoes had a tear in the toe of one and the black wedge boots had worn out heel bottoms that needed replaced
worst place ever
the prices are pretty steep to use the good machines and the driers take at least two cycles to dry anything
hes all about getting the job done right and not about speed or shortcuts
and compared prices and quality between all the companies i spoke with
good luck in the future matt but i wont be calling or recommending your company to anyone
he took great care to reach out andor follow up with me to make sure i had all of my questions answered and to brief me on where the order stood

we were greeted right away and given a tour of the facility

they use non toxic chemicals which is very important to me

he also did it all very quickly and for a very reasonable price
creasing on point
i think most dry cleaners offer tailoring services if you want your good clothes to look perfect you should take the time to find somebody reputable and make the investment in a proper hemming job
its cool to be able to go to a store and have the guys that work there know what you like and know about the products
very friendly staff
his response was aluminum or steel
great service and the people are nice
i would not give this store a full 5 star rating because the store is always crowded which is good for business but it is mostly young kids playing on the computers and getting in the way
thats pretty great customer service in my opinion
ill save it for the review on their store on their yelp page soon
we moved on friday colin  james did a great job the price was good and they took good care of out belongings

this was a nice experience and i feel i made a good choice

tommy is able to answer questions he is thorough very very kind and thoughtful
probably not the cheapest but after several months of struggling with a problem left by the previous company i had used brian and cody solved the problem quickly once and for all
i must say he is highly skilled in his craft able to diagnose the issue in a matter of few minutes his sincere and his fees were super reasonable
this review is long and thorough but the reasoning behind my review will become very evident as you read
he did the repair in about 25 minutes and it was done perfectly
they were completely uneven
he had my ring out within a few hours so i didnt even have to go a day without it
rob was very friendly and answered my questions about different stains on my carpet
if i would have known that their tolerance level for the products is so low standard i would have never ordered any products with them
he then gave me a credit which i knew i shoulda took the money and ran because then
this review wouldve gotten a full 5 if the guy working on our garage door showed up on time

we were very satisfied with our service from david who did everything he could to make sure the ticks were dead and gone and that we could be comfortable in our home again as soon as possible

i get off the phone with her i call amazon i explain the need to change the address and they conference call in a representative from ontrac who confirmed that the new address and that they would deliver to my office and not my home
however they do not think my existing extra carpet is clean enough they concerned the result might not be perfect

i do not have the concern a bit with tim
super impressed and pleased to wear much newer looking shoes to work now
i complained nothing was done
they worked quickly never took a break
the watch batteries were fairly inexpensive about 10 each but the watch band was higher priced to similar ones found at discount jewelry stores
dont use them
every step of the way they somehow managed to be both professional and personal
and theyll make sure your bill is due on an odd day so there no way you can remember to pay it

instead i reached out to him to install a swamp cooler in a window in a garage

lydia in particular has been cleaning my home since the beginning and knows which areas of my home tend to need extra tlc
when i got home and tried them on i realized that they only did one leg
she is worth probably four times what she charges
who does thatjust moves your appt whether its convenient or not
lo and behold this store tried to charge me double
i am unsure how it takes nearly an hour per customer when they are buying something but it seems to be quite the lengthy process  and not even to switch companies
the finished product was beautiful and they cleaned up after themselves well too
i have to say sometimes my uniform have off track military creases but most of the time is clean pressed and sharp
gross get a cleaning lady to detox the place and have one come at least monthly
they were locally owned and had great service
good work assistant
i highly recommend urban desert for anyone looking to get there home sprayed and pest free
the owners and directors are the most wonderful communicators
i might have the worst luck ever when trying to find a good dry cleaners
i was going to go through groupon but the places i was calling were either booked out for weeks didnt answercall back or wanted to charge a much higher amount on top of the groupon when i mentioned it was for a move out clean
do not use this service
if i hadnt called ahead and spoken to an absolute boob before i got there id probably give them a 4star rating minus one star because for chrissakes their boxes are overpriced
all my clothes comes out great
the instructor was very kind and knowledgable
the water store is where i get our alkaline water for 150 a gallon
i had to run to bed bath and beyond for something and looked in their organizing section
my computers operating system was destroyed by an internet virus
not only that but her attitude tone and words were absolutely horrible
we werent asked how our day was if anyone helped us or anything other then hi and how are you paying

update after more than 6 months i returned to the store
with the 10 year warranty i wont have to worry about it for a long time
when i contacted appliance repair phoenix i knew i would receive quality service

i have to say the new automation is my favorite because now i can be out having dinner with my wife at a restaurant and i can use my iphone to start heating up the hot tub so its ready by the time we get home
the canopy walk itself is not big it was actually smaller than i expected it to be but kids will love it
i was very happy with the results and i would recommend them to anyone
worst service ever
i will trying a different dry cleaner in the future
service was very prompt the dress required only 3 days to repair and the quality was topnotch the zipper was a good brand and even sturdier than the original one that broke
stop in for service and was not charged a cent
they offer design services and go above and beyond to make sure the client is happy
great customer service
i think when it comes to something like housecleaning many people have different expectations and preferences
needless to say amazing customer service the manager william was beyond helpful friendly and professional
she also suggested other dresses that i would not have tried on my own
she even had the audacity to tell me a week before my wedding that she does not have time to work on the sleeves
first time using professional carpet cleaners and decided to go with turbo carpet cleaners base on high customer reviews
the repairman was prompt and courteous
he also very nicely gave me a couple of booties to use while i was still needing to move some items out of the house so i didnt get the carpet dirty
so no its friday after 530 and i can expect a phone call monday sometime about the cost of the board
my clothes were soft and clean and all my collars had new stays
i would highly recommend her
i called vellve systems and they transferred me to their network administrator jim the moment i started explaining my situation  he knew exactly what i was talking about
knowledgeable and patient i give them 5 stars all around
because it july 3rd
i showed him the spot that was obviously still there and he replied oh do you have a cat
downside is the pricing of items
thought  i was going to have a problem to have a large amount of collateral in cash returned
paul is the bestbo a close second
day of the move i received a polite call from one of the two movers letting me know they were stuck in traffic
my z10 had a camera problem no water this time and it was fixed within the day
thinking about doing my wheels next
she was efficient and got my two watches done in under 10 minutes as she promised although i cant say if they can maintain that speedefficiency when there are more customers and for a great price too 5watch
express ground package supplies available packing services fedex return system location accepts cash saturday service  and sonypicture station direct mail services
i wouldnt do any business with them that required future delivery
they saved my skin before a trade show and printed beautiful brochures in a couple hours and waited after closing for me to pick them up not only that  they did so at less than half of what fedex kinkos charges and knew exactly how to do the job without prompting unlike kinkos
worst customer service ever
even the other review says they are still working on the problem
thank you chmj
pikolo myriade humble lion odessa dispatch have a new competition
after my name was put in the query i proceeded to wait for about 1015 for a simple return
because of employee lack of communication
ive been going here for years
and if youre lucky  you might get to meet and pet their friendly dog
so called manager  jabar and salesperson avery not customer friendly
after waiting for an associate to help me for over 30 min and asking when i would be helped twice
they cleaned things i wouldnt even think of looking behind
after getting back my printed items i handed the woman 50 cents as my 4 black and white prints came to 45 cents
they show  it online but you drive to the nearest center and  they dont have it im a professional musician and sometimes get caught in situation where i need something now even though i carry backup
the setup of the store is a bit cluttered
and i save 40
the staff were extremely professional and friendly and the suit choice was very impressive as was the service
on top of that the portions were huge
these guys are totally unreliable and it would serve everyone better if they go bankrupt
i am here to add yet another 5star rating to their name
our cars were loaded with stuff and our moving truck was arriving 2 days later so we were in a bind to find a cleaning service asap
he also installed and set up a new digital thermostat that i had purchased
the inside of the church is really neat and colorful
after posting my previous review greg from the company personally reached out to me to make the situation better
i feel like i got a quality product at a fair pricewith a warrantyand i would definitely recommend this store
it just made some awful loud whirring and clicking noises
it cost me 50 to repaire and shine they lasted 2 days
both turned out fantastic and most of all wearable in public
what else can i say
an die falsche adresse
thank you magic tailor for taking the stress out of alterations
while the move went just fine i did not expect to be sexually harassed by one of the men i was paying to help me move
mike and his brother john did an amazing job
found a new mattress here that was the style and brand that i wanted stearns and foster
i hand her a 10 bill
the gold foil printing on the front has received many compliments
he calmly and professionally took care of all issues
fast  honest service every penny was worth it
hands down the best professional cleaning service i have experienced
i dont know about other people but im not especially excited by these kinds of places so i will just say reasonable opening hoursprice and a good job done with my clothes
an older gentleman didnt catch his name acknowledged that he was the one that spoke with me
next up will be a zipper in my sons boots
do not use this company
like the others say my company in long beach ca received a bill for 70 for services that we never signed up for
after checking in the guy they schedule me w for my appointment was already w someone
no price gouging here
im rating this as a two due to an annoying practice i find this business has had a practice recently that seems to be growing
my first appointment i came in with natural short nailsvery short
i called lv mobile bike repair for an estimate prices seemed fair so i made a same day appointment
now for the bad  the food was beyond terrible
he worked with us on different options for the laminate as well as the tile
amazing friendly and speedy customer service
they repair and sell computers also
as i was driving down scottsdale road i looked up some reviews on yelp for an honest  reliable heatingac
i ended up spending more than twice as much on getting the zipper fixed as i did on the dress in the first place
apply really puts a great focus on customer experience excellence
seriously as youre reading this review you should just go ahead and call this company
ich hatte ein wunderschnes altes aber in die jahre gekommenes barocksofa geerbt
but this is about apple yorkdale not the whole company
called this morning came out this afternoon
dropped my iphone 6 and shattered the screen completely  found this place on groupon and so glad i did
we called this company easter weekend now i wish we didnt
i plan to bring my mom in the future as well since im sure shell adore it and is already a big fan of the book this is named after
hell hath no fury like a yelper scorned
they barely have any customer but took almost 2 hours to just changed some infos and buy new iphone 5c
i love this place
we have found many many fabrics here
when we finally found the house in june 2015 we chose to buy
highly recommend they seem like genuinely good people
its kind of on a oneway street so access is limited
i definitely recommend them if you need your carpets or couches cleaned
i took my computer in to sparkys and told them that it was running slow could they make it run faster
he takes pride in his work and is very professional and courteous
i would highly recommend this company to those interested in having work done
if not stay away
yolanda was a great help and has great customer service
i know hes in great hands and his teachers genuinely care about the kids and their learning experience
i took some suits in to get alterations done today
even after we picked them up and everything was good again they provided additional support to fix some very minor issues and explain a few other things related to the repairs at no additional cost
if i ever need my phone fixed again this is where ill go
i decided this was a viable solution for the 2nd problem and my pocketbook so he repaired the first problem
it was a huge relief for us how dependable and professional the service was especially given our busy schedule
i went to countless jewelers over the past year trying to find someone to fix my watch
another advantage is the 140kmh speeds
best haircut ever
i had bad experience with these guys
its annoying that they bounce between people and keep you waiting
ata provides you with a handbook and step by step instructions to get out the right way
then a couple of years ago for my birthday i received a box of business cards in the mail from my cousin dru
once you get in things go quick and easy
this is too awesome to be true
ive had comforters cleaned for 15 not bad and yesterday dropped off two pairs of pants one of which needed the hems on both legs sewn for a grand total of 11
he was fairly helpful
soim back here this morning i walk in  isabel acts like shes never seen me before
i have all my service work done here and these guys are top notch
my daughter had her heart set on this dress from etsy for prom
in late 2011 i bought a helmut
i would highly recommend
they looked around the house to make sure that they are not someplace else
best cleaners in town
thank you guys
glad i called absolute appliance instead
next day comes i dont hear from him i text him he tells me that he hasnt looked at it but that i can call this other number
we saw the garbage truck drive by and immediately we thought if they dont care enough to keep track of our dogs belongings they might be in the trash
i called another company who sealed up my house immediately and uses different methods so nothing dies and decays in my house
not only is it clean and wellkept the customer service is beyond phenomenal
at the end of the day i would ask the adult in charge how my kids were that day and most times the answer was i dont know
die hauptpltze sind der jacquescartier platz place darmes die rue paul rue notre dame bis hin zum flussufer des st lorenz strom mit dem alten hafen
rebecca is wonderful
this place is just a sad excuse for a company
the customer service supervisor was abrupt ambiguous rude and took all of 20 seconds to deny the claim
when my husband got home that night he couldnt even find where the repair had been made
good laundry spot
oh did i mention they are quite pricey
furthermore quotes seemed heavily padded promised services were later reneged work came back less than perfect and overall i really wish i had gone elsewhere
i went to get a couple of pairs of boots reheeled
do yourself a favor any and all issues for this post office needs to be filed using the form on this website
they were very quick loading and unloading the moving truck damon asked numerous times where i would like things placed and was so easygoing and insured that all of my furniture clothes books kitchenware was placed with care
soap and tp too just like uptown
it took just over an hour and he was done repairing my phone for about 120 was essentially replacing the screen
the machines dont work the soap dispensers dont work its a joke
its people like heather that make this shopping experience worth while
from the owner who personally came to the house to provide the estimate to the painter who did the worktop notch
this place is awesome
a manager was very accommodating in letting me put it in hold through saturday at the sale price
apo the quote i was given was for usps not ups at 107
laundry in my building broke and id been putting this off for a few weeks
was able to get an appt on saturday just a could of days laterge had no saturday appts until the next month
totally recommend this company definitely going to choose them again
took my car to get my roof wrapped
she even added a better hidden zipper to my dress to add to the altered perfection this dress was a head to toe alteration sizing down from extra large to medium
i believe most if not all of the items are american apparelsourced but made even more special with that signature hardboiled cutesiness
not happy about that
theyve helped me save a handful of expensive jeans that i found in the vintage stores and alter them for my body
the gym itself is nice but it only has 4 usable trx bands it seems
they tell me the only guy working the parts dept is off for lunch and will be back in 45 minutes
a few hours ago i discovered that my screen is messed up
she is very good with details even small details i would not have noticed she took notice to that made my dress fit even better
it took 15 minutes and was very easy to use
but there was a disconnected wire one of five in a junction box so highly unlikely that it became disconnected on its own
davids prices are extremely fair he comes to your location and is an all around nice guy

anyway we emailed back and forth for a week or so he got me approved for the trek credit card and finally i came in to test a few out
nick and pro restoration really went over and above in meeting customer needs
their response maybe the kid was crying because he wanted the teddy bear  later i come to find that the teacher had put her two weeks in  had this behavioral issue and valley child care let her finish her two weeks
well if they cant provide good customer service then maybe they should close until they can
i wouldve stayed in california until everything was lined up properly if i wouldve known
he has been running me around in circles for going on 3 months now
i hate moving but i think i got lucky from the beginning of the call they were nice  and friendly  managed to be in time and get it done  the guys were professional  and nothing much to report  it was from las vegas to califonia  thanks guys  yes i know  some times people have issues  this one was wonderfull and smooth
the curriculum is solid the healthy meals and snacks included in tuition is a huge help and the teachers care for our children
they should have provided me with a partial refund at the very least as i essentially paid them for nothing my coat looks exactly the same
they have computers behind the counter great prices with some kind of guarantee
a better day pigeon control keeps its word
brian grilling a few potatoes in the stove comes over and give me a hand with the frame and tire with only a glance and a question
it feels so empowering to be in a custom suit tailored by this wonderful local business
train these people to work well teach them customer service simply smile once in a while
they told me it was not recoverable but offered me 50 for parts
the technician was very nice and seemed very knowledgeable
aside from the altruistic reasons which are great the food is delicious
i ordered their pre and post emergent weed service a few weeks ago and after about a week i noticed the weeds were not dying like they should
i had no more information from anyone one week trying to talk with the insurance and i did not have any feedback despite my hours and hours waiting on the line without an answer
they charged 1000hr for the tiny tots which is pretty reasonable
but then we were at the orleans one day and found out that they had a day care center where you could drop your kids off for a maximum of 5 hours for a nominal fee
since our tech sprayed around our house i havent seen a single bug
speak english and spanish
these guys are awesome
ive worked with elaine and paul for a few years now
i have a white sectional that had a very specific cleaning method recommended by the manufacturer
this is a scam
i am absolutely not comfortable in stores that sell electronics
the worst service alive
location right across the busy us post office but less lines to worry about
great advice smooth processing and friendly staff
my name is everything to me and if im going to refer somebody theyve got to be the best because all my customers will remember is me when they get that sour taste in their mouth from a poor referral
came in looking for a extra battery for my note 4 and amanda was more than happy to help
i feel safe going there any time day or night but i usually go during the day so i can say hi to michael or jamie
in fact i have provided generous documentation that proves temperature differentials are inconclusive indicators of a more serious problem
both mike and brett were a pleasure and i highly recommend their service
next problem was with a worker in the store just overlooking me after waiting 30 mins to get service
i wanted  a particular bike rack so he ordered me one and lent me his off his own car till my came in
because of my last visit id be hesitant to visit them again
theres a good reason for that
maybe its a hit or miss
they are quick efficient and easy to work with
i decided to look into a used mac
my husband and i went there and brought one of the cushions with us
when i was down  out and couldnt get thanksgiving dinner  they were handing out complete dinners from turkey to pumpkin pie and evrything in between
they just didnt seem to care
i filled out a form  they had a check for me the very next day
scent from above is my goto cleaning crew
my plan was to make the best of a bad situation and just ride out the contract
ive recommended him numerous times and will continue to do so
why would you knock assuming he did at all and if no one is home leave a package in an unsecure and open location where it is free to be taken
this isnt an inconvenience its just bad business
i cant thank you enjoy
hint let kids wear costume and they can trick or treat at stations
the person in the process of spending money should be serviced as quickly as possible
asking a staff member here where this item is located is about as useful as looking online
he noticed the hose was pulling up kitty litter and asked to see my vacuum
why had he told me there was a small mechanical issue when there was actually a fire
looked as though ducts had never been cleaned
i fully believe everyone should have a cobbler on hand and this place is mine
if they are that pushy i can pay for someone elses machines
paid 70 dollars for absolutely nothing
the only complaint i have was that the computer interface was complicated and the right phone numbers are hard to find
im very disappointed and i gave him several opportunties to make the situation right
if you have something in need of repair i would give them a try
it shows him you really took the time to find quality electronic care
they didnt even call me
ive spent the last 2 nights relaxing in my new hot tub and being thankful for cdc pools
i bought a new phone but my son has been asking to use my old 5 i popped in to ubreakifix at 510 this afternoon to see if there was anything they could do
the deep cleaning that i paid an extra 15 bucks for is them running a plastic brush through your carpet
also make sure you know its suite 15 there is no marquee  with the business name on it
i might get it dry cleaned next time to see if theres a major difference it would be an extra 7 to do so
thank you guys for being so wonderful and talented
im no plumber but it doesnt take an expert to know when youve been taken
my move was only large furniture as we were moving all the smaller items and boxes ourselves
christopher was great
our water heater gave up the ghost last night
jim is fantastic
he asked briefly for what was wrong and i tried to explain but honestly i dont know whats wrong
then i noticed the next day this new screen he installed had a dead pixel also and the edges of my screen were yellowinggreen at times
another recent growing issue he needs to address is the use of cell phones during haircuts its not productive and really unprofessional
when its not busy customers shouldnt have to ask for refills on water
i asked him why he did not tell me sooner instead of telling me st 435pm when all places were closed
wish they were in seattle too
staff is super friendly too
if they try to produce ashes and a paw print it will be completely false and not our dog
george really takes the time to explain his process to you and make sure all your questions are answered
it just happened to be when the iphone 6 released terrible timing on my part
so is the customer service

well all of the yelp reviews are spot on
love the quality of the cleaning
highly recommend this place
we also saw a lot of bees hovering around our sprinkler heads after they had recently run
we have been using progressive pest control for over 3 years now and we have no complaints
the next day he attempted to call both my fiance and me
i do wish they gave you an itemized receipt when you drop off clothing instead of just a stub with a number for times like that
lock my keys in my car recently  just before about to leave vegas to la i was rushing
obviously love what they do and the tele plays awesome
i put on my best momface  and pulled that beast of a stroller out of storage awkwardly heaved its huge heavy ass into the tiny trunk of my car and desperately rolled it into sun cyclery
she brought another lady out named kelly solaegui who was disappointingly enough the headmaster of the school
nice couple running small business
she was very accommodating on doing it when i needed because i waited until the last minute
my graphics are always professionally done and delivered at breakneck speed
he passed down the unfortunate verdict that my hd was deceased and needed to be replaced and that nothing else seemed wrong with my powerbook
t is a beautiful area filled with history that makes for a nice stroll anytime of the year and i cant recommend it enough just for its beauty
they are very professional
his quote was spot on when he completed the cleaning
i lived in a two story house with a roommate and a dog and the mess that has generated throughout time had progressed
please read madeline was super persistent and sold me
stay far far away from this company and if youve already been suckered in then make sure you keep a very detailed log of what has taken place with them
on 5122012 she was at the storage unit removing the last of her few boxes and the washerdryer was still there
he recommended a very budget friendly tire that would suit my needs
hot summer days and the coldest of winter i would be stuck in that horrible section of not only cleveland but the earth
the turnaround time was lightning fast and i cant imagine going anywhere else
what all the other reviews are saying is true
for example baguettes typically cast a greyish shadow simply because of how theyre cut
auctions systems does not police their consignors and the rip offs are rampant
extremely fast and super friendly
definitely will come back again
their tile cleaning also left a sticky white haze on the tile and grout
top notch place
the fan blades were dusted however the housing unit was not
and was very professional and friendly throughout his time in our home
this year they will build upon all of that and take her further
i think thats pretty coincidental
the pesky ants are no more
attention to detail polite professional thats 5 stars every time
hard to find as very little signage but that is only a detail
it says a lot for someone who actually knows what they are doing
seems like a popular place in a good location
guess what when my wife and i checked the nanny out
the employees only transfer me to other employees and its going in circles disgusted never again
very quickly he was writing his numbers and letters learning the continents and states and even reading very easy phonetic books
i have already recommended her to others

this is the worst cleaning service ever
i appreciated apple for making the exchange when they didnt have to well done
i said i was not going to do that and they had to redeliver which he agreed to
i left the store feeling reassured that my dress would be perfection thats the vibe mark gives
i was first attracted to carpet green clean do to the fact that they use all organic products and i can say for the price i am happy with the service after a few companies told me my grout cleaning would be upwards of 750 for 600 square feet
the team is amazing and very helpful the final product came out perfect
i have to say this the is most friendliest and efficient service ive had in a while
frequently use same day service when i realize an event is coming up and i forgot to take the drycleaning
for my daughter she  prices are extremely competitive and i will be coming here for all of my alterations and would love to create more of custom outfits with you ladies
i would suggest getting a tour from a staff member when you sign up although they usually do that anyway
i cannot however speak for their drycleaning business

clean well organized and they even provide a padded changing station with diaper genie and hand sanitizer
i was so upset
what the bad service man
on monday it is out for delivery at 730 am and i have been waiting till 7pm and it is still not delivered
they drove through the night from la in thunderstorms two cats that wouldnt shut up and little sleep to make it to their new apartment by 630am so they could avoid some of the desert heat
also my closing on my house was delayed 3 times and so this move got changed with short notice
i like the vibe here and the folks are super cool
they have a very stinky smell and never have soap in the dispensers
i dropped my iphone 6 in soup soup is hazardous
no wonder there is no pricing listed online
the problem came when they went to reinstall my front door

thank you dave 72715 that was my review before they relocated to downtown summerlin
i called critter tech again and now their suggestion is to pay another 250 to do a smoke test to see if the rats are coming in through the sewerplumbing

and the decoration in the shop is also very snazzy
overall the customer service when i picked up the truck was great
they were punctual and did excellent work in a timely manner
i dont know why im writing this review because im sure usps wont do anything about the problem
luckily it almost buffed out
oh man did he spray
will absolutely use and refer this company moving forward
she pointed me right into a room without asking me any questions or greeting me
let me just start by saying that i do not leave reviews often but this company just compelled me to warn others to stay away and not even because of the services but because of their complete lack of professionalism and empathy

laundered shirts are less than 2 each
we loved the selection of kitschy stuff available in the gift shop and bought a pair of toasting flutes and an elvis tree ornament
a fun store wish i lived closer
the staff was great and i loved the way the teachers interacted with the children
the foot massage was the best part
its always a pleasure when technicians show up on time complete the work on time and have great customer service skills
she was happy to do this simply allocating the 85 dollars for the bra to the bustle that miraculously went up in price by exactly 85
was told it needs to be deep cleaned for 600
i am a teacher and know the importance to creating a positive first impression when it comes to school
i would not take them anyplace else
never calls back and only one email after many and claim that they do not want take any responsibly and i am all i was asking for anything but just give me 50 of the washer price
i tried this place for the first time this week
updated review the owner of the company came to our appointment today
they wont be able to get good wellpaying jobs but they sure will have the privilege of getting to say that they paid 5060 a month to go to a less than mediocre gym
best cobbler in north america
not only did casey the owner take great care of my drop off but he even helped me move everything to my car
my carpets look brand new
not only did they have incredible cuts of meat they also have beans
she was very sweet and on top of the blanket distribution  theyre not kidding when they say to dress warm
we were told wed have 2 guys and to our surprise they sent 3 at no extra charge
also she does not have her hours on her answering machine which was also a bit of an inconvenience when trying to find a time my husband could return to have the pants fixed in light of his work schedule
im glad i did not do business with them
the lady who works there during the day is very helpful and organized which is always a plus at a dry cleaners
before  they seemed to have some little overpriced items  for a non profit store i would think prices will fair  but lately  i had seen a change on that matter
atkins  honored the sales price of a local competitor which i appreciated
she gets it perfect the first time
her prices are more than fair
also the place gets picked over like crazy on the weekends and the home section is sparse to say the least
2 my suit coat came back ruined
i contacted groupon to refund me my money and called abraham the owner who had still not called me back to let him know we would no longer be needing his services
great customer service air conditioned units friendly atmosphere it just cant be beat
they have been so helpful to us in many ways
the crazy thing is its not just one person its the whole team
which i  appreciate his honesty
im very excited for the location at the arrowhead town center to open
i dropped off 8 pieces on saturday and they were ready for pick up on monday morning
do they stand behind their quality
so my partner and i hopped into the other store
bam new one for free
i needed the part right away so i bought it at a notsodiscounted price
i have found my experience with n scottsdale less than what i have received at the chandler and santan village stores
i have moved over a 7 times here in las vegas and these guys were terrific
he suggested again that it needed service by a spa technician
i couldnt get ahold of anyone yesterday the 4th of july
so dont even bother
its also a fine place to bring your work as it is normally quiet and there is free wifi
tech support was rude
but someone in the ups warehouse poked several non accidental holes in my bed box to look inside when it was waiting for me to pick up at their warehouse for a day which i will personally yell at them for that
finde es super wie freundlich die leute sind
i met with her yesterday and got my license plates in 1 day
but thats another yelp back to sprint we did feel like we got our questions answered and they didnt seem all that bad
i highly recommend banner plus to anyone looking to get decals done
i cant believe how great they look and how fast and efficient the guys were
good prices on most things here
rebuilders is right
then proceeds to tell me that the phone has been submerged
upfront and honest
company is only good if they are wanting you to post a good review
i recently purchased a new windows 10 laptop and needed the data from my old laptop transferred
their entire concept is to make getting a ticket simpler
how am i supposed to maintain clean carpets when wet carpet attracts more dirt
theres another dry cleaner literally walking distance but i saw negative reviews on rudeness and thats one thing i dont stand for
this place is especially for you if you are a creative remodeler and enjoy antiques
then they turn around and charge 10x the adoption price as county
they did a wonderful job last time and did it again this time
ok everyone i went in today 100714 at 2pm not knowing what to expect at all from this placesince its reviews were horrible and to my surprise the two gentlemen working were friendly
attendant very nice
you can even pay in most areas of the store where you find your items
one of the pins was bent
think twice before considering a bad experience at howard  blum fine jewelers
a special thanks to rene q larry p and darrell r the staff is courteousness and professional
sadly the last two times ive sent laundry there its come back unsatisfactory
came out same day took 30 min to fix ac and the tech was very pleasant
he was able to diagnose and repair some longstanding problems and perform some upgrades to the caps that had been recommended by serious audiophiles for a while
they are more likely to drop your call than answer it and the cabs are are dirty inside
communication was good and vehicle was repaired and delivered on time
i tried on my clothes for about twenty minutes with the tailor both when i dropped off and when i picked up
i have noticed though that if i visit too frequently like within 2 weeks i will often see the same things again the second time im there
ive since decided to go to another shop from now on
i was looking for a new dry cleaner so i gave polo cleaners a shot based on the positive reviews
prices are what you would expect and the only partial negative is that i dont think they run a ton of specials
i would avoid going here if you can
we then realized that we had to watch over the technician the whole time
most of the machines did not work
numerous calls have been made with an excuse everytime
he still had much more to offer as his sms showed to me
they were professional very courteous and done on time with their original quote
i switched technicians a couple of months ago and dalton has been efficient on time friendly and communicative about whats going on around my house
when i decided it was time to pop the question i chose to skip the big name retailers and decided to give my old friend ryan at the jewelry replacement source a call
it was a birthday party for a friends son who turned one year old over the weekend
i understand it can be kind of intimidating to talk to the staff
our order was processed quickly and accurately for the shot show convention with a minimum of extra effort from me
marshall had complained about in writing
highly recommend using this small company for individual or large jobs
my daughter needed hers repaired and i searched everywhere to reach someone
theres also a nice area outside with exhibits and the tortoise habitat
i always find that their experience helps me in making the right decision in regards to the layout color and price that always leaves me excited about my promotional items
they were able to restore my water damaged phone in a timely manner with a fair price point
fourth although the boxes were clearly marked with the rooms they were to land in the markings meant very little as i found kitchen boxes upstairs in the master and willynilly random boxes just piled one on top of the other in the garage
this time was no exception
this is a great business ran by a true combat vet and theyre conveniently located and customer serviceoriented
clay took extra care to do a great job and he was quick and courteous
after determining a new water heater was needed replacement was scheduled for the very next day
so we get to the new apartment and me and my friend were beyond starving we told them where we wanted everything m went to go grab a bite to eat which took us about 20 minutes
my worry is that the band wont last very long due to weather conditions and my inability to remember to remove the lightsor worse that theyll get stolen
i picked it up the next day fixed and paid less then quoted
so the lesson to be learned here people is that just because a company is endorsed  by famous celebrities this does not mean that its the best company out there
in short i wouldnt hesitate hiring brimleys for your carpet or tile cleaning
i invited him out to complete the install and he was incredibly thorough and stayed until we had a chance to test everything
and twice now this company has failed to deliver the product to the correct address
the next morning we jumped up and decided to go to best buy
and i noticed that the screen film was removed so i asked where did it go
cut the heat out by more than half
i only wish there were a way to give 0 stars
showed up at 730am and had my garage cleared of renovation debris in 15 mins
zuvor wurden wir immer ausfhrlich beraten
add beverage service and its even better
