any explanation of the dishes here would not be enough just go and try it for yourself
the passion iced tea is so refreshing and it came with unlimited refills
mmmm soo good i go all the time to get the pineapple fried rice and its great
much to my surprise it was a full fledged restaurant with a great view of the strip and the fountain show at the bellagio
my dad picked out this place to go to dinner when he was in town this weekend
lightly dressed and a large enough portion that i had leftovers
what a horrible experience
now that they have all gone home i gave it a try
however once we found the entrance we were relieve to find a cute comforting restaurant
a few places were open but looked really sketchy
the finale with the performers walking down the birthday cake silver stairs with their jeweled colored costumes was so colorful and fantastical
dont get it if you want a traditional margarita my friend got one and tearing up as he choked it down
its a vegas tradition you cant really say youve been to vegas unless youve tried fat tuesday or purchased the unnecessary big alcoholic slushie beverage
let me tell you why marquee is a moneyhungry genius
protein prime rib beef bread sourdough sauces horse radish  black truffle dip the putting together part isnt as fun as it sounds but i guess i understand their thought process behind it
with the exception of the halibut i ordered
he thought it was  boring nothing special and overpriced
i asked for the bartender to order me a drink based on my meal and preferences and his selection was perfect  food was great rabbit pasta with aged parmesan that was excellent
i worked there as a karaoke dj for 6 months
i dont spend as much time in kensington market as i used to but ive always liked this place as the general vibe is chill but approachable
they dont do housebrewed
i had the turkey burger and it was better than most i have had at restaurants but still not as good as the one my husband makes at home
we also had the blue cheese home made potato chips
if its too hot theyll turn on the mist system
you cant go wrong at yard house
only try melt when you are really hungry hungover or just in need of a ton of food
fried chicken looks undercooked and skin is a bit slimy but i was explained that its brined for 24 hours and cooked sous vide for 2 hours and always served a little pink
the beer was delicious get the one that resembles blue moon
the bbq sandwich and fried catfish dinner was also very good
not as bad as a clubbut imagine a packed bar with lots of loud conversation
overall great spot
only 3 stars due to the servicewas not impressedserver was a bit slow and unattentive only came by when she had to and a bit too late
the food and drink prices are super cheap
very clean and inviting decor
if its an hour before sunset dont sit at the tables next to the glass wall where the sun shines in
the first time was when they first opened
the food is excellent
not a good value for the money my buddy and i dropped 200 on dinner
this place is  literally aok   though id rather avoid going to places that make me feel like a cow when i walk out they do have some awesome deals
thank you comedy bar for removing this underwhelming version of a dish that should be difficult to fuck up from your menu
the three of us in my group ordered pasta i got the rigatoni with meat sauce and it was perfect
but the hakassan people overbooked tables that night so we ended up not getting a table after an hour wait
i spend a few nights a week in old town and will always end up at the mint
bar staff did a great job taking orders considering how busy and loud the place got as the evening went on
highly suggested and will definitely go back when in vegas
nothing really appeals to me anyway
we ordered the lobster roll and the gumbo
we walked up to tao beach and that was really nice too they played music there and it was outdoors right by the pool so we chilled there for a bit to get fresh air
no mass production here
it is easy to miss
from the moment i walked in i was escorted on a whirlwind by brittany our lovely hostess
im here again for prime rib night
yes i said it
location is still the best part
plus the thousand island tastes like you took a bite of miracle whip and called it dressing
the gorgonzola cream is what makes this dish if the restaurant wasnt so classy i might pick up the plate and lick it clean
definitely worth venturing and trying some of their teas as well
i went a little bit out of bounds and got the rising sun burgerkobe beef teriyaki glaze and a piece of avocado tempura
the show consisted of a beautiful woman entering her boudoir and preparing herself for an evenings work
this is just based off of what weve ordered on nov 12th 2016 weve watched munchies and thought we gotta try this place out one day
and shrimp scampi was fine with the individual shrimps dancing on the plate in an excellenttasting sizzling lemon butter sauce
we got in through a promoter so the girls got in for free
my friend really liked hakkasan for its 5 floors but other than that it was extremely unimpressive
larissa has always been my server and she rocks
i just have nothing bad to say about this place
definitely a fun way to spend one of my best friends 30th birthday
she knows more about beer than you could possibly imagine and will go to great lengths for you to enjoy them as much as she does
and just sighing and maybe shedding one tear and deciding not to go
the food has always been good and reasonable prices
now let me just say this is the third time i have seen this show
everything is amazing lets start there
wish entrees and dessert had been better
the poboy had a piece of lettuce and two tomato wedges and a sauce
i had no real interest in visiting the club because ive gone on other occasions in years past and while fun i never considered it a mustdo for every trip to vegas
i went with a friend for a girls trip and now i cant wait to come back with my husband
no i am not ashamed to admit it
in the big room your sat next to strangers at big heavy eightseater tables
first time there late valentines celebration
so im from new jersey and ive never heard of this place before
would visit again
this has been my favorite bar in champaign for the five years i have been on campus
poor performance on all counts
very good food and good beer
my review is probably totally biased because after the crappy experience i had at pure the night before a dungeon wouldve blown my mind but holy crap id get i heart tryst tattooed on my back if i could
they have a dart board in one corner along with a karaoke machine or music machine of some sort and it looks like a place that you can establish as your regular spot
this is one of the bastions of old phoenix at its bestor maybe its worst since a lot of the bad old days of corrupt city governance likely took place within durants walls
no big deal i just left them on the plate
now here is something do dont find out side of scottsdale  fresh seafood who would of thunk
this most recent visit i went to celebrate and early birthday dinner
everyone was dressed to the nines
bachi was like other upscale burger joints
luckily the people that were sat at the same small table were  really cool
my husband was not hostile and just wanted to have a good time with our friends not to be attacked by the staff for no reason
and because its small you have to get there early if you dont want to stand for the whole show
it was a thursday night and i was helping to celebrate a friends bachelor party and i had no clue we were going to an actual club the night started at the mgm where 2 of us were meeting the rest of the group and when we did we got word that one of the group members from out of state that happens to be a very successful business owner from houston was on his way in the goliath limo to pick us up
by the time gorgon came on the venue was full and we were ready to boogie
dj is a nice touch if youre looking to just eat drink and groove
my hubby got the scorpion burger and he loved it
hey i didnt make her become a hostess
i walk onto a large patio to sit
decent but nothing special
they play all the sports games and fights here
we have eaten here twice and this was the last
we all did start with the chopped salad which i had never had
i met some friends here to relax after work
service was slow
usually in the summer it is jam packed as they have screens outside with footballrugby on and a bbq going
um holy smoke no pun intended the conflagration nation is truly a flavor that every human on earth should experience
the staff at night in the lobby can be a bit aggressive to guests thinking they are there for the parties
the food was better than expected and the prices are pretty reasonable when compared to the other restaurants in the area
great cigar lounge
its not that anything is wrong with their breakfast but it is just ridiculously overpriced
ok so  this is my second time here in 3 weeks and my husband and i are quite judgmental when it comes to italian food
i almost drove by it without stopping
you can tell that micheal jackson eats sleeps and pisses mj
the only reason i didnt give this place 5 stars was because the veggie pizza had way too many watery veggies on it which caused it to be a very watery pizza
i ordered the special salad and the creamy parmesan dressing was bland
when we went and they had an open pool table so it made it even better
i just love how the crust is crisp yet a bit doughy the ingredients are really fresh and no they are not loaded on the pizza but seriously it would get so heavy and theyd all be falling off anyway if that was the case
the music up here was way better than downstairs
we all really appreciated that
we had a fabulous meal and my fella even raved about how good my leftovers were so we will likely be back soon to give them another go
there is also a short beer list 10ish and about 15 wines
im now a fan because when it comes to sassy waitresses delivering corned beef eggrolls im a pushover
being from the pacific northwest i am very picky about my seafood
unless i just hadnt had them in very long
my friends water was empty for 10 mins before it was even filled up again
once we finally got our food there were no napkins or silverware put into our bag
the decor is beautiful
i just went last night with my friends who originally introduced me to the place and its always a good time
it does not feel like a bar because its so much more
my friends salmon left something to be desired however and we sent back the first one as it was way over cooked
we ordered hummus and veggies
today i had the worst experience i placed my order at 842pm the girl that took my order stated your food should be ready in 15min when i got to the restaurant it was 910pm my food was not ready i had to wait another 20min
i left a good tips due to the attentiveness and advice
i have to say i wasnt impressed and not sure why such high ratings
everyone was super nice
gil met us at the valet and walked us to the party bus
the food was ok in total but the service and the beverages were not up to sanders the water tasted like tap water
both the presentation and the taste of this dish were exceptional
we also ordered up 2 shots and they were probably the best 2 shots ive had
i was working out of town in phoenix recently and visited here on a whim on a sunday evening  wonderful wine on the happy hour list impecable service  i sat at the bar and there were amazing bartenders and the scallops were to die for
speakeasys are typically known for being quiet dark low key hole in the wall establishments however this one was frustratingly loud and had less than desirable drinks
this hotel is perfect to get cleaned up and relax while enjoying the vegas view too
ate dinner at ufficio last night with my daughter
but if youre looking for basic americanfriendly italian olive garden will give you the same menu with a better taste
bianca was excellent and the other one was just a step below
rooms are rocknroll  clean
for presentation alone its worth orderingthe 12 oz pork chop bone in with a layered potato and bacon napoleonlike block that was so delicious and also oozed with cheese flavour along side some greens and apple cider sauce perfectly plated on a butchers wood board
the staff was on point and i watched as half a dozen people got throw out throughout the night
had the mushroom and pancetta pizza here and tried their bloody mary
the brownie by the way is tastysomeone finally put enough ice cream on a dessert to go with the main ingredient
yummy fresh oysters prepared right in front of our eyes at the bar
pros music from 69 pm that is early enough for you to enjoy instead of waiting for late night music that start at 9 or 10 pm
our server was obviously having a rough night
in addition to their rich wood tone dining room is also a cozy bar a cool dark beer dungeon and a really cool outdoor biergarten
truly a great staff
its not out of this world but i think having the name sierra gold and having items on the menu like their signature coocoo fries made me feel as if it was just a more expensive version of sierra gold
only went to sit and have a glass of wine with a friend
the meatballs were decent but the marinara sauce was watery and sparse
their chicken and waffles rock although i will say that lolos edges them out on the fried chicken part the cheddar crusted waffles and the corn and pineapple medley are superb
highly recommend this
for dinner we obviously had to go with the fried chicken
taste 9 quality
awkward as you dont even feel like youre on a date anymore other than with the stranger next to you that youre basically straddling
but if you want a overpriced drink on the strip this is the place to go
a few of my favorites are the west of the andes sandwich bobs bad breath burger and hungarian goulash
she bagged up the order in front of us showing us each dish to ensure that it was correct
without a doubt if you are looking for a fun rowdy comical and memorable night out with your friends or family in las vegas petes is the place to be
the holy trinity is the beef cheek fish spicy chicken
but the saloon seems to be a very popular spot with the south hills crowd
i guess i should only review the venue and not the bands they are booking but the bands they are booking are a great part of the pleasure i get out of this establishment
service was good food was good
i told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests
happy hour is great
it was like eating deepfried ricotta cheese
plus they charge high prices for drinks food and parking
they have plenty of tvs that all around the bar so there is not a bad seat
came in to try out the new m1 driver and was treated terribly
my companion tells me that the mountains are not blue
finally the collard greens were cooked nicely and had no bitterness to them at all
if you use figs in anything youve automatically won my heartseeing as i have the spirit of an 80 year old with a love affair with fig newtons
the afternoon staff was coming in they were all friendly and the manager i think his name was harley was funny and informative to everyone who had questions about the fight
i ordered the crab cake appetizer and the osso buco
no bar rescue here
its cider and fireball whiskey
plus frank spent the last 15 minutes selling his stuff
the caf is bright open and very welcoming
i had the steak special which was 28 and a perfectly cooked tenderloin
prices are reasonable
you get three in an order
it smells less like desperation body odor and vomit
calvin harriss is a regular here so it gets packed on friday nights
you have to literally wait for people to get up and finish eating and run to grab their table
the food was incredibly forgettable
it is a little less hipster full than the usual too so i enjoy it when im sick of the hipster scene at lost leaf
they are the bar tenders personal recipe kudos to the owners for putting an employees recipe on the menu and fantastic
ticket fees are just a thing with most venues
as a few other reviews have mentioned the majority of seating options are outdoors
so if the language of shakespeare burns your little ass try somewhere in the east end and listen to french all night
the staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating
we get there right before 10pm and usually no problem finding a table
we asked for menus which took a while to get too
the poutine is awesome and i love shelleys buffalo mac n cheese
charlotte has many great restaurants so i suggest to go elsewhere until they can get their act together at this one
the sushi and sashimi cuts were uneven almost wedge or doorstoplike
if this is your kinda place have a blast
no its cool
instead the manager said its our company policy to not look
no time for people like that and it seemed to be full of them
great way to start our weekend
i am a huge calamari fan but the breading has to be light and crispy for me to give it lots of stars and this dish won me over
the atmosphere at 5church is like no other in the city of charlotte and the writing is on the wall literally
yes the hot dogs are great the bathroom is awful the staff is great the drinks flow like a river and generally the nickel slots are worth your time and money
it would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller
our rotation of munchies includes potato skins sans bacon hummus wings fried mozzarella and always fried pickles
but wow it was sinfully tasty
the valet seems super slow here
well seasoned but not too salty
the beer selection is nicely cultivated as well
for my taste i might call tfc the best restaurant in pittsburgh
i hate the mushy canned beets but i do think that fresh beets should still be cooked enough so that they can be cut with a fork
huge portions of all your breakfast favorites
i always make my friends come here whenever we are out vegas and its consistently been a fun way to start the night
a fantastic little get away from the beautiful casino action
carafes on the table throughout the meal
we have dined here twice and left full and happy
just visited for the first time and we love it
pretty good greasy sandwich
nice little place
variety of beer with a variety of prices
on a busy wednesday evening
the crab was okay
luckily a beer and some time later bob saved me with the palace pan roast
and they really delivered on it
those 2 staffers and the awful food will be the reasons i will never go back
just try it once and then savor the experience forever
but overall this is definitely a cute place and i can see myself making this place a regular
i wouldve posted a photo but i ate it to fast
i believe it gives you access to any and all private airline lounges
seems like they nickel and dime you
plus the disneyland you deal with in vegas is a lot cooler than the real one
im a big guy and ive never in my life failed to finish a burger
this location is super convenient since i live up the street but every single time ive been here it just isnt good
unfortunately with this package everyone at the table has to get it
this is my favorite place to get a slightly dirty dry martini  the bartenders know how to make them
love the 5 cherry bombs
garlic prawns  large portion big enough to share
i was thinking that this place would be flooded with drunk college kids but i was wrong
lots of cherries but very little crisp or ice cream
big food size for happy hour
go to the pool at the wynn and pool party at encore classy
my husband ordered the italian panini with the greek fries  not sure what special spices they put in the fries but those were very addicting
the hostess was very kind and accommodating
about half way through the steak my friend said its so rich that i feel nauseous
i have an oil allergy
pros cirque du soleil aerial dancers and random live art are so much fun to watch pretty short line if youre on the vip list the club is set up on three levels that all open to look down on the dance floor and the huge screens covering the wall behind the dj that show an awesome light show young and attractive crowd i didnt see anyone old there all staff that i talked to were helpful and professional
highly recommended for cheap drinks and good conversations
the waiter was quick to come by and checked on is fairly frequently
what more can you ask for
order a bit rarer than you normally would as they seem to be a bit conservative in their definition of medium
for dessert the sticky toffee cake was heavenly and topped with their mascarpone gelato  worth every calorie
i wish they would have done the scolding not me oh well
prices were very reasonable too 4 street tacos steak queso and a horchata all for 24
to the owners of the former tiki hideaway i applaud you for your courage to try something new and give the people of charlotte something they had never experienced before  perhaps it was something the community was not ready for yet
the grilled bologna sandwich brought back memories of youth
otherwise its luck of the draw
scallops over butternut squash risotto was good
you know you are getting fresh well prepared real food
asked her to please double check and it turns out i was right they were to play later at 1130pm
ordered food and waited more than an hour at this point
by the end of the long and heated conversation their basic comeback was that when i was asked to leave i should have left and because i didnt thats when i became a nuisance and the bouncers had the right to touch me because i was apparently also trespassing
i loved the veggie benedict
the service is great
i recommend doing fremont street once at least during your trip
for the first time i found myself out in lakewood for a meal
i was at marquee two different times for a bachelorette weekend at the nightclub  dayclub
this place is acceptable for a suburb in the desert
first timer impressions yesterday i decided to try this place with some friends just because of the great yelp reviews it had
the food was average which is actually fine by me at a bar
almost anything would have been better
their nachos were cheese sauce lettuce tomatoes olives and jalapenos served almost 30 minutes after ordered for 699
try the brussels sprouts and the fennel salad too
great addition to carefree  cave creek
i do have two gripes
its not a huge space compared to the mega clubs but its fairly large
every magic trick went wrong in every way
i could not believe my ears and i asked him to repeat himself
the menu is huge with tons of variety
the staff is either really good or basically rude
the meals were great
awesome vibe solid beer and subpar food
one of the best restaurants that i have eaten at recently
had a blast at wet republic but full disclosure im a girl and not unattractive
you will not find meltedcheeseladen food here which is a good thing
escargots 35 stars
when the weather is nice grab a table outside
i really liked their miso soup it didnt have tofu which made me happy
if youre a baseball fan you definitely have to come to watch the game from this incredible view
ended up at coach and willies
wow wow  wow
the gumbo was also a big disappointment to me where is the heat
their burgers have to be the star attraction of the lunch menu
for the second round i ordered a tankhouse a pale ale brewed by the mill st brewery httpwwwmillstreetbrewerycom located in torontos distillery district
nice place to try
i had a couple of different margaritas the traditional was my favorite
but at 11pm there werent too many options
i felt that han ba tang has provided something creative here
you may not get this lucky so dont get your hopes up
on our way out is when someone finally took notice and asked if something was wrong i gave them the same treatment and said nothing
and the other two really enjoyed their meals as well
unto the food so far ive only tried their tuscan grilled pork chops beef carpaccio this appetizer is a must filet mignon and some pasta
this is the classic capital grille experience
as i was finishing up the bartender and i chatted for a while and i discovered then that he is the owner
most disappointing meals ever
two words loved it
and best part is that they offer beer flights of any of the 50 drafts this is a great idea that not many tap rooms employ
i forgot how huge this thing was
that aside it is a romantic little spot for good conversation with friends or a date
the restaurant was about halffull though part of the reason is its huge with a great casual patio
what the hell is white rice doing in a mexican restaurant
with 20 mouthwatering courses his avant garde brand of sweet and savory cuisine will slap your taste buds around like a night with ike turner and chris brown
the second time here in one night and the roasted chicken is so crisp but juicy at the same time
though thin the fries were very tasty and were plentiful as well
it was truly one of those food experiences that i will cherish for many years to come
great place for a lazy afternoon
love the food here
d that she wasnt taking care of her customers
it really helps people communicate more
whether they actually did or not i can honestly say it made no difference whatsoever
i really enjoyed it
the internetconnectedness was cool and all but we went back i think once
the cheapest bottle is skyy vodka which runs a paltry 425
the scampi was great
after a short wait we sat down and proceeded to order about half of the menu
came on a sunday to watch the cards
i appreciate the hard working servers and did not see any slacking off as other reviewers mentioned
get your wings the works its an insider flavor thats sweet and spicy
also we were the only people under the age of 65 in there
i will definitely be visiting this place again hopefully for the meatloaf
we ended up walking out
crinkle cut french fries accompany the meals
hostess showed us to table in back of restaurant
some other highlights include a grilled salmon thats surprisingly good and the fried pickle chips lizard freckles
someone in the marketing department need to know what works in the dark lighting
i wont be back though its seriously grody inside and if there are no mold issues they at least need air purifiers thruoghout
a sudden craving for buffalo wings struck and off we were to find a pubstyle spot with simple pub food and a couple of beers
i would go back to vegas just to have another dining experience here
and the food is great too
id be interested to go back with a larger group so we could try more things and to try halcyon in different seasons
my favorite bite was the green tea cheesecake dessert
calamari is amazing as well as the coconut shrimp
b is apparently too delicate a flower to wipe beer foam off her chin so she settled in with an appletini which looked pretty and which she said was decent
delicious food and great service
since it was friday the place was loud but the energy of the room was good and the service was outstanding   especially for a cleveland restaurant
its a nice place to get an average meal but nothing more
when she came with the check she was very rude at which point i stated it would have been helpful to be advised how long we would be waiting so we could decide if we even wanted dessert in the first place since we were on our way to the botanical garden light display
i chose a table in the lounge so i could watch the 17 or so big screen tvs
im not complaining
i was sitting at a booth with my hubby and we were ignored by at least 4 waitresses
review on bilos for a group function i came here for a surprise birthday party on a saturday night
yes im advising you to order salmon at olive garden
i enjoy this place
they also have some pretty solid drink specials here
i came to holsteins a couple of times and the first time was great
beautiful view of the bellagio water display
this is honestly the best place to eat in berea
i got the fish taco for my entree and was quite pleased with it
happy hour wasnt very happy as the drinks were only a dollar or 2 cheaper when advertised at 5 when they are like 13
once she was made aware we all had one of their signature drinks
it was a huge portion and was very delicious
my advice come in have a drink with friends and jump on the seesaw for kicks then head to the next bar
we had a seat on the patio with a wobbly table
this place is awesome
very nicely done and the portion size for the greens was ok  the place isnt much to look at
still having an open mind we walked the confined venue trying to connect with it in some way
finally had to flag down a random waitress to get service
it was an okay experience
i couldnt imagine coming here to watch a game because despite their large quantity of tvs they are all too small and cheap in quality
our server never bothered to ask how our food was but if he did we would have sent back the wagu hache burnt egg on top of an overcooked hamburger patty
well worth the money
4 kimchi poutine update they had totally upped their game this time
the chips and salsa were the best part of the meal
this place is absolutely awful and completely unprofessional
she interacted with us in a positive way despite that we were there for winterlicious which i know often can be a turn off for a lot of servers and sometimes they get cranky but she was great even offering to take photos for us and let one of our friends try on her vest
and the foodomg you must try the duck rueben it sounds bizarre and it isa little but it is sooo good
i would say give it a try
they were log shaped fried  tasted like instant mashed potatoes with a hint of cheese
the food is seoul style which isnt my favorite but good in quality
they carried the terrazas i had at 806 so i went with a few of those washing down my angus korean sliders with the customary ketel one dirty wstuffed bleu cheese olives
patria is under the same ownership as weslodge and similar to weslodge this place is jam packed with beautiful people and crazy busy
assuming its the norm and everywhere else is priced like this id definitely eat here again
instead of an english muffin the eggs came with creamy scalloped potatoes on the bottom
ribs and slaw  good brewerycant beat the prices
but according to my husband they do have a changing station in the mens room which is super hard to find
i have found the servers to be rather attentive and friendly
service was good but overall not worth the price 190 with two drinks
generally we drink or tea sweetened but the tea was so delicious that we didnt need to add sugar
from the entrance the club looked small and made me glad i dont frequent this airport but mad i have status with united
nice atmosphere and reasonable prices
nice clean and quite
its just so necessary when you dont want your alch level to dip below the legal limit i mean its a bar come on help me drink more
i need to get over there and try out that fresh bar house or barse or the northern beer temple clone in a house version
the staff are still friendly and superhelpful and they seem to be becoming more aware of the need to modulate the music so its not quite so blaringly intrusive
most importantly our server was very nice and didnt ignore us when we didnt order drinks right away
we had nachos veggie pizza macaroni and cheese macaroni pizza
the music is great but not a dominant feature of the place
recommend going with a group
we sat down it was very busy
sounds weird but its just that dang good
absolutely out of this world
there is a dj and a lead hype man who works the room messing wfolks wishing happy bday etc
theres a always a couple of food trucks parked out front a quiznos a capriottis in the rjc  unless you work there be prepared to take off your shoes and go through a metal detector  and a few cafes that are just aok i would place courthouse bar  grill in that category
the urth burger on the menu was pretty decent for vegans
had to use the bathroom right after i ordered and one of the two toilets was overflowing and full of crap kinda put a damper on the dining experience
didnt have a chance to try the paella coz it would take too long
the bar tender is a crabby lady was there twice and she cut me off for nothing think she had personal issues with me  not sure if it had to do with my looks or because i was too pleasant for this bar savannah is her namei would never return to this place if it was the last place with booze on earth ignorant and disrespectful bartendersad thing is i know 50 of her customersmostly bikers hang out and not very friendly
almost as small as the temple on first street a little exaggeration there
we stayed here for a few hours before we left and definitely one of the better bars we visited of all the places we went in montreal
i walked in and the friendly host let me know that the bar area was selfseating and that we could order at the bar if we chose one of the nearby high top tables
i would never return
also very bland no taste
we continued to enjoy the popovers and the calamari
hiroshi  if you are reading this  order more because we drank your last bottle
were talking turtle speed
aller on tente un dernier bout de rue avant daller se rfugier chez nous
never disappointed when we come here
i got another one of those
with that being said the beautiful female waitstaff will not pay any attention to you if youre female
like i said the outside has potential
we went there late night last night and a sudden craving for breakfast hit while i was staring at the menu
room had plenty of extras such as water trail mix and coffee in the room
it was negative in context so the owner complained to yelp and had it removed
moral of the story is dont expect vip treatment just because you paid the vip prices
jai finalement fait le grand saut
our friends grabbed a table and a server came over
the reward for each doubleyou w an arrbeevee rbv  red bull vodka
the waitress i had was great and the drinks were cheap and strong  but not enough so to bring me back in the future
perhaps another visit might raise or lower my rating of aok the service was good
kudos and thanks for a great dining experience
my only complaint was really the bathroom  they have one bathroom with one stall for men i heard women have two stalls
and why was it served with just lettuce you are suppose to use as cups
its just an awesome place to hangout and enjoy a decent meal
the food and service has declined over the years
we ordered several starters including the hummus and the filet tartar
would come back to try another burger maybe it was an off day
its pricy but worth it
honestly i wanted to lick the bowl
some opened the ropes and snuck in some pushed up to be with people they knew
that is basically all who stays out there just full of smoke
i do suggest that you should be able to make reservations regardless of the  of party and mixed drinks would be awesome
i had the beef soondubu jiggae the seafood pancake and the beef tartare
the only real downer was the ac that didnt really work
now its just like every other bar on the strip without the flare show
prices were not crazy
i had been here previously with my girlfriend and we enjoyed our night so much we figured wed come back
i brought my work peeps there for a birthday lunch
good beers and a more than average stock of whisky
recommend making reservation on weekend
simple and elegant  they do have several complimentary sauces you can add on the side but we found then completely unnecessary
if not youll probably end up feeling worse about yourself than when you stepped out of your rental hyundai
an item i will go back for too he gave me a small bite
the restaurant itself has a lot of character and ambiance
my wife was visiting and told me there are a bunch of erotic art collections that are priceless displayed
mckibbins has a warm and friendly atmosphere making it a the pub to go to in the pointeclaire area
ive walked past the ri ra in downtown charlotte nc about a thousand times and ive yet figured out its a chain
this location is busy but ive never felt i had to wait too long to get food once seated
the other clubs in vegas are far more better than prive will ever be
lots of service mistakes   menu is small and limited
went to jasmine last night for the first night the decor was nice and i love the butterfly theme
and hey the food is great
it looked a little sketchy from the outside but the inside was nice and comfortable
my dh had a jalapeno margarita1300 and i had the 2 glasses of red that were included
i loved it to say the least
had a great waitress and enjoyed both meals and drinks
i think that tryst nails the hybrid clublounge scene
cant wait to come back and test out more of the menu
i like the layout of this club
if i could rate even higher i would
my wife and i had an excellent experience on valentines day
my kids and i really enjoyed the garlic cheese fries as an appetizer
tip try the roadrunner over on hayden
took a chance and glad we did
yummy but nothing that stood out as amazing
havent been back in a minutebut soho is still killin it i see errr taste
there is no competition here all just people looking to play some good ol pool
seriously sooo much fun
the calamari reminds me of the dish that we had a few times at the rg lounge in san francisco
their fried tilapia is one of the best i had in my life super crisp and not greasy
service 5 stars i could say that the biggest reason that will get me come back here again is the service
every single time we visit toronto we hit up this place for all i can drink purple hazes and a giant table full of appetizers
this is one of the first restaurants we visted when we were moving to cleveland
auch den french toast kann ich sehr empfehlen dazu werden ahornsirup nussbutter und ein kleiner obstsalat gereicht
we were really pleased
it was a complete nightmare
it came  with a crispy crust perched on a bed of lime and cilantro basmati rice ginger bok choy miso butter sauce and crispy leeks
despite its name this place is a great little diner
they have a great selection of meat and vegetarian burgers too
the staff is very friendly too
thank goodness i was on a list of some sort or i wouldve never gotten in its nearly a fact
beautiful restaurant overpriced food
the bridetobes first lapdance was from a polish guy
straight up drug lords spending hundreds on bottle after bottle and inviting random girls to join them
what has changed
been to cwb twice
its just awkward
the space is bright open and welcoming
the food was outstanding
i ate the whole thingit was good  they have some interesting beers here so its a fun place to try new things
when i think of macncheese i think of only getting this dish as soul food restaurants normally when i am back east or down south but they actually did a very good job with the flavors
yeah ive gotten several deliveries from the good people at social box and i have to say for me this is as good as it gets
both stated that their food was equally as good as mine
it is a very nice well decorated place and we will be back for sure
we drove by and it wasnt busy at all and had plenty parking
what about a two person family
we took out of town guests for happy hour and ordered the arrancinifabulous as always
see the picture hardly any place to stand
how do they make vegan pastries so delicious
i barely made it out of there in time
another place in the rio that i love
i think a certain pop artist overhyped this place
the service was quick and very friendly and the beer selection was very good  lots of nc stuff thats hard to find elsewhere
there was hardly any cheddar in the patty
i felt guilty eating it because it was so rich but it was so good
overall nice place for casual dining
the prices for this start around 120  not too bad
word of mouth guys
thats the only reason id come back the music
great trendy interior
all in all id come back for happy hour  but sit in regular chairs and leave before my ears reached sensory overload
my husband had the pasta dish he said he would order that again
this time shane and this lady named danielle was there
the second time i went was a terrible experience
they have great food definitely the wings i always go in and order wings
right when we sat down a cocktail waitress came by and asked us if we wanted any drinks from the bar
the scallop roll is definitely the light of my life
we came in based on a review in the paper on their french toast
im having the italian sausage pizza
i had to eventually ask a host to provide the check since i couldnt find our waiterturns out he was hiding behind the aforementioned curtain
i like that theyve opened up the lounge space so its easier to get seated when theyre crowded
zero stars would be more accurate but not a choice
they typically draw a pretty good crowd that doesnt seem to let up until late in the evening
the environment is obviously gorgeous being inside the cosmopolitan the service is mediocre at best the drinks are amazing
while olive or twist is not a five star restaurant it gets 5 stars from me because i love it
sadly our service was terrible the first night and not much better today
great food service and atmosphere
i didnt need to eat for the rest of the day
a lot of bands play here and some pretty big ones too ie lamb of god
however the olive garden at this location is above the rest
we both enjoyed our meals and the service was good but overall i felt like it was a place out of the 70s not necessarily bad
classic toronto bathrooms
i will go back tho and probably give it 4 stars after
one person even got up and went to the bar to order drinks and grab us plates
of course i chose the kobi beef which was the best decision of my life
then when she looked at me after flirting with the guy she went from giddy to annoyed resting face instantly which i thought was pathetic
their menu was a good range from pasta to burgers to steak
ive never gone to a restaurant where i could not get the full menu at the bar
they were good together but im not sure i would have liked the bananas without the ice cream
highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great italian meal
they have a decent selection of beer even tho i usually get fat tire or blue moon which are both on tap
we then saw the same girl crystal i believe shaking down other people
too bad but well be back
the food is pretty decent but the main allure is the drinks in my opinion
his whole demeanor just puts you at ease
not only yummy everything was fresh and screams authenticity given the fact that theyre really japs
i have tried to come to this place a couple times but usually when they are completely full but his time i went with a friend to watch a football game on sunday afternoon
not that flavorful wasnt really exciting ill pass on that from now on
the duck burger was mouth watering
my mouth waters thinking of it
my friend got the 15 chinese black tea but she didnt like it at all
such a gem in the heart of university circle
could tell she was probably running all over the place but she had an attitude nonetheless
bottom line  food was great but management has a lot of work to do
unfortunately they dont serve traditional bread and there is no long cucumber salad on the menu
now i understand that psh is new and wants to make sure everything is done by the book but my motherinlaw had lost her drivers license and tilah would not take her glass of wine order without an id
the show was great and well performed but the men at times werent enthusiastic
i love this place
apparently  is a magnet for critics bloggers food photographers yelpers
two thumbs up
that really hit the spot
at other times the pricing seems high for what you get
oh and for added fun  we enjoyed playing the are the waitresses twins
it was disappointing
they offer exactly what most people want seats beer fatty foods and just enough tv and music
otherwise id recommend anywhere else including the alleyway nearby
the place feels kind of cramped once youre in there
if you have nowehere else to go to smoke shisha or dont own a pipe then this would not be a bad spot to hit
so your free drink will cost you at least 9 if you order off the menu
my chicago buddy with me was unimpressed  but im sure places like this are a dime a dozen there
vip area had bars set up with cocktails beer wine and separate nice restrooms
went here once with my wife and parents and thought it was nice
so buttery and flavorful
sat at the bar for 15mins or more and still not being acknowledged
if you want a neighborhood bar where you feel welcome regardless who you arethis is the place you want to be
maybe on a differant night the experience would have been better
had a holiday work event here recently and it was a blast
food is good and prices are fair
i must say the staff was awesome super friendly and fast and on top of their guests every need
this place is morbidly overpriced the food is average at best
overall i will not be returning it seems perhaps another soft opening is in order as well as a new menu better suited for an even flow of fresh ingredients
the fish tacos are a must order here
im probably the only person who hates this trend solely because its so trendy im looking at you pinterest
i loved the whole look of the place from the second we walked in
came back daily many mornings during my montreal stay
i havent been to others
i came here with my girlfirends and a baby for lunch
great for families or date nights
my wife had the conchinita pibil and it was the best either of us ever had
the drinks i had the zombie is was very yummy and really good
i definitely recommend the billionaire bacon but anything you choose will be delicious
by the time i got my drink all the water was gone
it tasted like water and splenda
had the sunday roast
beverages  ok  main course   paneer tikka  it was not cooked properly
the porridge is very tasty especially with the compote added
so there you have it good foodawesome schnitzelbut the friendliness and sensitivity of our waitress left much to be desired
that 12 was taken off expeditiously although with no apology or acknowledgement
my same friend and i visited tonight for a quick meal and were surprised to see it almost empty with no more than 30 guests in the restaurant
luckily a few seats at the bar opened up and we nabbed those right away
even if people watching is not your thing go there for the amazing food and wait staff
leur salade tait plutt digne dune salade daccompagnement dailleurs javais quasiment la mme avec ma crpe et a manquait un peu de fromage de chvre pour le prix
i know the current trend is bottomless but i usually only order one or two anyway or my whole day is shot because im stuck on the sofa in a drunken overstuffed stupor
overall decent venue but food needs an upgrade really just some tlc
i dont go super hot but they have a good range of heat and some honey hots and other good stuff  i say mix it up a bit and try em all out
we still hung in and received cheese less 4 cheese mac and cheese a well done steak instead of a medium no ketchup for burgers sour yogurt for the kids and no apologies for the poor service
the bee was slow i actually think it was a wasp
we each took a couple bites and had to go find our waitress
justin was a great server drinks were stellar ribeye steak was perfection had it w bleu cheese atop it
theres a back patio with cornhole and plenty of seating so you can enjoy killer phoenician weather this time of year
unfortunately they came out with my burger but those were the best taer tots in the world
much better italian places then this
typical melt decor vintage kitschy plastic holiday yard decorations random beer signs wood and brick
its the best thing on the menu for everyone that i have brought to try
went here for the 1st time on tuesday and it was great
my favorite dish is the stir fried intestines  blood sausage steamed pork  cabbage wrap ox tail beef soup potato pan cake and many more all delicious
overall the entire time our waitress continually forgot to bring us very basic things like beverages sauce our check
once for the order and once to get the check
plenty of restaurants in the phoenix area and we will not be heading back to fountain hills anytime soon
i would skip this entirely next time
also once in a while this girl dressed up as a mermaid dances in a volcano and does a sort of pole dance in a giant blender
as for the food it was excellent
stopped in again for happy hour with friends  beautiful day so i sat on the patio
youd think that you could at least wash it down with a cold beer but whatever room they keep their kegs in must just have a window unit air conditioner
danach unbedingt weiter zu gls dner nebenan
but we all had a chill time
a can of chef boyadee would be better than this crap
amazing patio delicious burger
long story short its a piece of pittsburgh historyits not the greatest eatery but i think its okay
we walked but it looks like parking is easy enough
the original soup i got seemed to be the last bowl of the pot not so good but my second bowl was much much better
it was the ohio showcase for the inductions at the rock hall week
good food good service
im not trying to fall asleep here
wednesdays are great due to their latin nights but they accumulate one hell of a crowd
we were able to view the whiskey room but stuck to several different types of beers during our visit
there is something for everyone here
ive never been to a slim and chubbys but i have to say i was impressed with the wings at this place
this is insane
think rusty rudder on lake norman but not as good
been here a few times and this is what ive learned dinner and brunch are different experiences for food quality in my opinion
the celery i ate was crunchy
the service is truly terribly if you dont enjoy pretentious venues avoid this place for sure
our waitress was very nice and told us our specials
there is plenty of room and cornhole outside
i would give this a 5 star but the service was terrible
their beer selection is top notch  you name it they probably have it including delirium tremens which i cant get in london
a small piece of salmon over a bed of pasta the risotto almost made me cry it had bacon in it
i will say i love the venetian its one of my favorite places on the strip
the service is baffling
the special sauce got me
the booths are very comfortable cushion wise however since the place was very very busy it made it hard to get out of the booth once you got in the booth
aside from that being dirty the plates that were already placed on the table looked used or unwashed
buffet style food has never been so good
will most definitely be coming back
gostei tanto que repeti a dose ontem
we will go again every
the rolls were good but i cant remember which one
we were seated in a booth almost immediately and had a really nice waitress who had the diner customer service sassy dattitude down
not that i mind the regular uniform but it is not a bad thing to be served your meal from a swat officer complete with skirt and handcuffs from time to time  julee was very prompt with order and refills
the well drinks adequate
the men are good looking and do they know about it too
i was looking forward to a relaxing bath in the tub but i came to discover it was poorly cleaned and there were public hairs in it
looking for a fun hole in the wall dive bar in urbana
they only thing i would recommend is that if you do plan on coming on a weekend theyre most likely going to be packed so call ahead for reservations
i even won 250 on penny slots my room was on the 23rd floor and i could hear the loud music  if you are a light sleeper request a high floor
we were there for brunch so i got the benedict florentine and others got the country fried steak and the banana pecan pancakes
the event is basically held in a parking lot with astroturf on top of it
and if youre really fortunate you might hit on a night when dr zombo breaks out the guitar and joins fellow musicians for surf rock sounds by vertigo go
i wont be back
as for the food it was all good for what it is
they even gave us little celebration gifts for our babymoon
came by for my usual chocolate croissant and cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised that theyve remodeled
it started out when i first got there
they were passable
i will not return
out server was attentive and quite knowledgable she even had all of the specials memorized
the second question had to do with a list of items shrimp and avocado etc
thank you local yelppers helping us find this gem on the way to the airport from red rocks
waitress was attentive refilling drinks and checking in on our table
his motto for his bar is the friendliest wine bar in scottsdale and the original wine pub and fine wines and sublime times
there was a large group of what appeared to be zappos people outside
they took 3 of them fried put it on top of some rot spinach leaves and had the audacity to serve it with a smile
great food drinks  atmosphere and service
my girlfriends took me here for my birthday
the chef personally delivered the replaced dish and the manager personally came by to make sure everything else was to our satisfaction
i received the best service ever
all the food has been wonderful and flavorful
we were compltely transfixed on the movie within a minute i dont know what it is about those movies the flavors were amazing and the special menu from your foursquare checkin is always good and wellpriced
side note they dont actually sell package liquors this is a cocktail lounge only
third what makes this place even more interesting is the music they play
i had the smoked salmon and pesto and the artichoke spread sooooo tasty
my companions also raved about their meat dishes
the food came up quickly and was delicious as was the sweetwater ipa
ill be back
weve been here twice now and both times we were unimpressed with the service
good beer selection
i thought i was going to die in the theatre
i agree that the titantic piece was rather depressing in relation to the whole happygolucky theme of the show
service was fine
beim dritten versuch bestellte ich cola und hatte dann nach ca
hahaha it will cost you but its kind of worth it
they dont overload on ipas like ive been noticing at other beer establishments
i celebrated my birthday there with 25 people and not only would we never go back but we would never recommend it to anyone again especially groups
i was happy with the fact i recieved a real drink
the burger patty is so great that it seems such a shame to pair it with a cheap grocery store bun and tasteless fries
hands down the best beer place probably in all of markhamrh
the whole ordeal could have been avoided if marcus would have said something to me the parent instead of reprimanding my child as if it was his own by avoiding conversation with me and taking the liberty to remove something out of his hand again without my consent
i will be back for sure
we came back the next day no free round with our purchase but the price was raised
when he put it back on the bar and left his tip and signature looked like a seismology graph
die atmosphre ist typisch studentisch ebenso publikum und personal
off the hook great bar but its more than just a bar its a playground for adults
if you have even one guy even if you wanted bottle service or what not youd have to stay in the general line
i have to add though that you should consult your physician if your kilt tilts for more than four continuous hours
asked for the chops to be grilled medium so they werent dried out
floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides with plenty to see especially at night
pasta dish cold and lacking flavor
but stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service
my buddy melanie does not like sweet desserts so our waiter kevin recommended the cherry panna cotta with pecans vanilla cream amarena cherry and a dusting of dark chocolate around the plate
i chose this place as they supposedly had a decent beer selection
i convinced my cousins to come back later for a night cap and some appetizers and the same manager delivered our food and said i see you cam back
so a group of about 25 of us went to ab last night for restaurant week
i have not been back since last september
spent the new years eve here a year ago and it was absolutely poppin
we ordered the gorgonzola fries to start
im sicilian and know good italian food
i questioned almost every design choice in there and i never notice things like that
the layout was cool open concept gets pretty loud since you can watch the game and  the sls sports book is inside umami
i would be happy to go back
the setting is also amazing its dark they play the best music and they have black lights too
during badger football season echo tap has a free shuttle to camp randall
conclusion if the service wasnt so dull and cold i would have given it 4stars for the delicious beer
from presentation and taste service and atmosphere right up to the bite you take out of my wallet everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me
check them out
had the meat and cheese board very nice variety
the pork belly is complete disaster as well
the beer and wine selection is great
now that would be amazing
everyone in the place was frozen since theres no entryway and every time the door opened the whole place was blasted with icy air
never going back
i came here on my most recent trip to las vegas
as my sister and i were just sitting around waiting for the time to go by so we could go to dinner the bartender comes up to us and says shot time and puts two green colored shots in front of us it was st pattys day gave a couple next to us two shots too and he took a shot as well
samba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in vegas and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious
maybe 30 minutes after we ordered
the sauce was fantastic
the paint on the flooring in front of the toilet was all worn away and greyish looking
that hunk of flesh on my plate wasnt seared it was charred
ok look  i know they cant all be elizabeth berkley may the lord keep her feisty nomi malone safe and warm forever
we didnt see our original server again until we flagged down the hostess to have someone bring us our cheque
we finished our drink and booted out of there
immer wieder hin zur minibar
wings are probably some of the best in the valley
we all ordered different glasses of wine which again took probably another 10 minutes
stopped in for appetizers and a couple drinks on a monday afternoon while on vacation
a different guy comes and brings our appetizer and as he sits it down i ask him to have our waitress come over
entrees  his pork chop was good and my burger was good but it was overcooked and needed some acidity  sweet onion sweet pickle and lots of fat need something to cut them a bit
she never mentioned it again
their food is no longer the great delicious quality that it used to be
third of all the chicken was dry asf no dipping sauce for our dry ass chicken
love the trees the lighting and the comfy chairs
unfortunately we wont be going back
my friends and i bought table service and got 4 bottleswe were told by our promoter tiffany that we were allowed 4 pplbottle
there was nothing wagyu about it
if youre into independent arcades youll fall in love with this place within your first hour
they really put me off when we went to pay for the tab
yes you will be paying 5 for a bottle of apple juice and a few dollars more than you would expect for salads and scones but the quality is good and you can eat and be back out on the casino floor in twenty minutes
i had the opportunity to attend the festival as a patron and as a vendor so i was able to see the festival from multiple perspectives and essentially give this a very well rounded review
i took another bite and its still raw inside
the binions cafe has a nice one for 495
i can only hope this gets addressed
having been to the west room once for a quick drink i suggested we go for lunch
i got beer battered lots of beer flavoring
we were saying goodbye to one of my awesome coworkers and really couldnt have asked for a better place
the service was horrible
but dont let him keep you away
amazing food good drink selection along with a welcoming atmosphere
it was worth it to have drinkfood service and a safe place for our things
the steak on the other hand was a little overcooked and got more salty with every bite
but i realize it will kill the ambiance to have televisions in here
there are lots of tvs and one can see a screen no matter where youre sitting
not only did he wait 20 more minutes but the shrimp was cold not cleaned properly and the sauce was tasteless like some unsalted vegetable broth
jeez with all the seating you could sit a small town in there and it doesnt seem like that big of a building
the crispiness of the rice added a new texture and me and my friends got really excited about what else was to come
beautiful awesome exciting fantastic and wonderful scenery
i asked them to make it spicy i like me my spices
the wine selections here are always great but they also have a good assortment of beers liquors  cordials
i didnt think you could mess up fried rice but it is very possible
food was fine but almost beside the point
she always had a smile on her face and always made sure that we had a drink and something to eat which i very much appreciated
later another server came with 1 beer i thought it was strange
which is fine im all about creating the right atmosphere but the limited information on the menu doesnt lend itself to the correct drink choice for your tastes
they bring over a pot with a layer of biscuit on top slowly cut the biscuit inside is the cream vegetables lobster still with shell then they lay it out on your plate on top of the removed biscuit top
for some reason this reminds me a bit of dukes in waikiki
i had one bite and decided not to eat anymore
this is our goto for a sitdown dinner place
yes the crowd is definitely older and not that appealing for the 20 something yr olds but i find that pure provides a really nice atmosphere to party with your friends
the other components set off the sweetness of the grilled fig
we sat there for over 10 minutes watching the staff huddled together and just talking to each other
it came with green chile mac n cheese which was tasteless and the jicama slaw well the jicama was okay but the cabbage was bitter and the dressing did not help it at all
either way i doubt ill be giving this kelseys another shot anytime soon which is sad since its the local kelseys where i live
they offered 5 apps until 7 pm which we tried to take advantage of but since the service was slow our waiter didnt check on us until after 7 and we got charged full price on two of the three we ordered
portion is small but very wellbalanced flavor of slightly salty from the caviar to the citric from the tomatoes and slight crunch from the toast
purely coincidence and ill review the most recent visit arrived with the gang around 1030
this was a fun experience
i think he may try to convince me to fly back to phoenix just for that dish
thank you chef
im a single malt scotch guy so seeing multiple scotch options at a venue bar gets me excited
we ordered an appetizerhot wings they were yummy and the bloody marries tasted oh so good
its such a shame because their food is amazing and their signature cocktails are delicious
walk in to see the worlds longest bar  hence the name long bar  with the best flair bartenders you will ever meet
there is a fun energy to this place and i would recommend it for an outing with friends or a date
thats why im giving it 3 stars
i was disappointed when she forgot about requests for more biscuits and ketchup   overall soho has a lot of things right but shouldnt be afraid of being boring for not pushing the boundaries on a classic dish
i had the tavern burger which is a beef bison  pork burger red onion marmalade cornichon aioli housecut fries and added the fried egg
could it have been a good mealyes maybe on another night when more attention was paid to the details
the fries are served in a heaping pile
the tempura was delicious with a crunchy mix of veggies fried to perfetion
we ate in the bar area this past memorial day and were treated the same as if we had made reservations
the service has always been good for me here
overall a nice place to sit and relax on a sunny day
maybe due to space concerns
then you stand a better chance
there is nothing good about this placethe girls are pathetic beggars who are on average 20 lbs overweight
average sports bar nothing extremely exciting
great food and atmosphere
it was high tops and a sectional seating that were in front of the band
she was satisfied
sneaky dees has maintained its high level of grittiness over the years
we could barely eat the fries
the event was great the trucks were yummy the cookie bar was delicious the music was poppin the yelp tent was oh so fabulous and the wind was blowin
this place is amazing
i have eaten here twice before and not really loved it but third times the charm and im never going back
i also tried my brothers steak and it  as great too
went for lunch i had fish n chips my wife had the chicken avacodo bacon sandwich
the bite size smidgen appetizer could have been double the size
we sat on the patio on  a warm summer night
its like some grandscale version of the hyatts equinox in san francisco when they were open
last thing look at your receipt twice
i can only assume that the waitstaff just didnt really care about serving us because they had already tacked on an 18 gratuity charge to our bills
staff became aggressive towards patrons without being provoked
the calamari was absolutely delicious as i had expected
tremont seriously impresses me more and more every time i go out
one of us didnt get any of her four orders for over 30 mins and had to watch others eat
came here because of a 30 groupon deal
it all tasted pretty good but i wouldnt recommend it for 25
im not usually a fan of themed restaurants but i was thinking about a prior trip to st thomas and hoped it would let me escape dreary pittsburgh
i had the benko burger and id have to give it 23 stars
great for taking the family out for a fun night or as a date night or just solo
we were so grateful
the seabass was crispy
thats fine the voucher hadnt been out long but if an establishment is going to run a deal like that the entire staff needs to be aware of it before greeting tables
atmosphere and service was good
i live in the neighborhood and love their food but this is a bar with gray food not a restaurant
teared up manuals so we cant read them
side notewolves at the gate rocked
no wonder they have like 20 promoters outside trying to get people in
im not in vegas anymore but i will go to the riverside ca restaurant when i get the chance
they were not mean about it in any way so thanks for that i guess
it got really over packed and it was just as inside as it was outside because of everyone in there
it looks like it might be a good place to party after all
they thought it tasted pretty good
i doubt i will be back to any og anytime soon
almond tofu  dude
fish and chips are great
giving them 1 star because after reading my yelp review they not only reached out to me to apologize for what happened but also invited me back to try and remedy the situation
1 dollar pool tables are absurd
the coating is complex and contains several jamaican spices
im not sure how this place has any stars at all
twice ive had the cesar salad
the bar area is fun and entertaining as people are always passing though to get a drink  last time i was there we stayed for a good 5 hours drinking and eating and met a bunch of fun people and are planning a reunion soon
the tuna tartar was fresh and had a great flavor with a bit of spice kick
just beware of the leprechaun on the way to the restrooms im sure ive seen him on some horror movies
i had many things on the plate which allowed me to mix into a great flavourful spoonful
restaurant decor could be a little more authentic and salsa  is definitely not the best i have had however overlooking these minor imperfections  prices are extremely reasonable and the staff is wonderful
we checked it went up to our room in the hrh tower and were greeted with a standard sized bathtub
very cool concept
we will be back again
the positive energy was so magnetic
this place is an awesome sports bar if your in the area
my family loves their tuna appetizer and their nachos are huge
the food and beverage selection is what youd expect very similar to other valley irish spots rula bula and skeptical chymist
prices were very reasonable
so the vibe is a bit off putting and the music they play makes it hard to speak with your server
well it was glued down with the cheese that should have been on my sandwich unless that was cheese from the last patron lol
but either way the burgers are excellent
you can dress up your burgers anyway you like
a delighful twist on the classics
they attempt to make up for the low quality of their sound just by making it louder
in a city with a ton of diverse dining options this would not be my first choice but it is definitely decent
i sat in the cold outside in the patio where it was empty and the weather was freezeing
the owner came out and greeted a lonely 20yearold boy me and it made me feel at home
i tried the pancit chicken adobo lumpia fried pork skin and halohalo
i just got threatened by a goon from this place i hope my review will hopefully help this establishment improve
and i mean lines for everything
after she finished stumbling through who the chefs were we were given a basket of black bean  corn rolls with a jar of chow chow  a flavored butter drizzled with honey
yet the two duo hasnt changed
my olfactory nerves were in overdrive
we had guacamole salsa and chipsthe salsa was spoiled guacamole had a half an avacodo untouched and the chips were store bought
but the mark of a good steakhouse is the steak and the filet medium rare was meltinyourmouth good and deserving of 5 stars
our waiter checked on us often
the pictures of this place really dont reflect the real life experience i had there
we got a suite at the golden nugget for the same price of their standard room here on a saturday night
comfortable and cozy atmosphere hip owner cook and waitstaff
peppermill is an institution
the menu is fantastic as well with surprisingly tasty food for a comedy shop
oysters on the half shell were good not stupendous
portions are generous
we got burgers and fries
it was 45 per shot which is fair but not exactly a bargain
they have a huge selection of draft beers
totally hit the spot
no wonder its hard to get a table here sometimes
decided to stop by and eat dinner before heading home after a long flight
it had some green cabbage some sliced fresno peppers and what i think was manchego
its kind of hidden all the way in the back of the hawaiian marketplace but the  food is really good
the only thing i dont like about this place is the cover but im not going to lie sometimes its worth it
our waiter was awesome but the hostesses working tonight are horrible
this has become our favorite place
food for all 4 was marginal and overpriced
humble yourself young man
here  women like to shop
in an interesting twist they added poutine cheese which i see as an interesting quebecmeetsjapan experiment and i respected the creativity
salad well done and tasty
the space was great we sat at a large communal table in the front and watched people scurry by in the rain
you can climb it if you want it does have spectacular views from the top and provides the feeling of self accomplishment
would avoid this place unless its a snow storm outside and you dont have any winter clothes and cant leave the westin hotel
its a pub not a gastropub so u can only expect so much
i am a girl who likes to drink and stay out but the nitty gritty is just not worth it
if youve ever had raw veggies with only lemon juice squirted on them you can imagine how underwhelming that taste experience can be which probably explains why the woman barely ate any of her salad
instead of rice i asked for a salad which they gotlettuce tomatoes without any dressing
ouvert depuis le 9 aot loc est situ dans lancienne banque molson magnifique difice construit en 1905 de style beauxarts  sainthenri
everyone loved the food
regardless i would recommend this place to anyone visiting toronto and looking for great food entertainment and a bit of cultural history
ive loved everything ive ever tried even things that i had no intention of loving im looking at you pork belly tacos
the portions were huge and the food quality is very good
im just so disappointed that someone took the jewel of leslievill and replaced it with a combination of mcdonald and kfc
make sure you download the pkwy app so you can track those beers have access to the full menu and receive alerts about special events
i really enjoyed my meal here
the food is great im in love with the trio of salas and warm fried chips
do not mind the drunken american tourists gamblin at the bar but take place on a wooden tiki table on a homemade tiki chair and watch the sticky menu
this a favorite place for friends and i to hang out
the server shari was professional and friendly
i get the dd which is the perfect amount of food to leave me satisfied and not overindulging
the muffin was delicious and the sandwich was pretty good as well
again i am a native japanese and knows about ramen probably more than the average diners there thus my criticism may sound too much and too picky but since they sell japanese style ramen i needed to say what i thought
very bad menu
so i arrives in phoenix at night after checking in  everything it was past 11pm
i have been drinking here for 4 years
nothing screamed eat me bar food or not
the only reason i didnt give them five stars is because the service is a little slow but id still go back
or a maybe good time if you have a vagin
and it took over 25 minutes
imagine having to buy rice at 400 per cup
i liked all the parts separately and for the most part they went together but sometimes i would screw it up and it wouldnt taste as good as it should
came here with a couple of friends late friday night and soon regretted not grabbing tacos instead
hooters is everything you might expect and more  if youre expecting a place that is  grungy dirty and lacking any class
we did feel a little rushed but it wasnt so bad
and ill say they werent bad
place turns up real high
theres always at least one or two nontraditional meat variety offered which is nice for my vegetarian friend or for me when i happened to come here on a lenten friday
he then comes back about half an hour later and tells us there is nothing he can do
in town for a business meeting and hoping for a good mexican restaurant nearby
we were very hungry as it was after a swim meet
the interior is unique and the patio area is welcoming
worst service we have ever experienced in a restaurant or whatever it is
the burger i ordered it medium rare came out rare but id rather go that way than the other
we stuck with appetizers only theyll fill you up
plus outside the window theres a nice view of the fountain which weve never seen
they served the wrong wine once but then didnt charge us for the mistake
didnt stay around long enough for a second round
the staff are all very sweet and happy to see me which makes me feel awesome
the mashed potatoes were a hard rock while the asparagus was perfectly grilled
it was like a mash up of latinsalsa and house
they are not trying to be rude its just the culture
many times i split the salad with someone else
the stairs though ladies be warned
people this is a chain restaurant and if you state you have eaten at others than why would you be expecting anything different
i dont drink much so i ordered the shan diego a mix of lemonade and ipa
i had a really great time
theyre a little spendybut ohsodelicious and refreshing
service  servers were quite attentive and friendly
if you love a dive bar this is for you
the food selection and presentation was great but it was a little overpriced and extremely oily i was sick the rest of the night after dinner
we have been to peru before anf this aside from the large corn was far from a resemblance
as i stood at the bar i was approached by a sweet woman something that never happens in the boondocks where i currently live whom i immediately recognized as the fiddlersinger with the band
everything is on the upper end of the price scale
first time in toronto
the bar is quite samll but there are plenty of tables but the only one free was a round one near the door
the service was excellent too
one of the best thai restaurants in las vegas and the us i have not encountered many thai restaurants that are as good as this one really crummy area but the food is worth it
i have been to the original in mexico and the relation is apples and oranges
they couldve rearranged the tables to make it work
pork and beef meatloaf was a very large portion and satisfying it needs more of the porcini mushroom drizzlethe mashed potatoes under the loaf were chunky as well but not overly buttery
its been redone to be simple warm and comforting with nice views of the ginormous fermentation tanks
ka goes for a fast 90 minutes with no intermission
got a dinner for cappicola  cheese 629 it special sandwich with spicy ham and fries  coleslaw in between the bread
when walking in was greeted by a gentleman
food was on par with the price but could have been better
my wife and i enjoyed the atmosphere a great deal
we got the poutine dog monthly special a vegan dog prepared mexican style and fries
great place to watch sports
went here for my 30 birthday to sing karaoke
huge bar couple group seating areas and the kitchen kind of separates the bar area from the dining area
im going to come back just for those though
but tonight the service was exceptional
they must have an amazing team over there for everyone to work together so well
pear naked lady drink was yummy
what else could you want
if you like motown youll definitely like this show
yes i can be a sucker marketing and ambiance
i also got the cheesy bacon fries and they had old bay seasoning on them delicious
the burger presentation was poor a bit sloppy and disappointing to the eyes
i would recommend bonus round to anyone who enjoys free arcade games and unique cocktails
complimentary admission for guys and girls
as far as food goes its a tapas place so bart suggested about 23 items per person
and what a shock to see that there were no seats
i got seated quickly and the waitress was regular johnny on the spot
cocktails  you must request some luxardo cherries
both were very tasty meaning you can actually taste the goose and makers
the beer was brewed on the premises it was great beer along with a lesson on the ingredients that were used to make the beer
didnt think it lived up to the four stars
i had a fantastic time here on my last visit
it supposedly has a good sound system but you really cant tell because the layout completely demolishes any semblance of decent acoustics
food was ok should have gone elsewhere
the wings unsauced were very spicy so just be aware
my favorite place to eat whenever i am in vegas
i have also had pasta at this restaurant and its very good too
just tell them any alcohol you prefer sweet or savory and fruit and theyll make you a delicious drink
they will also give you a pager to notify you when your table is available
we plan on going back for sure
concept as none of us are golfers we chose to all hit 20 balls each in 5 ball intervals
no elvis no 5inch heels no oceans 11 suits
i ordered the chicken sandwich has a fancier name but wasnt memorable so i forgot and it came with only a little chicken
the biggest thing i noticed was that there were literally only teenagers working there so that probably plays a big role in the lackluster service
our server dillion who might have also been the owner was very accommodating and down to earth someone youd like to go support
during the 3rd quarter of what was arguably the biggest game of the year our tv went out because nobody could locate a remote to stop the timing out of the receiver
margaritas at pink taco were 10ea and at rehab it was 13
even service was only average
the manager of that particular location not this one here wrote her back explaining their ingredients pricing structure etc
he ordered the milanesa de pollo and the chicken was very moist and perfectly cooked
all of the reviews that at above 1 star is a joke
i always tell my husband that we should drop in to the union square mm restaurant just for dessert
i had a delicious meat omelette and my husband enjoyed the sausage bowl and we shared the cinnamon roll pancake which was to die for
they were all great
the hostess outside was less than inviting about the issue as well
last time we went in there they were all donating their time and the food cost only whatever donation you chose to give
this was 1112014 the 2nd night of phish for dinner
i am still recovering from the last one i had a week ago
i used to recommend this place and now i refuse to because of the poor service
best spot in town for late night 2 on weekdays 3 in weekend
nice amount of chicken and ingredients
the decor music and endless drink selection make this one of the best places in phoenix
leave happy
so ultimately i just sat up really straight and tried not to curse too much
one of our favorite restaurants
jennifer the bartender is friendly and goes above and beyond to make our nights great
so glad i went with her suggestion
my favorite thai food in the freaking usa
live music which is always fun
great place for a date
i loved this place
the servers are super friendly and talkative
i had the fish  chips and my wife had the shepherds pie  both enjoyable
we were also told there was a private event on the 3rd level
tough to figure out the parking there though so be prepared to drive around a bit or get lost coming and going from the underground lots
we got through the entire plate of chips and sat there staring at the empty bowl until we we were able to flag a server down not the one who was supposed to be our main server she was still at the computer and got a refill
the carrots beans and brussel sprouts salad topped with shrimp was fine but again totally forgettable
you come to socialize
the server was trying to charge us for drinks that we purchased from the bar so the billing process was very messy time consuming  frustrating
we ordered the mediterranean platter so good
i felt like someone took some lime juice in one of those cute little bottles and poured it into a shot and said hey that should be a 12 shot
it took a while for anyone to come to the hostess stand and seat us
worth a visit
we sat at the bar while waiting on a table outside bartenders were very friendly but not very up to date with what seasonal beers they had on tap
often a place we were seen post dinner prebar 11 which isnt in the yelp listings but worth finding if its still there and were many billiards were shot shots taken and songs chosen from a jukebox
the music is good too trad wins my heart every time
sent a friend here on her birthday and only got rave reviews in response
ive been obsessed with this place since my first visit and return anytime im craving a big juicy burger
sure it was not nearly as nice as this one but at least that one was a legitimate college bar
when i asked her why only certain items had 50 off she said she made a mistake and it was only certain items
we had it boxed up and will serve it to our dogs
every single guest that attended was extremely pleased with the prompt service
the daybeds have built in storage bins where you can throw in bags etc
ive been there loads of times for dinner and drinks and the staff are so snooty  too snooty for their own good
i think there must be about 5 seats in the bar in total scattered round the outskirts
the texas cheese fries and margarita grilled chicken are my favorites here
service was quick and our waiter was friendly
we were told that this cake was not made here but it is still worth ordering
so the place didnt turn into a bacchanalia of alternative music dancing emulating the beautiful siouxsie sioux and tortured early new order
we were here for my husbands birthday and instead of one dessert for him they brought out two second was complimentary
but we didnt start golfing until after noon and after noon they change the pricing tier up by 15
mike ordered his burger and i only had room for sweet potato fries both were delicious
our waitress olivia was good as well
get it if you like dirtydogs
the 1st was in austin tx
i said the garden would be nice
the burger was cooked perfectly the gravy was great and it came with all the same sides as the corned beef hash
sie war zu laut
if i do come back i will probably have to try something else
after visiting the andy warhol museum we went to cultural district for dinner
the mini peruvian burritos with lomo saltado were savoury and tasty with the first few bites but the saltiness became unbearable
burgers were not bad
you cant get this anywhere else and the mix of flavors and textures in this pasta dish are unbelievable in your mouth
food is quite good given the inherent limitations of british cuisine
after staring in disbelief for a bit he just walked away
the outside patio is probably the best place to sit
the brat was juicy and tender sitting on a poppy seed bun
from the moment you walk in the door this place captures you with their atmosphere
will definitely be coming back next time im in town
what i would say is that the staff without prompting saw she hadnt really eaten it and asked what was wrong to which she explained she was offered alternatives but declined and again without prompting they took her good off the bill which was very good of them
the food started off good  the scones were super moist and chewy
i highly recommend trying the seasonal soups i have tried about 4 different ones so far and have savored each one
they have garnishes from bacon to oysters to capresse skewers to beets to gouda
my friend hosted her birthday here since last time we bowled was in o7 but gnats minus the point
the place is yes pricey but it was an experience
nachos were different but still tastey
this place didnt look too spacious when we walked in but they have plenty of space
its nice the patio part of restaurant in airport hall was spacious
today we walked outta taco guild
went on a friday night with a group of friends
oh well till next time vegas
crab cakes are unreal
the food has always been the best i have had in the phoenix area
get some new ideas folks
that was really unexpected
when we got our sandwich we were so glad that it was ordered to share cuz the portion was huge
got a quesadilla and the cheese was cold
one of the best outdoor dining experiences in phoenix
it would be the only reason keeping me from visiting this place again
everyone who works there always seems to be in a good mood
having moved away from arizona i can say i miss la bocca as i introduced several friends to the hot spot and they are constantly rubbing my nose in the fact that they just checked in to la bocca
i went here a couple of weeks ago for a hip hop karaoke show and it was absolutely amazing
it gets very very busy and its not a large place
except for the grilled fish tacos
if its your first time pure is worth checking out at least once but get there early enough for guest list
they forgot the cheese but it didnt need it
oh well we learned one lessonthe results of a democratic voting process doesnt always give you the best choice
they turned to the channel and they just didnt want to pay for it
at those prices the entrees do not come with salad or even bread
wood bar wood support posts wooden walls wooden booths
plus we could not converse
they have a decaf that in my opinion trumps their caffeinated varieties which i understand is do in part to the careful work done by one of the owners who cant consume caffeine
on both trips the evening was ruined and going here was a complete waste of time and total disappointment
it was super messy but thats the experience for you
was told those could not be reserved ahead of time but to just go down there right when they open the pools at 9 and choose whichever ones we wanted and we would be charged 60 per chair and they would be ours for the day
the broth was savory and delicious
the wine selection is out of this world  a must go
we went back the night before i left just so i could have another for the road
word around the office was that this place was nicegreat patiogood food
i didnt pay attention to the bread thinking it would be a regular ole type of sandwich bread
she saw it talked about online and we were bored
the bar area was full though
i got a burger that was supposed to have smoked gouda on it and instead it had shredded cheddar and was almost raw
i have to agree with nicole on her review
sometimes its hard to concentrate on vp when youre eyeing the dealers going by
the fish sandwich was the worst i have ever had
i dont know why its such a fantastic sammy but trust it is
this hotel features 270000 guest rooms
but the people i know who have eaten there and tried most of the food options tell me the food quality is good
celebrated my wifes birthday here wife daughter and i had a wonderful evening
one of the reasons i visited las vegas last week was to eat at cut
they have a tasty drink menu as well
all my favorite music made it all feel good
we decided to try crust based on the good yelp reviews
talked to a promoter who got myself and 5 other guys onto a guest list
her response was i just had a table of 13 sit down and i am busy i completely understand being busy but what is she trying to say that the table if 13 is more important than a client that lives in the area and would potentially be a returning customer is as important as a table of 13 the manager asked if there was anything he could do to make it up to me but i said i need a few mins and then he sent over another server to take heathers place
she told me she would be sure we werent and i figured all was well are you getting that sinking feeling that perhaps i was wrong to think that
not to mention off the track betting for gamblers
finallydont expect to walk in and buy your usual style of toiletries
this was a oneanddone
wish we could have taken randy back to the east coast with us
they have outdoor seating as well which is covered
how bad can a place be when the best parts of your celebration dinner was the excellent  souvenir photo that we purchased and the wine other than that there is absolutely nothing else positive to say
major dipping action
the restaurant was ill prepared for our 17h45 reservation time with it taking twenty minutes to receive our drinks keeping in mind we were one of two tables
service was sometimes good sometimes bad
also as a red card member ive gotten tons of promotions and deals because we choose to play at the wynn
this stuff is mostly madetoorder and it takes time
the atmosphere was great
the husband ordered the bangers and mash and i got the cornish pastie
they were ok the firecracker wings were also pretty good but nothing spectacular
overall i might have stopped back her for the omega 3 but given the terrible management and the week staff i probably wont ever be back
needless to say i wont be returning and neither will anyone of my family members
i ordered a coffee and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and wheat toast
the adult bar area is very small but nice and is open with kids running and screaming by
to start it comes in a fancy kind of diagonally cut egg shell bowl great presentation
usually when you order nachos youre bound to get a soggy chip here and there from all the toppings but these ones were all soggy and not crispy at all
i wish i could have eaten more
you will barely be able to hear your dinner companions
its been two years and i forgot exactly what we ate but it was some kind of meal that had a little of all their popular dishes
their staff was quick and attentive
service was excellent though
beware of the bartender made hats
very welcoming atmosphere and experience
if not avoid at all costs
i think different rooms play different music
i got up from my seat and found another waiter and requested my check
my husband and i ate here on friday for lunch
not spicy but not necessarily mild
they keep the lights nice and low so you can just come in take a load off
to me its a 35 ive been looking for places like this for a long time
she then at the cash register gives me some bs about how we would have known right away if it was bad and know shes charging us for one person 20 dollars
or aok quite describe it
however it is not a stuck up scene there are lots of regular people just there to enjoy a drink and hang out with friends
this review is just for my mealnothing else
it wasnt busy tonight so i was happy that i wouldnt have to wait or squeeze through the large crowds
would get again
the content of the show varies
it is delicious and dangerous at the same time
almost made up for horrible meal at pink taco the night before
the belgium waffle hit the spot
i ask for the manager and the manager insists i had agreed to it and it was on the voucher
especially the pan roast
the owner jeremy is always hanging out at the bar making sure everyone is taken care of and happy and the servers are all awesome
the amount of noise was deafening in what should have been a more relaxed atmosphere
music is definitely for the young at heart
2 for 1 during happy hour  they literally bring you two of what you order
i ordered a mango martini of some sort to start
so i really did not care for this class at all
service was with a smile
youve got to run your smart phone flashlight to see the menu
the karaoke is a lot of fun and overall there were some really good singers that were fun to listen to
we bought our tickets 3 the day of the show and called in to reserve a table with a bottle
so first time here
and the biggest factor for me that night drum roll pleasethe music
first the actual building is one of the most beautiful i have ever seen a nice break from the standard vegas hotel architecture
businesses align the walk way specialty sellers that include  a place selling frozen daqueries socks for 10 a pair sparkly jewelry and lord knows what else its a mega mall of the best people watching ive ever seen
i wasnt too happy so i changed to the carne asada ranchero
we started with a gnocchi appetizer eggplanttomatomozzarella appetizer and spring rolls
my favorites are of course the shark as well as the black mole and one of the beef ones not the sonoran
drinks are very expensive
very different atmosphere and very limited menu
it is as good if not better than postinos without a two hour wait
restaurant is dark as hell their servers look like they want to kill themselves and hate the fact that theyre working there only reason ppl go there is by default because of the convenience and their wing night which they are increasing in price progressively have you ever watched a bar scene in a mob movie thats set in the 70s
i normally get the ribeye there which they season and cook just right i order mine rare
wait too long
the waitresses are usually very friendly and offer great service
to top off the perfect steak they have a very large selection of sides including multiple preparations of mac and cheese potatoes and corn all of which at least matched if not bested mastros quality and definitely price
the ambience is great and the best part is that i didnt have to wait 2 hours to get a table as you would with any decent place these days
we will definately put this on our list of prefered places to dine
we really were excited to try el dorado cantina
what a rip off
offers veggie options seafood steak chicken you name it
tucked away at the bottom of the atwater market literally in the canal this refurbished dinner boat is the first floating cafbar to grace the montral scene
this review is long overdue and almost joined rain by also falling into obscurity
i couldnt weigh it because it didnt come with the scales
i found this less intense and i had less anxiety about this then when doing actual dance lessons
wife got the burger and it tasted great as well with good crispy fried
where did all of the urban professionals run to in central phx
this place is not marketing itself correctly at all
there were 2 other groups eating
so happy that this is right in our awesome new neighborhood and we will definitely be coming back to check out even more of the huge menu
and this had maybe 5 sheets
the lady silvia is a perfect place to come with a group of 4  6 friends who want to relax enjoy some conversation on some uber cool couches and have some good drinksthe pictures do not begin to do justice to the decor inside
this place has other yum things on the menu but if its your first time go with my recommendation
as were leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldnt control laughing
not all wait staff seemed to have the same level of attentiveness as they hung out at the hostess table for large parts of the night
hosted my birthday party there and the service was outstanding
food wise it is top notch with tasty food choices including a bit of healthy choices
nur dann auf nummer sicher mit reservierung
they come with a spicy aioli that is fantastic
this was our first cirque but second cirquetype show
love the oakcrest
i love the combo plate and another delicious meal is the salmon enchiladas
whenever i m in toronto i will first go there
90 beers on tap with a large percentage of local and pa drafts
we won the drinks round once
the service was excellent and the place was immaculate
i ordered a burger with a salad as my side
food is only okay overpriced and portion sizes are tiny
as good as gallo blanco and hulas
the menu is confusing just in the read then when you get this plate of confusion fusion well it just leaves too much on the plate
des orchestres live jouent aussi le week end
the pool was about 6 inches deep and it was a pretty decent size where if you werent looking at where youre walking youll easity fall in
for a 4 hour party the food lasted for only 1 hour
just left here with my boyfriend
most likely 23 times
i told him i was there to write about the nights event and the cheeky la las for the las vegas burlesque blog
if there was a problem with our outfits she couldve told us
shes like okay so nothing else
luckily  i was early so i was able to find a spot
i would seriously call that night and then the next day to lie about not getting our appetizer
i am in the service industry and it seriously takes a lot for me to complain or even get on yelp and write a review but someone who is in management should lead by example
at the end of the meal neither of us had finished more than half of our plate
the bartenders were all great
someone on the train recommended this place
we arrived early to have a drink at the bar and i had the usual glass of wine and my boyfriend tried one of their newer drinks on the menu the blackberry gin lemonade
the weather was perfect this year but they were even prepared with industrial sized fans in some walkways to cool people down
okay of course the people in lux werent hackers
amazing vibe great venue right on the water in the newly developed east bank of the flats
if you are looking for a bar with a great selection of craft beer then this is probably not your place
i am on a salad kick and therefore ordered the kale and sweet potato salad with the salmon on top and since i was hungry yesterdays soup chicken tortilla that day the crunchy bits in the salad are pomegranate and overall it was a tasty and filling salad and salmon had a nice flaky crusty finish that seems like the result of sweet glaze that i would love to replicate
the daytime bartender tina is a sassy broad  made me feel like a regular  took the time to make menu suggestions
the prices are very reasonable and this place is awesome
i cant say enough about this gem
365 beers from their rotating happy hour list
i shouldnt have to wait 15 min
the second one had good sound was technically proficient moved around and the first thing i thought to myself was these guys must be heavily influenced by incubus
i would definitely come back
even after my father complained about the service she didnt even say im sorry
and for those who likes quite peaceful dining experience it is worth a try
you still want it
if you come during happy hour the prices arent too bad at all
i was informed that the restaurants menu changes everyday according to what is at the farm and that they use all fresh ingredients to make their dishes
my group was super happy to find this cool little spot
i just love this place
i told the host that theres no people inside the restaurant and theres no server to check if we wanted to order
i like one fact a lot that they r not very fuzzy about  where to keep ur slippers cover ups etc  most of the time you can just keep them near the pool  with all this pros  i felt music was not great
the size is perfect and you have options of how you want to view the show
lots of outgoing people and live music
i have visited the arizona event center on numerous occasions and seen alot of different genres of entertainment everything from mixed martial arts  poker tournaments hiphop shows rock shows you name it
we were there for lunch and all had something different
i had it on my pizza and lemme tell youyou cant go wrong with this
there were people with a couple of kids there too
extremely friendly and attentive during the entire meal
price i would say the alcohol was pretty expensive
all that steak and not a single good cut to be found anywhere in this house
the signage in the parking garage is bad or drivers arent too bright because a lot of people were exiting through the entrance and driving down the wrong way
we should have went  to the livingroom in chandler where there are classy people instead it costed us 55000 for dinner
i would always suggest brio as an option to my out of town friends
a huge talent
i had heard a lot of hype about delux and thought that i ought to give it a try to see if it could hold up to my dads famous gerrick burger  ingredients are secret
there is a huge difference
i love this place
we passed the time by drinking beer watching the only waiter an old vietnamese man hobble around the restaurant and wondering if this happens every time the kitchen gets cleaned
i imagine over time and with some fine tuning they will audit their menu and update then offering their most successful dishes
or just that one jackass bounce who acted too good to answer our simple questions
i expected fresh slices of smoked salmon not overpriced canned food
the food is good and the service is always friendly
i really wanted to eat something irish and i was able to from their special st paddys day menu
troy the manager was so friendly and helpful and our bartender was the best
im not going back
the only things that were decent were the drinks and the large fortune cookie for dessert
it says not offered during arena eventsthe arena is like way behind the hotel
menu is edible
i walked over to them as the hostess seated the group of four and explained to the young guy that we had already put our name down with the hostess and had been waiting for almost 20 minutes now
water level was always above half and both as a team were super friendly
we had the shrimp stuff with crab chopped salad chicken pram and mr cs burger
so the atmosphere was more like a buffalo wild wings than what im sure this place is usually like
i ordered a salad with grilled chicken
they play the worst pop music known to man kind its like listening to backstreet boys and nickleback on repeat
extremely overpriced crowds were crazy i was just happy i got out of this place with my shirt on my wallet was almost stolen while i was sitting at the bar customer service was no help whatsoever the girls that i saw were not very good this place is too ghetto blush is still better and i dont even like blush
and we waited a long time for a server to just bring us waters
why not just give her a new one
they did  add a couple of lighter option since my last trip the lobster roll being one of them
you want food youve got your choice of bags of chips peanuts or some smokies
i was however surprised that he did not go around and see how the customers are doing
both doors were locked
they seemed to have a lot of beers on tap id guess 10 including big rock so i was a fan
this is the 3rd or 4th in just a few years
the setting  especially for north olmsted  is awesome
taco platters include 3 tacos corn or flour rice and beans
the artisan menu has some unique items that you wouldnt find at any ordinary pizza shop
i did try a slice of the black frances
however for a great happy hour drinking with friend taking advantage of arizona weather this is  a great place
i think the place has gone down hill
my fianc had a southwest chicken wrap which was a bit above average
i asked her if i decided to upgrade would the bartender just pour the shot on top of my already crappy margarita and she said yes
but its not the night girls coz we got some 2 strict watchmen in tha  house
oh i can give you your small change if you really want it  oh really
or ask greg hes happy to make suggestions
whenever we are in the area we stop in for a beer and a pretzel
the food here is really good
the only good part was the dj and the bartender
all super friendly
3 bartenders working kept up with the crowded bar despite how busy they were
its looking a bit neglected and soiled
i also love to go there on dates
went inside to ask worker 1 to sit in the patio and mentioned we had a dog
i ordered my drink while waiting for hubby
this place wasnt far from our hotel when i looked up restaurants on yelp and as soon as we drove up i saw the hanging lights and from then i already knew i was gonna like it inside
well the flavors were not limited
we walk there often for food or drinks the inside could use a little updating  outside seating would be a nice addition but the food is excellent
and just fyi there are plenty of things at red lobster that arent that great either but as far as soup goes they win  the breading on everything wasnt too bad but a lot of the fried items were bland and definitely needed more seasoning in their breadingbatter
the chicken meatballs were sent to us by accident but the waiter asked us to go ahead and try them on the house
about 2 days  prior to actual dinner a conformation text is sent with explicit mention of their dress code
she asked if i needed a coffee refill and said it would be refilled
i cannot come up with a single negative comment about our dining experience at fahrenheit
i was very happy with the set up and nostalgic vibe of the place too
the wings are really good and they might have the best pretzels with cheese ive ever had at a bar
and wine is 5 a glass every day from 115pm
beat any ny steakhouse in recent memory
it was not bad but kudos to whoever writes the copy for the menu
now in order to have a successful and popular coffee shop many aspects come into play
im definitely coming back and im looking forward to trying the other dishes
i sat for 15 min waiting to get my drink order then waited even longer for a cup of soup
generous portions of meat and veggies
we had prime seats and could easily see everything there were also people flying above us
we checked in the first day and had to get a room with one bed instead if the two we booked for
we had great service by our server tom and other waitstaff
our winning streak continued with our food because i ordered the flat iron burger that comes with bacon and bbq sauce
this was our my wife and i first trip to the 5th quarter but its going to be the first of many
second it is filled with quality ingredients
max was truly impressed and enjoyed this show a great deal in which i think most tourists would have similar reactions
i hate to do this and this is my first yelp review but this needs to be said
despite the fact that vegas has a stupid number of locals tavern type places per capita arguably way too many big dogs gets 2 thumbs up from me for their large creative menu
the burgundy lion isnt particularly remarkable but it serves its purpose as a neighbourhood pub with a good menu
the coleslaw that came with the ribs seemed like more of a garnish than an actual coleslaw
our server had kept track of who had ordered what
7 they have live music
for being so far off the strip and charging so much you would think the room would be unbelievably amazing
we had to hail down waiters for refills not great for customer service so shame on you yard house for that good job cooks
as stated by others the prices are absolutely reasonable and selection decent
girls walk around soliciting dances but the ones i saw were polite took their time and handled rejection politely
after having dinner at a nearby restaurant our group decided to go for some drinks
i hesitated for a second not sure what to say
wilted salad disgusting
my recommendation is get dropped off by uber or a friend or cough up the 20 for valet parking
well after witnessing a beat down delivered by an employee against a patron i honestly dont have anything good to say about this place
as i dont live in az if im going to be away for an extended period of time im always sure to take a bag of their freshlyroasted coffee beans from wherever with me
this comes with a cheese blend which i always ask for no cheese so i cant review it bacon sauteed onions and arugula
this place has outside the box spins on topping your pie
fyi 23 for a beer angry orchard and a shot isnt a lot
keep it up guys and gals
this place was very small and almost impossibly dark
the only hiccup was with the meal progression as a salad and beer were slow to appear at our tablebut proper meal progression seems to be elusive at many of restaurants we visit these days
i went here the past friday
my fianc and i went here last night for dinner
if you havent recently been to fremont street in downtown vegas then you dont know what youve been missing
it was good but not great or anything to write home about
this was pretty nasty
well slap me silly and call me susan this stuff is bomb
great drink and beer selection
the tvs were high enough and placed well so you could watch the games you were interested in
freemont street does
the service was fast and friendly the few times ive been there
i had mac  cheese with sausage
the cut was good and tender order the chimichurri sauce to go with it
i witnessed waitresses and waiters chitchatting and 3 hostesses standing around while they could be helping
the highlight of our meal was eating their fried rice and miso seabass
its particularly difficult to parse the fight scene where the stage is positioned such that the audience has an overhead view but leaping back and forth is probably all thats really safe in that situation
my experience here was great
a bit late to my liking but we were determined to try this brunch
customer service was outstanding
the goses were our favorites of the many we tried
is the pecan pie homemade
it seemed like our waiter took forever and ever to return to our table after taking our order leaving to grab drinks and the like
on the side away from the bar it has normal tables while the bar area has service at the bar and at those tall tables that require high chairs to sit at
it used to be special
theres a dance floor in the back but there was no dancing going on while we were there
beans were dry and potatoes were decent
ive eaten pretty much majority of the popular items in the menu but today i only ordered two
its like christmas and freshly fallen snow and ice skaters and a roaring fire all wrapped up in a glass with tequila
food it is always fresh hot and made to order
it is not authentic mexican because it has an additional exotic taste to it that i cant put my finger on
my friends martini was more like a shot
2 theres unassuming but friendly crowd
meltycheesyjuicy full of flavor oh my gosh
highly recommend 6 for the entree i received chicken scallopini
they have an amazing selection of different omelets bacon meat  cheese or the roasted turkey are my favorites they give you the option of cottage cheese and their dd hashdont get me started
you enter what feels like a secret door and venture up a flight of stairs
the other 3 members of my party thought their food was better than mine so maybe i just ordered the wrong thing
also the food was great and the beer was awesome so everything about this place was overly pleasant
other than this its actually a lovely little restaurant quite small though
ill return on my next visit to vegas
the menu which is a small ingredientdriven menu at the moment consists of 34 appies snacks and mains which is set to expand as they grow
they seated us within five minutes i think its because we made reservations in a room to the left of the entrance
it gets packed in there when its at its peak hours
spent many a nights  here with friends and family shooting pool darts and spending too much money on the jukebox
the chicken chimichanga is also really good  i highly recommend it
le menu est vari et trs original
he started to walk away with my card i guess to refund it but i asked for the card and turned around and left left since my sister was already thrown out
first of all im all of 52 and the wall dividing us and this table hes refering to is like 45
came here for this first time last month while visiting my in laws they rave about this place so i agreed to give it a try
i love coming here
we were going to go across the street to the beauty bar but there was a fight and welooked across the street and heard some bumping music and a cool mix of genres
the menu is small but has a variety of alcohol from all over the world
such a nice pub to make a stop at on a cold day
the owner was there meeting patrons and he was very friendly
hubby loved his pasta with prosciutto  black truffle cream saucemy simple roasted chicken was boring and uninspiredthe only saving grace for this dish was the smoked mash which was quite delightful although a little on the cool side temp wise the atmosphere is nice and dark perfect if you have an ugly date
the dessert i was hoping to get was reserved for those ordering a special dinner that night and when i ordered a glass of a dry red wine thats a bit oaky i ended up with a somewhat sweet cabernet
its usually pretty busy on the weekends and youll probably have to wait a while to get a table but thats expected with melt and the wait is usually worth your time
this is a real burlesque show like you see in the movies
my friend only said her bloody orange margarita was a lot sweeter than my margarita
my boyfriend and i both ordered the special alaskan king crab legs caught by the people from the deadliest catch
and if you do i highly recommend you eat and drink european
but instead i was greeted at the front door with hugs and the service continued to be warm friendly and inviting
very clean quiet and perfect snacks
its a little uncomfortable
highly recommend this place whether you are going before a game or even if you are just in the area
will definitely return
and any place that serves tall cans of pbr to go with my food is a great place to me
if you are a big eater i dont think this is the place for you but if you are into having small bites and not belly busters definitely stop in for a drink and slider
i wanted something out the norm where i wouldnt run into people with a familiar face
they will hold your table for 15minutes past the reservation
the burgers ive had there are comparable to elsewhere
excellent food knowledgeable sommelier elegant atmosphere
was here with my friend here last night
pipers is one of my favorite places in pittsburgh
place is always happening and the food is great
what a great find
bier market has a great collection of beers
this is a place with decent service a limited amount of choices of horrible ambiance
four seasons session pale ale is the beer i enjoy when here
we ordered 3 different appetizers to share and 2 rounds of sangria pitchers for all of us combined
life does get better when eating drinking and meeting all the cool staff at taco guild
the hostess mentioned who our server would be but apparently she was slammed so the host ended up being our server
its a great open room with bright green carpeting a dance floor bathrooms and a bar
not very busy
i know i did
anyway if your like me and want a good experience from a family restaurant id rethink this place
more power to them to draw people to whitney way though
big enough for a group to share
that that drunk dumbies
the staff was fun and inviting
dieters and supermodels stay awaythere is nothing for you here
i foresee myself going there again
its a pretty big area so not too crowded
the waitress had no clue what i was talking about and said they probably didnt have it
few hours ago we went there as a family night out
it arrived on a large white plate with nothing on it but a sliced chicken breast a chicken leg and essentially a chopped garnish of picked corn bacon etc
missing two teeth and three days to graduation i of course panicked
my only complaint about this place would be that i think the prices are way too high for lunch
a solid place to hang out
went there for drinks with a friend who was visiting toronto
chicken wings b totally typical wings
the atmosphere is a bit crazy
im convinced its xs angels sending me down a vegas miracle
the happy hour specials are great some fabulous bands have graced the tiny stage and once a wily dart landed in my fro and stuck there
their is an indoor and outdoor section with heaters for the winter and its covered for summer shade
its eight pieces of steamed dumplings
we got our food quick thx chef and it was great
drinks are affordably priced i love the live music on weekends
theres two mathers bars in edinburghjust to confuse everyone
i come with coworkers on a weekly basis and enjoy phenominal service from genesis and the other girls at the bar every time
ordered the ab burger with bacon
i had a really great lunch experience here
lots of beers on tap and sometime there is live music which definitely adds to the draw
the food was on point well executed and the progression was perfect
we recently have been ordering off the food menu and love the smoked meat sandwich which comes with chips 9 and the layered dip with tostitos8
other than that no cons
from the salsa bean dip and fried onionsjalapeos they bring before the meal to the great enchiladas juans is hands down the best mexican food in vegas
they had some loud live music maybe it is my age speaking but why must live music be so loud
great knowledgeable staff taste bud explosion must do when in phoenix go on weeknight if possible
it had lots of parmesan cheese and garlic
i validated it and everything appeared correct but when i went to leave the parking machine said that i owed 10
even though we were incredibly full we saw the table next to us order a dish full of what looked like chocolate mousse and immediately told our waitress we wanted that for dessert
the food is sloppy
we got there a little early and the bar area was already packed
this was a surprising dish really well composed and perfectly executed
i ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with homemade chips and it was as good as i could hope for
a must do on any vegas vacation but definitely not a family friendly environment
first of all we never got called for our table
it looked pretty cool from the outside  trendy hookah bar set up on the patio etc
not the best ramen ive had in my life but the overall meal and experience was solid
great pastries and coffee
they did some fun games and they did some things for me for my birthday
i could make a comment on the service being a tiny bit slowbut they were slammed when we walked in
there arent a lot of great patios in the area with all the condos that are going up
if they had asked for it during the initial phone conversation to begin with i would have been happy to provide them that information
ill try one of the flatbreads and perhaps a salad before i shut the door on this garage
the crust was thin and cooked perfectly
we also ordered the chinese jackfruit ones which were a completely different flavor tangy and delicious
we would get waters or our drinks but then end up staring at each other since there was no waiter around
your alcoholinfused bellybusting milkshakes
but it just bothered me a little bit
the coffee and breakfast items are really good
it was served with hashbrowns and fruit and both were excellent
the service was fine other than the food taking forever but maybe thats just because its so new they are still trying to work out all the kinks
the shepherds pie came with a soup spoon but i have no idea why there was no gravy at all and the mashed potatoes were dry and cold
tonight for apps we had two our pizza was the di fara special a square red pie with handcut pepperoni fresh  aged mozzarella grana padano fresh basil evoo  a nyc legend served brooklyn style edges are chared
about a month or two prior i was in new york and had visited one of their locations twice to try a bit of everything
wed only had maybe 10 fries out of it
my two friends then went there for drinks and they said the service was horrible which i fairly agreed with
the guys seemed kinda douchy and into themselves but some were so sweet i talked to one afterward to compliment his dancing skills  he crunched in the show and it was really good
i am huge fan of phoenixs move in using house for restaurantsgreat examples include cibo fate and so on authentic dartboards  no electronic
big and crispy
il y a tellement de meilleurs choix  montral
the manager who served us did not catch his name however was very friendly and attentive
after a 30 minute wait the manager comes to tell us that hes out of it with no apology or no offer to make amends in any small way
ambiance is great service on point and food was great
everything we got we didnt like
the atmosphere is positive and jessie and chris are the coolest bartenders in town
our cocktails were expertly mixed and the drink menu is primarily craft cocktails
stopped for drinks and appetizers friday around 9 pm
if this is any indication of how customers are treated at picassos rest assured that members of my party took note and will spread the word
the casino dealers and pit bosses are nice as well
wanting to brings friends from out of town out for dinner we chose one of our favourites
its upper end prices and ive never had anything but prime rib but its always fabulous
i had the caribbean jerk and the parmesan
so i ate the part of my steak i could and my husband who is definitely a red meat eater suffered through his over cooked meal
the food was fantastic
we decided to come here mainly because it was close to us and we didnt feel like walking to far
i have to dock a star though for the creme caramel cheescake which i expected to be a standout
the line was not that long there was diverse groups of people but it was more low end compared to jet
most the seafood seemed to have a sour taste and not very fresh
for a real dinner
spontaneity kicked in
its more of a loungy place i would recommend it for people who just want to chill with friends and i would recommend if ur getting a table to get it upstairs its outside and pretty
short ribs and calamari excellent
there was a lot of space to move around and dance
looking around we saw trash on the floor dirty tables we literally couldnt find a clean one a dirty fooddrink stationit was bad
then the baby was sat on the window where the cooks put the food for the waiters to take to customers
thanks for the offer for us to stay  but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth
waited about 15 minutes to get a booth seat
good 5 craft cocktail specials though were a good deal
when i told him he had said we could pay on the internet on the day of he backtracked and said we could but only if we paid by noon that day
the reason for the two star rating opposed to a one star rating is that i can imagine this to be a good stop for anyone after a night of partying looking for a slice of pizza
thursday spot drinks are 4 great deal avoid the bspot if its a casual night
food was good
the fresh berries were simple but outstanding
i came here invited and didnt know what to expect but i couldnt been more surprised
the night i went there was a private party so i didnt get to see the cool stuff in the back but i will be going back
you can tell that the salsa is homemade so it was a nice start to our meal
people are so nice and friendly
we were seated immediately and handed an ipad complete with drink menu which i thought was innovative and fun
edinburgh students are quite lucky to have two unions practically opposite each other but to be honest it would be just fine if it was only teviot
there is the cutest non starbucks coffee shop and restaurants inside
the space is gorgeous and well decorated
a beautiful and historic venue in downtown toronto
he had an attitude the moment he came to our table and it never got better
really excited to try ethiopian because i never had it before
because we had waited so long we had stopped for drinks and an appetizer earlier in the evening so we were not interested in a huge meal
normally i would have just tipped the bartender the different in amount but she was too dull to process that concept
out of 4 beers
we agreed that the flatbreads were probably only worth it during happy hour
i cant wait to come back
my friend um yes it does
my family ordered the shepherds pie hells kitchen burger and chopped salad
they were nice though and brought me a hot coffee finally
i feel like this will soon give it a few years become the replacement for barneys on university rip just because of how easy it is to get to
the food was descent but i will have to come back and try their other menu options
burgers wings sandwiches and other items are on the menu
their warm basket of bread appetizer was a real treat
i am all about local sustainable and healthy eating and when my girlfriend suggested this place even though i doubted it would be very authentic i agreed to try it
though everything comes in a small portion you would be surprised at how full you get at the end of it all
i will be back to try the pizza get another salad and ask if jimmy is around
wow factor its true
with the touch of  the owner coming around the table and made sure that everything is going good
service is average on all my visits
manager todd was not friendly or helpful
great selection of beer
this is my 2nd time here
and maybe its just because charcuterie is everywhere right now but there wasnt anything about black hoofs that stood out
doesnt really look like a restaurant either if we hadnt been seeking it out we probably wouldnt have noticed it
i really enjoyed the compotes berry was the best then they also had a kiwi and peachtangerine that were both yummy on the popovers
everyone has to order something
i actually preferred the burgers at blt burger better
best burger in tempe
sorry  no happy hour tonight was the response when i asked about the bill
id come back with a bigger group of friends
i told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didnt
and i had remembered reading a glowing review of the turkey burger here so i wanted to give it a nibble
as for food i tried the chicken tenders
its just a blast all around
you would think you would get your moneys worth right
i was absolutely stuffed by the time i was finished couldnt quite get through the whole plate
they switched from alterra to roasting their own beans in house a year or so ago and are starting to hit their stride
lebanons pub and dining scene
my burger and the wifeys burger were basically raw
dont know if ill try again
there was a five minute wait then the host took us to our table
as the youngsters that we are some of us more than others it was nice to step out to a sophisticated local for a change
the music at both levels were pretty good the atmosphere everyone was having a blast
asked my husband how much parmesan he would like and after he replied just a little she proceeds to dump a scoop full of it in the center of his pasta
they didnt have a reservation the waiter didnt ask us if we wanted appetizers although he asked the table behind us
if you check in on yelp you get a free dole whip which i obviously recommended
what looked to be a brioche bun was soft and held the burger up nicely
sometimes music is too loud
at least the beer is still good so ill give em that
maybe thats why they changed the name because customers were shocked by the high striplike prices
the steaks are really good there
upon resolving the initial hostess and water issue we were approached by a bar attendant
had a fantastic meal there
the service wasnt the best our server couldnt have any less time for us
this was listed as having some of the best drinks in town but i actually liked red square better
the pasta made in house and isnt drenched in sauce you can taste every ingredient
s izzo you must surely work at jr that is the only rationale i have well that and the shameless plug to the jrs website and knowing the waitresses name
the staff went above and beyond to ensure that i was well taken care of
i was surprised to see the bulldawgs food truck outside of what used to be a tuxedo rental shop in the not to distance past
seriously one of the best clubs in vegas
they also have really amazing early morning country fried steak
we had the 3course prw menu as well as a dessert including dim sum pork belly bites orange chili garlic ginger confit chicken wings w herbed buttermilk small plates steam bun  mortadella  bread  butter pickles  coriander mustard charred endive  dill pesto  cured pork jowl  caraway gastrique  herb bread crumbs large plates smoked brisket kohlrabi thousand island sabayon pickled red onions horseradish cream baguette roasted pork ramen mushrooms carrot 5 minute egg tonkatsu broth dessert chocolate mousse with caramel and a macaroon crumble i could give you the playbyplay of each dish but i dont have to suffice to say we finished every last bite and had to restrain ourselves from licking our fingers
overpriced for what you get you could conceivably spend 40 and leave hungry
i have never seen a waitress so blatantly act so rude even if we did make a mistake in seating ourselves
great job on expanding your toy box  secondly errtime im back in valley of the sun i hafta hit amsterdams for a refreshing martini im not overwhelmed by the choices i just close my eyes and pin the olive to a glass
i was greeted by the smells of driedcured meats which i find super amazing
the energy is definitely very hip young and alive
make sure to get a flatbread dish
you feel like a vip and youre within striking distance of the kierland cougars
well i believe that is what it distinguishes itself from regular keg restaurants
i ordered the blackened chicken nachos and they were the biggest nachos i have ever seen for 550
i had the chicken and original waffle and it was perfection
maybe just go have a drink
i got my eggs benny with peameal bacon which is apparently some sort of fad in toronto right now it was basically ham with some sort of crispy batter flakes
im not big into the performing arts but the acrobats on stage were pretty impressive
you know how it is ladiestypically at a dive bar you dont want to have to go to the bathroom unless you absolutely have to
this is not much difference from what i had in korea
the waiter had it taken off after we complained but did add the cook was new otherwise hed dispute that
this is seriously one of the best burgers i have ever eaten  yum
whats even better is the price
gentlemen  this means nice buttondowns and nice shoes
great atmosphere with friendly and knowledgable staff
the lounge has a very intimate feel that gets very romantic as the sun goes down
while i like the d i still think it has one of the worst parking garages in downtown las vegas
i cant even describe lol you definitely need to order it if you eat here
sundays will find brunch served with some live music
best part of service is they are very good at recommending beer
i love hotter wings and these were in that ballpark
the only other dining views i have enjoyed more were from anthonys pier 4 in boston and the 360 at the cn tower in toronto
the cream cheese was ok and had an unusual texture
weve been to san tan brewery probably 30 times since it opened
if its any indication to the vibe the rest of their workers are
for dessert be sure to try the bread pudding which is probably the best ive ever had
sub par deli meats and cheese slices not even cubed
beautiful music under the lights on the patio set the mood for the evening
i had the perfect opportunity to go the other day for my friends birthday
the environment is dark and typical of a bar with dozens of big flat screen tvs
then my dish was the last to come out chicken and waffles
the place was packed so maybe its just not the restaurant for me
we like to dress nice when we go there but we see people dressed very casual as well
wouldnt recommend getting drinks from the back
you really have to try it out if you are looking for a low carb zesty savory seafood combo fish octopus clams squid
like other reviewers i find many of the waitresses rude or ill informed but the bartenders are awesome and the owner seems like really great guy
i paid for the meal at full price
service is very quick and nice
dont go here to play the tables thats just crazy
our server recommended beaus lugtread for a light and traditional beer and it tasted exactly like that
service was pretty good but there is only one bartender so hard for her to keep up by herself
bring a high end brazilian steakhouse to the gta as an alternative to the long standing torontoniagara options
the service was impeccable and the onion bread is to die for it come to the table steaming hot
i will say that i wish i had gone hotter on the curry but its always hard to decide what spicy level to do on your first time at a new place
i went here with a group of friends to celebrate a friends birthday
one of the least expensive meals and one of the better tasting ones
i am not a pancake person but would go back just to eat these again most likely as a post burger dessert
here it is much better
worth checking it out
squid robata  nice and tender with a glaze of sweetened teriyaki sauce the place is busy but the servers are fast and the food does come out really fast
didnt find the food to be that spectacular to be honest
the chef demonstrated the same talent in execution
food and drinks were of the most excellent quality
my party consisted of 1 local 1 immigrant and 3 tourists but all were wellpleased by the atmosphere service and fooddrink
annnnnnddddd  the best selection of belgian beer i have found in cleveland
the waiter brought out our lettuce cups and the short ribs biscuits
looks like its closed after only 4 months
now to be fair on previous trips to lotus i have had to amazing dishes they were specials of the day but i think it is fair to mention at least one the sea bass was amazing i really wish they would put this one the menu perfectly cooked great texture and flavors
its always packed
the dj was fantastic
from there the memories really faded due to alcohol ingestion lol
we had a party of 8 and had to wait almost a hour
conversation would be the entertainment
everything we tried was very good portions were generous
my server brought me the drinks regular and specials menu and after vacillating a little bit between wanting two specific types of sashimi where i would get 16 pieces for 28 having the chefs choice of sashimi where i would get 14 pieces of varied cuts for 36 whether id wanted a small hot sake for 7 or hot tea for 5 and whether or not i would get miso soup at all for 10 begging the question of if the luxor site calls this place a  restaurant what are their  restaurant prices like
main entrees skirt steak 7 oz
it was like an snl skitthey set up a table for us near the window as requested
the ambiance is old and kinda dark but not in a creepy way it had a coziness to it
cool food and warm drinks
we like looking at everything around westgate but this restaurant is more like a bar setting even though their food menu is huge
life is hard
a couple ales a couple ipas a little of everything for every different taste
i guess it depends whats more important  beer or food
this place crickets
will definitely come back when in town
be sure to ask to be seated in her section
overall it was just okay
overall i would never recommend this place to anyone for food
i love this place
my lovely wife said that her gourmet salad was delicious
love to eat filipino food
if youre an adult steer clear
ill stick to my regular location at town square
the drunken date cakes is a must have
this place is like stepping into my childhood and i love it
i would love to go back and try some of their other menu items
it was a mix between jazz and modern at one point the song big in japan was playing while later on sweet caroline was playing service was stellar
this kind of behavior is unforgivable and again extremely disgusting
it was a pretty good value for a very good meal
the address threw us all off a bit
way to go guys
best breakfast in lv
i had a really good experience here
overall i would recommend state street brats for a convenient place to meet up and grab a beer or catch a badgers game
1st off ive been to the rusty onion a number of times as its close to my office
i like coming here for the 2 for 1 cakes i sundays and i recommend the mocha with it
im was actually quite hoarse the next day
everything was decent but not lifechanging
this place is awesome they have the best decor
both were fantastic
once you get pass the prices this place is actually pretty good
fiamma was by far the best food and service
the springs cafe is all about healthy eating and natural foods so i should have ordered something of that standard
while it is a little more upscale for a mexican place there were some well price dishes
with a gungho social media person manning the helms with replies to tweets within seconds i couldnt help but not put them on my radar of totry restaurants  they only show up on my feed a dozen times a day
both dishes were quite filling
a close hotel recommended yardhouse to us omg so good we had lunch and dinner here during our 48 hours in vegas
moon is located at the top of one of the palms towers so the views are spectacular from the balcony to the restroom
the seasoned steak fries add substance to this meal
filet mignonette sauted mushrooms and creamed spinach
it is pretty laid back and loungy so nothing like the crazy club scene some of old town scottsdale has going on
my burger had mac n cheese spilled everywhere and it felt like eating a decent burger with a side of mac and cheese
it was saturday and the weather was soso it was pretty overcast and looked like it may rain
tao was honestly what id expect from the average club scene
the reception was friendly
parking is pretty atrocious on a regular saturday night let alone when an event is being held
the bartender was friendly but was not happy she had to be
their monthly burger specials are definitely worth checking out and always live up to the high expectations set by their descriptions
we were there for lunch on a saturday
my gluteneating boyfriend had a grinder with the spicy pork meatballs pork bolognese sauce and smoked gouda cheese
overall it was a hearty lunch
free champagne and vodka for ladies until midnight
gorgeous nightclub with fun music and people
front desk didnt receive my online reservation somehow but we were still seated right away
we dined alfresco as it seemed most of the other patrons chose as well
its best to head here wednesday for half price games or get the eat  play deal while dining
weve been here on several occasions for both fun and birthday parties
you can only eat duck fat fries with gravy so often
so either is nice
if hes in charge of the music that night even better  prepare yourself for an evening of great tunes
lets be honestthats stupidly expensive for such a standard drink order
i was missing the lightheartedness and the comedy that i have enjoyed with other cds shows
meanwhile the waiter brought me the wrong beer
i have come here for quite some time
get the summer pairing of a filet and salmon with the chile lime prawnsbest salmon ive ever had
i just wanted good food and atmosphere at a decent price price
looking forward to a future visit
great idea but rarely is it done to the point where i am blown away
so why would i be threatened with physical violence from the bartender
its as though youre getting leftover scraps of meat
and omg im crazy about the trout
the interior did not wow me at all
i have only come to this locatiopn about a 100 times or so and i cant say that there is anything to complain about
theyre still very new so its normal they have some little improvements to make but we did have a good experience and would to back again
i was impressed by the range of beers and the williams drygate glasgow style artwork in the photos and fancied a look at the old building
i was silly
i really enjoyed this place
they handled it well but something like that should have never happened
step 1 pick your burger
crappy equipment under trained staff long wait times and managers who dont see any of thisbad business
that wasnt okay
just gorgeously fused french and korean
i think 5 for an ear of corn no matter how much you dress it up is ridiculous
we were not being disruptive arrogant or obnoxious
only one other person came to the area i was sitting and said alright they have the ufc on to his wife so no one was there to be put off the fight was on
great place to go if youre a fan of any chicago sports teams
if this was available here i wouldnt have left and spent my money in another restaurant
yeah wed actually drive that far so we wouldnt have to experience do it yourself hookah again and the immaculate service at each place respectively is a huge bonus
c k and i stopped in for the happy hour specials
burger bar is hands down the best burger ive ever had
ever been to a buffet
i also hate the new york and la club scenes
i have been coming here for ten years and it has never been a disappointment
food was tasty as well
we were promised a free ride there and back to the strip
pho broth was good
also if you are not a big fan of seaweed i believe they give you the option of using ricesoy paper instead
how can anyone in good conscience serve that
i have been coming here since the place first opened to eat maryland  blue crab
would love to come back to try a variety of their dishes with a larger party
server brings food
i was in this town visiting from san diegoca and saw this little place to eat
on that note this show has a rating of 1010 for its actionpacked choreography visual effects and triple story synergy
as i walk in this security dude goes hey
my friend luvs ur beer and she wanted to get one last drink
i swear this may be best kept secret  reuben fried chicken sandwich and burger better than ive had anywhere
being easy on the eyes and a ready smile dont hurt though the first one is not as important as the second the setting small and intimate or grand and imposing needs to be well done appropriate complementary to the food and mood
ableger von joes stone crab aus miami
the place is beautiful but they sat us in the back behind one of the huge seats so our view sucked
really good vibe great selection of beers and liquor
now this is a country bar that is a lot of fun
locals meeting 4 coffee
the food is pretty mediocre
evidently our decision to remain seated was mistaken as feeling patient
came here before a movie at the queensway cinema
this place is so perfect for a date
the staff and barkeeps are always on their game
oh my god
there was no prices listed next to their drinks so i figured the martini would be in the 710 range
the rooms are absolutely beautiful with their great big deep tub and roomy shower
my wife and 2 young daughters went here on friday evening
since the mrs and i love watching diners driveins and dives we wanted to check guy fieris out
if you feel comfortable ask staff for help
had brunch and enjoyed every part of it
it could have used a little spice or bacon to jazz it up
the mascarpone cheesecake is delicious
we definitely will not be back
the food is actually pretty good too
they have 2 for 1 drinks and that is a recipe for a stellar night
good beer for sure
this place is retarded
ive come here a few times and always order their wings
final verdict i will definitely be coming back here
after going to lux for about six months i think what keeps the regulars coming back is the environment  their atmosphere is topnotch and the workers are helpful
my dinner was so bland and i was so disappointed
the show would lead you to believe that you were in for a treat  not so fast
barely any mayo on it
food was good  we liked the potatoes and chorizo plate the shrimp with sausage and the chicken vera cruz
they arent just nobodys
most recently we went for dinner on valentines day 2012 we were promptly seated then water and bread with evoo were served moments after we arrived
why do they not have this on tap
i was really happy to see that  its the same old neighborhood place  and still so cool
im not sure that you cant actually even call the dish they brought me huevos rancheros
great experience in this place
great pool for couples
it was a very quick visit but like all fox restaurants you get good service and a great atmosphere
5 big gold stars
west wing bar is where you go when you not quite in the mood for a club but you do want something special on the strip
everything i said in my 2011 review still stands but as ive aged my visits have turned toward visiting for brunch and packer games as opposed to ridiculously late sunday nights for singing and free champagne
i love all their appetizers it is so delicious such as the pretzlespopcorntrio dip  chipsand many morei am also a big fan of their sandwichestheir bltt is delicious and so is the grilled chicken avacadoi love this place
hands down the best burger ive ever eaten
found myself in the area and decided to stop in for dinner  older location plenty of parking
the coffee or the service has ever been great but today was just not good at all
ive always loved their ipas the hop school varieties rock but am becoming more and more impressed by their sours and stouts
the menu options were incredible i found great variety in the side table as well as the meat that was being served to us but the workers
dont you agree that uni is like butter from the ocean
not sure if she has been there so long she doesnt care or maybe she is related to the owners
the drinks are great and the specials are awesome
this is my home away from home
the hibiscus tea was brewed fresh and quickly
you come here for the atmosphere and  the freezing margaritas
i ordered from the sunset menu which is a prix fix menu that is available before 630pm
its my understanding that this restaurant is brand new and im aware of the growing pains that come with opening a new restaurant but this one has many
we both ordered poboy sandwiches  i had the catfish and my friend had the fried shrimp
the clubs on the wynn properties are always the best
the price is too high for the quality
its a good place go grab a quick bite before you start partying at marquee
the decor was amazing
its a small plates style restaurant which i loved
well i had them and they are not good
horrible customer service after finding a bug crawl up from the bottom of my salad bowl ew
this one is loaded with all your favorite sea creatures and fresh clams as well
this broadway show is really amazing and unique in that the actors not only act and sing but have to play their instruments live
you could easily spend all your money in there
visit 1i was served about 2 of white wine in a glass with an apology that it was the last of what they had  that they were giving it to me
there was some confusion behind the bar with the two bartenders vying over space despite there being plenty of room
just some kind of acknowledgement that we are two humans sitting at your bar
the barstools are laughable
afterwards we strolled along the street towards louis square which had really interesting architecture all around great evening
i love this place
took 30 minutes to get anyone to take our drink order
my wife also found a nice new dish  hoisin chicken
the dance floor is a bit cramped
our appetizers came and although they were the exact same as the ones wed ordered on friday they werent of the same caliber
i think they may use a certain kind of sauce or marinade for the burger patties
the pool tables cues and balls are in good shape and arent badly damage
i would think on trivia nights they would make sure they had the proper staff
great meal at a good price with attentive  friendly service
but that burger aside this place was ok lots of great signature burgers to chose from with various unique toppings and condiments
i meant this guy was awesome
great beer selection that is always changing
true to the queen st tradition of dont fix it if it aint broke java has always been true to its core values cheap good eats drinks and always there for me
the waitress was super nice and at tentative
when we went up to the bar they wouldnt give us the time of day
shrimp n noodles shouldnt be covered in runny gravy
also the music is low if it is not busy so it is good place to chatting and dating once it gets crowded they raise up the volume of music which obviously is an indian  music
came here with my family for a meal
ill be honestmain reason was the cake
what take it from a 45 to a 3 is the disgusting men in nasty thongs and the women with pasties
everything was excellent
then we ordered two buckets of coors light
fr ein brauhaus ist es relativ modern und trotz holzinventar hell eingerichtet
look wise its a beast at a whopping  foot long possibly bigger and more than enough for two people
if you dont like noise id probably go for lunch instead of during nighttime
i was amazed by the taste of the wings
need more than 5 stars
when we brought the leak to the hostesss attention she responded with well weve had problems with that in the past
all the locations are pretty consistent in taste and service but the fitchburg one was my favorite because of the ample parking lot and the roomy upstairs
in summary this place is worth a visit
from the barrier on the right side just where the stage ended it was terrible
this is my first review on yelp because i have never felt the need to post
2 pbr pool table good tunes and awesome bartenders
great mouth feel with the shrimp coating and crispy cuke pieces
wow honestly it was the best night
i didnt even get to see the canadian bacon floating in a bottle of vodka
the main room has two bath tubs in the center with gorgeous and lushes dancer in there and high up on a ledge you have more beautiful gogo dancers
ummmnnn no thank you
he has been a contestant on iron chef america and really turns out a great product
the fish was the perfect temperature and it all just melded together brilliantly
probably one of my top 5 dining experiences in the city
f bombing another bartender james
most spots only offer 12 oysters for happy hour but just like lionel richie these guys are doing it all night long one of many reasons to be a repeat customer
of course the salsa bar is a key feature of this place
gorgeous place and wonderful service
my wifes a veal lover and shes never been dissappointed there francaise parm or special
from walking in the door to leaving  everything was great
i have been here on numerous occasions over the past several years and each experience leaves me questioning the one before
last night went with the bone in strip rare and it was cooked perfectly which is obviously key with steak sometimes rare steaks come out with a cold center this one wasnt its was red but room temp which is exactly the way i like it paired with some very fresh hericots verts green beans and some delicious fresh parm gnocchi
came to joes again last night for my husbands birthday and it did not disappoint
the girls are hot and can dance really well
so we went back down and figured out that we have to go up an escalator then take a bridge across 3rd street then go up an old rickety growly scary elevator to our floor
i really like this casino
i also ordered a side of rice
this one obviously suffers from apathetic management
auch die angebotenen pizzen sahen sehr gut aus und waren bei den gsten usserst beliebt
their tartars are a personal favourite
the burros are huge
if youre looking for something more thisll probably just be a place to sleep
the service was spot on
im a big fan what can i say
if my favorite band is playing here i always make sure to get front and center because literally youre standing in front of them
a great assortment of beers tasty burgers hot pretzels innovative pizzas and plenty of sandwiches  pup food options
about 10am we head out for breakfast but the limo driver from last night just happens to be pulling up to the curb and recognizes us
but i didnt think the show was that great
the chicken was indeed slightly dry but after combining the ginger and the two sauces chili sauce and sweet soy sauce with the chicken i didnt mind it that much
theyre more innocently doing the hipster thing since its somewhat new here
i highly recommend contacting him when in las vegas
wish i could say it was better
the douche bags got super mad about it even asked for a manager he got involved oh what a surprise same answer they said your bartenders a dick uh no hes doing his job you rocket scientist  i made sure the manager knew he wasnt being a dick but this wasnt his first rodeo he knew but was appreciative i told him
i couldnt really taste the pesto
you dont have to be a guy to appreciate hot wings and boobies
the burger menu is a little odd so you may have to build your own
ill give this review 2 stars for one reason the hostessgreeter who came to our table to chat us up right after we were seated
we ordered a couple appetizers to eat and the food came out quickly and was very tasty
my halibut was very good
an amazing selection of beers great service and a cozy inviting atmosphere
no funny business here
the filet was cooked perfectly
beer is reasonable but their wine prices are way to high
patrons are not a priority before 5pm as the lounge focuses on special events and evening clientele
when the waitress presented my order i was really turned off by the presentation and how cheap it looked httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosuseridf5unxwrafcxuakbzrdwselectm0tr4ibrsujfqgewuvgaa  as you can see from the picture it was really sad and not as described in the menu
i have been to carmellas more times than i would like to admit
when i got there the cashier said the bogo applies to the onion rings
we ordered mushrooms to compliment the steak which were delicious and tender
i have a life too and i want to talk to my friends for many minutes as well
im a regular usually here at least twice a month
however i quickly remembered about the salmon i had ordered
you can get half price wings on tuesdays and the rib and wing combo for 1999 on fridays
the slices are reheated but the oven made it taste like it was fresh and hot right out of the oven for the first time
it was really annoying that for a 5pm on saturday they failed to be working hard
free wifi is available
this is something i do believe theyll work out after a while
we were originally planning to get a cabana but at 3000 a pop in addition to our tendency to sleep in we decided table service at the nightclubs made more sense
good atmosphere and vibes but the food always seems over priced to me
this is definitely in my top ten places to eat and drink in edinburgh
i will never come back again even on a night without calvin harris because all they want is a profit and not a good time for their paying customers
i think that being on the dance floor wouldve been to crowded and uncomfortable
i found the constant interruption with the waiter grilling the meat was so annoying
my fave nightclub
my wife and i ordered the burnt ends however they came with sauce poured all over them ruining the flavor of the meat
that patio is just awesome to hang out with a group of friends
but it was my birthday and i was tipsy so it was alright
i had the fried chicken thigh burger with fries
the pizza sauce didnt really have a flavor it was very  bland
my date got the pulled pork sandwich also excellent
the truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an alfredo
tables next to me came after me and ordered after me
which tasted just like a normal cocktail sauce
i hope no one else had or finds glass in their food
food was wonderful burgers   the chicken sandwich and wings were great
reviews are mostly by their own people
came here for a quick bite before clubbing service was almost nonexistent
i dont recommend this club 10 to get in when the music is not good and its just raunchy
call ceviche agua chile pulpo omg
so a grilled cheese cost 12
before we even got a chance to have a drink two girls came by and dragged us into the private room where one of them informed me that it would be 200 for a ten minute lap dance for both of us
they have floor to ceiling windows that overlook the pool
thats a 300 markup
overall   this place is awesome
it ended up being waaaaay too much food
we also tried the pork belly mac  cheese which was so good
was in the scottsdale az area and heard people raving about this place figured i had to stop by and check it out for myself
they did a great job cleaning the oysters and they tasted extremely fresh
recommendation the raspberry pork tenderloin  the hatch catch
she is an incredible bartender
that hasnt been my experience
and then they pour something on them and light them on fire
we will definitely return the next time were in the area
my friends and i met up on saturday
we both had regular coffee served piping hot in giant mugs
they have awesome weekly specials and events for games
i usually can find something positive about most places as far as pranksters too if they would go back to being the dive bar they were good at and lower the prices to what a good dive bar should be charging i would be back
i ate in the bar lounge area
their perogies are really good
i like drinking peach ciroc straight so i know want to drink his water down and i had a couple of them and didnt even feel it
it was really good
i had no idea what to expect when i agreed to come
definitely my favorite starter
our waitress was very friendly and helpful even though you could tell she was a little overwhelmed by the crowd
upon arrival there was one other table of 2 customers and after we left there were zero customers
chain restaurants have a better layout
the girls here are plenty  so there surely will be some that get your attention
i found myself constantly needing a refill and no one available to help
try it and see for yourself
they do not allow sake bombswhat
my daughter is 11 years old and is well behaved
the server also refilled out cups regularly
the bathroom has a tub which i appreciated however no shampoo is provided and i had to go down the following morning to request some
i have used them for three years every time i go out to vegas
lots of them  especially outside
i love the decor of the restaurant very hip and sleek music selection is great and not too loud like some places
he should be lending a hand to his overwhelmed employees
your meal will cost you
my friends that had previously eaten at spice route were confused
i cant recall the last time a waiter upsold me by something like 50 and made me happy about it
get in here
lots of comments about tourists
anyway you guys really need to step it up over there
we stopped in for a quick lunch  they had a great selection of salads  good portion sizes
every time we get to arizona from california every few months this place is our first meal before after a trip to cabelas
no sorry no nada and then 30 more minutes for a fing key
i had the chicken  waffles which were just perfect
cloudy green and with an oily film on top it is just unacceptable
he also gave them vouchers for next time
this spot has the best food and ambiance
went for brunch last saturday afternoon what a let down
i didnt even know about that nv law
the painkiller is probably my favorite cocktail ever
awesome music played such as oldies brought back like 50 cents in da club lol i would definitely come again
i always order their bulalo soap
one of our top worst experiences
its also perfect to dip your pizza crust in afterwards
i was pretty let down because you can make so many more meal options based on rice or rice noodles that dont have gluten in them
the place looks cool and relaxed
thank you to everyone  matt dave nick sean taylor and the manager on duty the afternoon and evening of 12112 sorry  we didnt get your name
i am taking one star off for the wait 2 hours in line and about an hour for food but i think it was longer because there was a larger take out order of 8 items and a party of 6 as well
stick with the drinks
im not the biggest beer drinker so maybe i just dont get it
there are tons of shaded spots compared to other day clubs and even if you dont have a table there are still plenty of places to sit around
weve been saying this for 2 years
some of the bar tenders can be a little snobby but overall its worth your time and money
i came in here for a night of stand up and was impressed at everything from the lighting sound and video on stage they had a large screen up there for sketch clips
be sure when you visit to try the burger of the month
2 clean and pleasant atmosphere
ive been to the lady silvia three times now
i started gambling when i sat down the first inning of a baseball game
we didnt get checked on at any point during the middle of our meal and i could have used some extra mayo
they serve butter that is some the best you can get
get there early on the weekends or you will get stuck with a wait
our entrees which were both cold sandwiches and seemed to take quite a while which seemed odd
late night fun times had by all
everyone at the still was cool
great place if you like dance music and arcade games there is a dance floor but not many people on it fair prices
service was welcoming and lowkey
this is the best coffee ive had in charlotte
sg gets extra points for the fact that you can reserve out a little spot for a small party all to yourselves
i was here for a jazz show to see pianist alex bugnon
great big place that has well appointed interior
but hey fine by me im here for the wings and not to be asked on the dance floor
this is a true dive bar minus the obnoxious stench of cigarettes
the decor and lighting is jarring
this place is awesome
he disappeared and we found him back at the front
there are definitely much better places to eat especially in this part of toronto so i would pass on this location
fortunately it was all a happy blur
the staff and food at chayos were simply amazing
even the hostess was very stressed when we got there
the real fun of course is deciding which of the masterpiece grilled cheese sandwiches you will choose for your dining experience at melt
based on the 2nd experience i went there for dinner one evening with a friend of mine
was talking about the pasta salad for a week afteryou have to try it
on top of everything else that managed to disappoint they are yet another new business in ballantyne that is ridiculously overpriced
from sitting down to paying our check we were probably only in there for about 45 minutes
ordered the pot pie steak with a side of mashed potatoes
yall dont get it
the music is good enough to dance too
everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meals
its yelp hype  we bought two yards and shared between 4 guys
very german atmosphere
eine sehr gut besuchter geheimtipp
the beets were mild in flavor and just worked with the other ingredients especially the goat cheese fondue
they might want to look into some insulation here
inside isnt bad pretty open with perhaps a dozen flatscreens and they are lcdplasma not projection which is nice as well as six pool tables and darts
most of the dishes were priced 1724 dollars if i could remember
i had to usher the hubs out and i know he didnt leave a tip
i went on a tuesday night once and waited for an hour after they told me the wait would be about 3545 minutes
this place is perfect and so close to my casa
nur geringfgig unterscheiden
having moved from texas we were looking for some authentic mexican food and we definitely found it here
i had the haddock with a wonderfully spunky tartar sauce and their awesome freshly made kettle chips
both entrees were heavy on the salt with the cavatelli being so much that i could barely finish it
the best dinning nightlife pool party rooms
yep their own tonic
their beans a hallmark of good mexican food are smokey flavored
it is nonsmelly
if you want to check out a little punk rock bar off the beaten path then i recommend stopping in for some beers  checking out some bands if anyone is playing
vegas atmosphere at its finest
all entrees are served with excellent rice and homemade refried beans
to anyone who has a taste of style this place is pathetic
i didnt respond back but i had since eaten here again
decoration style is modern and classy
food is greasy and expensive service is quite inattentive
this street has street performers and urban outdoorsman that are holding signs that are trying to be different   it is also the home of the the golden nugget which is decent    i also enjoy the old time neon lights it feels more like old vegas than the strip the things i dont like is that people are constantly coming up to you and bothering you
personally id rather get the last bus home
happy hour 37 mf thank you blue 32
they had promoters on the street trying to get people to sign up for the guestlist to get free entry so i did that for my party
i also wanted to get the oxtail fries but i think i wouldve exploded or something i pretty much breathed the truffle fries in cause it was so good lol i ordered the black  greens burger with wagyu beef grass fed beef and it was definitely a noticeably good quality beef
hectors is really the only place weve consistently enjoyed for sunday brunch
when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie the pizzas son delicioso
everything was very tasty and fresh  no watered down salsa rubbery steak or tap water
i will definitely try again and if i feel its consistent always great food and great service i will then rate it a 5 so for the 4 star ratingwe went on a friday night
the sauce was the bomb
i got the spinach artichoke dip
i had the turkey meatballs and pesto both delicious
d how do you do you
we flagged over our server and he looked at me like i didnt order anything
tonight i tried the vegan style singapore noodles and added tofu an extra 2
for the price and location and amazing food
the people were like robots behind the desk and lacked personality
their menu includes appetizers flatbread sandwiches soups and salads burgers entrees and a small dessert selection
stopped by here a couple months ago and didnt see my review
sidebar is the type of place that seems like it should be cooler than it is
nothing to go crazy over
i had plenty of water which seemed to be the key to my entire trip in phoenix
but their menu rotates every week or so so who knows what will be there next time  though i would happily trust their chef with whatever he presented to me
over all the service atmosphere food and hookah are 5 star
i havent been forced to eat at this location yet and am hoping to avoid it with all that i can but i have drank here a few times
we also ordered the pear arugula pancetta flatbread to share which was actually pretty good
surprisingly the sound on the dance floor itself is not as loud as the second level
i have to be in a special mood for their food since its focused on their sandwiches
ill consider coming back just that i think for how much youre paying its not really worth it
i prefer filtered but they were still great
i will say that the cook was busy as well
its not a place to go for dinner
the combo fajita and chicken tender platter was actually good
the art hung on the walls even resembles the old paintings you would put in your basement for display and make a cool hangout spot with your buds
ok  what kind of fish is used for the fish tacos  oh we are out of fish but if we had it tilapia
the special house ground burgers are good and the beer is cold
the macaroni and cheese was standard it was similar if not exactly the same as the district location
they have a brownie score dessert  simply amazing if you like chocolate
music and live dj with pool table and darts
my friends raved about the mimosas as well
i found the securitystaff to be extremely rude
the red chowder broke up the richness and gave a nice balance
everything was hot and service excellent
i told him that wasnt even mine
so anyway my friend wanted alternatives for her food due to dietary restrictions and he was very short with her
i think im a little jaded to the prices normally charged in scottsdale but the meal here was an insanely good value
but we were curious to try some latin fusion cuisine
so what is left
she has the best combination of customer service and sassiness that many of us bar regulars love
i have grilled better steak myself
i had the sea bass which was not as favorable as i have in other restaurants of this price level
most of the cabanas were empty
food was cooked as ordered and to perfection
were glad chandler has a place like this and are looking forward to going back
i got the kale caesar salad with the butternut squash bisque
the main reason that this place is a shithole is simple it is university of michigan fans bar
pleased to help this place edge closer to 1000 great reviews
i dont think they salt their fries either
i felt the costumes need updating though
also note that the location is not where it says it is in google maps via yelp
this place is total ice palaceso it is a great place in the summer
server apologized for it and gave us a gift card to come back but it doesnt feel worth using
some of the games allow you to accrue credits to spend in the store
staff is awesome too
the steak was cooked to order and was a nice cut but a lot of fat
great selection of beer and good atmosphere
everything was really good
defiantly worth checking out
had the eggs benny w smoked salmon on fried green tomato slices and it was quite tasty
i recently lost the end of a finger in a broken chair at a restaurant
there are several guards and security personnel around the property
i had the heirloom tomato and mozzarella bruschetta ok but not fabulous
so why only 3 stars
my family  i enjoyed a wonderful lunch here
weve eaten here before and we knew the wait for the food was long but this time was so bad we walked out
the musicians also do funny versions of popular songs and throw in things like yinz instead of you
im not sure why one location has things that others dont
it needs to improve its quality and taste of food
all were very flavorful
hands down the best food experience we have ever had
i love bbq and am sorry to say the mc rib had better barbecue flavor than this brisket
this place is by far the better and more reasonablypriced menu in the strip compared to the rest of the restaurants i tried there
i saw someone nearby who had ordered a large portion of wings who got there after us and they received their wings before us
i actually walked from the hotel so i didnt have much issue though i notice the shopping center yellow tapes certain parts of the parking
from my experience at hookah lounges that is a rarity
long wait time from the time we ordered until we actually received our order
the dance floor isnt large nor is it small
went to the event held at martini and had a blast
its all about perspective
i found a yelp deal for this place and though i saw negative reviews i decided to give it a try
as we waited for our replacement drinks our main entrees came out
quaint outdoor seating and the most incredible home cooked southern style dinning
this place definitely deserves a higher rating
i lost 30 so you dont have to
ill be coming back here many of times
large servings on that as well
heres what we ordered for lunch chicken bites 5 stars
you know this was just ok in every single aspect
glad we chose this place because its probably the most laid back of all the choices
i had alligator bites gameday food as a starter then kurobuta bone in pork i think it was pork and ot was the signature dish and topped it off wi crumbled carrot cake
if you love brunch youll love toast
ive turned many friends on to this cool spot and theyve all raved about it too
its not perfectly smooth which was a little dizzying at first but you get used to it quickly and forget about it
we were asked frequently if we needed anything else regardless of the very busy dinner hour going on even both the owners stopped by our table a few times and asked how everything was
for our entrees we ordered the beef merlot and spicy shrimp
mr norris was interacting with the crowd including me the hubby was not happy and extremely lively
the outdoor area offers a great space to enjoy with live music on the weekends
the drink specials you can get all day and throughout the restaurant but the bar bites are only available from 4630 in the bar
it took an extremely long time to get our drinks and they werent even brought by our server
i had the best grilled cheese sandwich that i have ever had
it tasted great but i really wanted it to come in a copper mug instead of glass
there is a cover charge at night  i believe its 10
i dont review unless given a legit reason no need to rant
they will work that stage like acrobats and work the private dances like its rent day every day
our server was great too
it is a cheerful statue that occupies space rather well
in our case 700 so we opened a bottle of wine in anticipation of the arriving dinner
lets not forget that by eating here youre also supporting mark wahlberg who violently attacked a vietnamese man in a race related assault
on a funny note if you are there at the patio check the east side
it took over 30 minutes at the end of the night to speak with someone in charge and then they sent what i think was a bus boy
waiter was nice though
the music is always really good
i prefer dining in places that look like diners
i will definitely be going back
the prices are a little high but the quality of the food makes up for it
towards the end i was dipping my chicken into my friends curry as an attempt to soften up the chicken but it didnt work
there are long communal tables mismatched chairs exposed piping on the ceiling and barefilament light fixtures
she certainly was worthy of a bigger tip
ok i guess the drinks are a little expensive but thats for madison prices
get over it
amber is an exceptional server
the only reason i dont give it five stars was that our waiter was giving it his all but i think he was new and nervous cause he was kind of being weird and attentive when we didnt need him then ignoring when we did
the drinks taste great be forewarned they sneak up on you especially the pain killer
hip place for a younger scantily clad group to hang in the sun
on the first page of the menu they list all of the vendors for every category of food they use in preparation of menu items
i definitely recommend getting takeout or bringing a small app platter from home to eat with your wine
i stopped in for a quick beer and some food to take back to my hotel
i see no one else has review this place for 2014 so i wanted to post this for anyone looking into going now
the food in this place is simply delicious and will have you coming back for more
it was spicy going down and had a spicy after taste too it
you enter through the back which is the front because the front has no entrance
this time it had larger fries better smoked meat but a gravy that i wasnt a fan of
she made the stop worth going back again friendly fun great atmosphere
the pasta dishes were expertly seasoned and generous in portionneither of us could finish so we got to enjoy more for lunch the next day
cant complain about anything it was a great meal
the burger was cooked to order
also the tvs were easily viewable from my vantage point and the ones that i was watching were showing baseball and hockey
we went to the other set of elevators to the tower rooms and the somewhat dingy hall to find our room
yes this place is totally a great place for cozy friday nights with friends or you know to propose to your girlfriend
sweet potatoes dumplings mac n cheese but the kale salad was by far the best
and you guessed it the burger had the red onions on it
my friend and i contacted chris when we went to vegas a couple of weeks ago
soggy as can be despite receiving them as soon as they were ready didnt call ahead
i had the ontario peaches and pears as an app very simply presented in large pieces amongst some fresh leafy greens and drizzled with quinoa and a sharp wine based vinaigrette to add contrast to the sweetness of the fruit
ive been here multiple occasions for sunday brunch late dinner and just drinks and ive had a mostly positive experience overall
the beer was good
toronto needs better burgers
thanks cori
what i liked most was the atmosphere
i went from only eating half to completing the entire meal
tips fully stocked bar
i met up with a friend for lunch and it took almost an hour and half even though we ordered right away and ate quickly
i am not sure if i would come again mainly because my idea of a great dining experience is somewhere with a homely traditional atmosphere but i really enjoyed the meal i had
the food is terrific
it was a little slow and empty at first but around 3pm it got super packed
but the servers are always attentive peppy not on their phones all the time like some other places that employ younger staff
i would recommend this place
luckily less than two weeks passed before whippoorwills big reveal and the news is all good
probably the best wings you will ever have and it is good value as well
i ended up getting some hot sauce it was weird to receive franks lime red hot and dousing it on everything that i ate
i had a dish with eggs and carne asada
pasta alla vodka was to die for
what shocked me the most is that it was rated phoenixs best venue last year
also pierogi lasagna tasty but colorless and not appealing to look at
a flight of beer is very reasonably priced
we can here for their az cocktail week menu on a tuesday
die war fr 6 personen genau ausreichend
im here for the food the strong drinks and the service
im not sure what the problem was because theyre fully staffed and there doesnt seem to be a rush
for happy hour they are half price too
without decent food i definitely have no incentive to return
service was actually really quick
before i immersed myself into the unknown i had to do some yelp investigation
no one else even compares
3 stars overall because its a little cramped and when its really busy many tourists act berentitled pushing in front of you or blocking out table space or hovering around the creamersugar area for no reason
as we watched he started eating food off of the plates as he was putting them up in the window to be picked up by the waitress
my husband and i were excited about going to donovans a restaurant we had heard a lot aboutgreat word of mouth
our server allien was just the best
they were also more than willing to help save us from unwanted attention we were receiving from other patrons
they have two location one at red rock casino and one at town square
i go for the experience today they fudech my brunch  shame on themnooo ice bucket for the custumers shameshame
its very modern and clean
or any localtoronto based beers
she acknowledged by saying trippel
ive been in before and requested the pizza be cooked a little longer because in my first experience here i was met with a lukewarm slice
its good pizza and wings usually pretty quiet has a few tvs
picked up a few padron 64 the wife who is not i big cigar lover picked up a drew estate java and she thought it was pretty good
my dining companion ordered a burrito and it was nearly the size of a loaf of bread
although pricey it tastes great and is worth it
for dinner i got the corn gorditas which is normally an appetizer and definitely was not filling enough for a meal
expect to wait but the wait is worth it
if any man ever got turned onto the goblins that work here take them behind the building and put them down
we got jalebi on house which taste good as well
what a cool place
as always service was top notch
bartenders were both attentive and could tell they were really passionate about the place
cash only and the drinks are super cheap
that was not the case at all with sagos
wanted rueben with turkey instead of corned beef because i figured they just use sliced corned beef that is usually chewy
but it reminds you that youre poor with a fine cheese plate and food that you could never make for yourself
often on the weekends live bands  artists will perform
great food service was horrible for this location
i want to start off my review by saying we really like the food here
if you like chili cheese fries prepare to be amazed
do yourself a favor and save your money
i had expected just 5 hot wings
everything i had here was delicious and special
i nice casual yet upscale place right on rt
while waiting server didnt bother to ask for water
if it wasnt for the beer id never go back again
there were two forms of entertainment going on that night with a jam session happening upstairs and a solo guitar performer playing downstairs
family run restaurant plus made from scratch mexican food my kind of place
give it a chance
having said all that heres what you get actual stemmed wine and martini glasses with all the appropriate elixirs to go in them
met the new owner and she was very friendly
what a great deal
we got the dip platter to start out with
they didnt even get her anything to drink
or maybe i just drank enough beer that the entire world was glorious regardless
dont think well be ordering a hamburger anywhere else after having theirs
on the odd occasion you may wait a little if busy but that is because it is all cooked to order fresh
how do i know its from this place
word to the wise they are cash only
da kam nachtisch kaffee etc
and the food was just ok  i had a burger with fries
check out my photo
the best scallops i have ever hadand i have had scallops in many restaurants
the restaurant was not busy and there were at least three servers taking care of the dining area but we rarely saw our waitress
ill rate the cake 289 yelp stars i had two bites and though neither of us liked it that much and my friend doesnt even like chocolate someone cleaned the plate
this man loves bacon he loves fat and he loves butter so buckle on down and man up
my game was so strong that night that some dude tried to interfere with me grinding on a female
they have 52 wisconsin brews on tap some of them as cheap as 2 or 3
we couldnt choose just one pie so we got two personal sized 10 pies  the eyetalian stallion and the cheeseburger dynomite
we had fried pierogis the big dipper and the tuna sandwich
fabulous new sushi bar in desert ridge
im a year late in getting this in but better late than never
very poor language sexual context pornography reference ect
one thing that i like about this location is that most of the games are working here
i found it just looking for a place online and it was well reviewed so i gave it a try and my friends and i loved it
die gerichte waren sehr schn dekoriert und mit viel liebe zubereitet
are you effin kidding me
great food terrible service
i started off with their horchatas
what a good time
i got a half of ribs a half of chicken dark meat greens and baked beans
they will let 18 in on a weekday but not weekend night
super clean the staff is always there to help out if you need anythingguy even brought my group party water after we were done partying
simply amazing awesome dining experience from the chips and salsa to the margaritas to the entrees
the decor was very on par with other rest in this area
also a private room is available for parties
for the mains  i had the shrimp ceviche i know what youre thinking
some of the women are beautiful in shape and dressed cutesome of them havent looked in the mirrorpretty typical of vegas strip clubs
my last nite in vegas was very well spent
no wonder the lounge was empty at 10pm on a weekend
it was my favorite of the three though all were extremely good
good food cool vibe bad service and apparently worse clientele
my husband ordered the king steak 70
overall what you get is well worth the money
doesnt manage to do either
not much has changed at harveys aph over the past year  but ill kick it up one star for still being in business
the food was amazing
you deserve it
he says theyre not
to be fair they pulled it off well
by far this is the best keg out of the chain in toronto
i had the italian stallion sandwich and it was pretty good
the only problem is that i got tickets late so we were in the back of the theatre
the pierogie saut came with five pierogies in a cream sauce tossed with with broccoli and tomatoes
katsuji made the tongue mole which was the favorite of the night
service was pretty lax food was nothing to write home about not a huge selection either
the staff couldnt have been friendlier and i have to say this is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood
this bar is something you would fine in a bigger city like ny or chicago
warning topping the a5 kobe with the foie gras andor consuming the lobster mac  cheese may result in your eyes rolling out of your head in gastronomic ecstasy
salads were so big and everything was fresh
but i must saythe dj was horrible
give me a glass of water damn it
and our service was kind funny and very attentive
you never know what youre going to get
my husband spoke to restaurant manager and he was apologetic stating kitchen was backed up
just a bad experience all around
after a day of swimming and walking around we decided that a late dinner would be in order after a very late lunch
the truffles were ok nothing like switzerland but pretty good
if youre looking for filling and arent interested in the cheese board or spending a lot of money then this place isnt for you
a nice starter
for fans of the 60s music this brings back great moments of the past with the laughs on menopause
generally speaking the service is ok  on busy days with a packed house things might get a little slow but it all depends on the day
we however wondered into aquaknox that was not in the review book
the menu is super diverse  there is thai food and pirogies and sandwiches and just salads
i also had to chase her down to get our check at the end which she brought back very quickly thankfully
i have not seen racism
in about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio
finally and most importantly the food is outstanding
we definitely wont be returning
the food was not spectacular but ok the ambiance was good
bread with awesome sun dried tomato basil butter is complimentary
we had intended eating from the bar menu but after waiting for attention and finally trying to order at the bar table service only we were told we went elsewhere
they have a great wine selection and the ambiance is upscale but comfortable with nailhead leather furniture and comfy couches
what came out was this thin flaky fish looking thing
the fish tacos are good
i got the medium sized cup which was 16
food the food was super yummy i loved the lamb curry and seasoned potatoes
pasta and burgers were just average and overpriced
the appetizer and sides bar was lacking in selection and was not refilled enough
ask for her
so when the bill came nothing was taken off
its such a turn off during happy hour
this bar has a nice selection of beers on tap and the food bar is good
i visited a second time with friends
there were more employees than patrons but at least the free drinks kept us company
luckily there wasnt any lineup and actually was a bit dead when we got there around 9pmish but by 10pm is was pretty crowded friday of a long weekend  perhaps most people were out of town
given my distaste for bbq especially when its expensive and my lack of a memorable meal here on all occasions i doubt ill be back
not too sure why the paper is even there in the first place
we had our wedding reception at the madison club this august and overall were very pleased with our experience
it was ridiculous
what a great time
the experience of coming to sandbar was decent but i dont think i would go again
i was surprised at how vast the interior of peridot is compared to its unassuming facade
eight people at 13 entry thats 104 and you couldnt but tables together
and it was one of those things that is a brownie in the skillet and it is suppose to be a little gooey on the inside as it turned out it was completely raw inside  which was rather surprising considering how long we waited for it
are you catholic
ive actually seen better looking steaks come off of an electric stove top
this is my first time ever going to arriba and it is an enjoyable experiment i will come again
we ate most of it and took 2 slices home
if i could give this place a zero i would
have had dinners here a couple of times so time to catch up on my yelping
she was very slow forgot i ordered a salad i had to remind her when she brought our food
drink specials cannot be any better
i savored every single bite of this dish
seeing as how it was taking centuries to get any kind of service we opted to get the poutain with brisket appetizer 8  hoping wed have something to much on as we wait
she asked us how everything was going mom  dad started going off
being a hospitality veteren i hardly write reviews because i feel like im always too harsh and seeing as the servers dont know i feel its unfair
plan to go there every time i get to las vegas
i didnt watch tv for 3 months after leaving this place im not kidding
annies gourmet is far from gourmet
wow what a change since the last time i reviewed
great flavor to the short ribs
reasons i dislike lax security they are aholesshocker right
wtf im not on the strip
the turkey club was very good as well
i arrived pretty much directly from the airport a bit tired but excited to begin
the food is so far from your typical mexican fare that it is actually hard to describe
really friendly staff
comedy club is passable at best shit seating and the host thought he was the main event but the local talent was ok i guess
the caesar menu is a real treat too
the salad tasted good
i ran over and told the customers to not eat that sandwich
overall pricing was fair but i could get better italian food for that same price
if your a student or just young and want to get hammered for a reasonable price this is the place to go
visited this place for the very first time with my entire family we didnt make a reservation but we were seated with no problems whatsoever
man was it good
the cheddar fondue with pretzels only is one of my favorite snacks during the colder months
of course it came with it on it
bed was okay
i would not recommend this place
the service was lacking
the room was an awesome challenge and a fun experience with friends
so if youre a nightclub person id totally hit this place up
as an added bonus several of the people in my group had horrible upset stomachs after the meal lots of imodium was required
my staple order is the veal parm along with a nice chianti
the red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness
he went away
i always enjoy the food at chilis gastonia and i think the staff are attentive and nice
however the rosemarysomething glaze had me concerned
the menu was full of lots of great sounding bites
although i thought my sandwich to be just a tad on the bland side you can change it up using hot sauce etc
great bar service and great drinks
if you order 3 tacos you get a side for free
let me say that this review revolves more around their food menu then the bar menu
wild vines is still small well decorated and boasts a nice menu but it is also louder and has a different atmosphere now
if you like meat and want to try new things  this is the place to go
he was always  available but never hovering
brunch is amazing
we had lunch here and came back for dinner it was so good
i think one more dish or dessert would have been perfect in terms of amount of food between 2 people
i had the carnitas ma pita which was pork prepared in a way that i hadnt had since i was back home
marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people
i know an opportunity for this is few and far between because of our great scottish weather
i am told during the summer the pool can get pretty wild
my friend and i looked at each other in confusion for a second and then i asked him why
they also do 5 dollar pitchers small and 5 glasses of wine till 5pm and you cant go wrong with that
i had the fillet with a crab and bearnaise sauce  really good
always a great place you can count on for great food and always consistent
seems like i had a good night
pricey but good
i work in the service industry and i can say that the staff tonight were great
the food is good the drink prices arent amazing but theyre alright
we finally talked with an usher and he moved us to another location
she loved the ambiance as i did
its nice to stop in there at any time of the day or time of year
the drinks are stiff and cheap
service is a big deal to me because if the food is just average at a place but the service is top notchi will go back everytime
yes it certainly was your fault
i went on a first date to merc bar last night and first off i have to say that the main reason i like the merc bar is shawn the cute flirty bartender from downunder
overall i am of the opinion that if a club has to beg you to come it must not be a very good cluband for good reason
great service too
service was great and food even better
the cosmic karma pizza was delish
friendly staff and service was prompt and professional
consistency is what gains a restaurant success
id definitely go back again for another special occasion
thumbs up csb
the calamari was a bit tough and chewy and probably could have used some spices but it was still tasty and there was plenty on the taco
dont quite understand the poor reviews
thats right we can use the word cause we asians   its your   typicalnot so typicalneighborhood korean barin a strip mallwith bombdiggulous grub
i like the atmosphere
the frommage course is not to be misseda delicious assortment with exquisite drizzles
pretzel fondue was ok another restaurant not too far from here is way better and you get twice as much
sometimes their new staff act like they dont want to be there but the seasoned staff members are awesome
this was the second time ive been to game on and i remembered why i didnt go back right away
the one thing that this place has going for it is that its open late on the weekends
they have a couple of pool tables darts slot games and of course you can do the famed ski group shot here to go on your fb wall you know if youre into that kind of thing
this is the most expensive starbucks ive ever been to
the food is outstanding
we wanted to sit on their patio bc we had our dog with us this flustered the hostess who had to run around for 5 mins to tell us that no one could serve us outside but we could order at the bar and take it outside so we said this was fine
sit up front and you will be messed with and pulled on stage
not the best service but the decor is interesting and the presentation was right on
fantastic music and lots of booze
they have cute little pizza shaped vibrating pagers if you have to wait for a table
if he had prefaced everything up front with we cant take certain dishes back or swap them for something else in case you dont like them that would have been fine by me
fyi  55 degrees comes from the optimum temperature to chill wine to 55 degrees fahrenheit
i imagine not many sports bars can cater to these two very different crowds but arcadia tavern does it well
but its true
service is 4 stars
feeds around 6 people
my only very minor complaint is that it gets a little smokey and you can wind up smelling a little like the food
i had the steak and it was very delicious
want a hot sandwich
it turns out that cds ac has some issues with the weather particularly when its as intense as it was during the hottest part of this past summer
maybe we still will because trivia was fun but im not touching their food
this little known game is probably the best video game ever
our entrees varied from my girlfriend who got the shrimp and grits passable to the boys who indulged on the bbq sampler huge
i am glad i slid down the waterslide but i wouldnt want to do it again because the water has way too many chemicals
next time i will just order my own
downside was the babaghanoush needed more citrus and saltseasoning
do you have a reservation
the items that were prime rib frozen custard
all store bought pastries
all the best the honest guy
the decor is very modern and subdued and the common areas surprisingly did not completely reek of cigarette smoke
holy cow pun intended amazeballs
we both had the napa valley weekend a 4 course dinner with wine pairing
delicious drinks and some of them come with a bit of a show liquid nitrogen and handchiseled ice cubes etc
shady strip mall location is the only downside
when we got there i told them i had reservation they looked at me and asked if i was the one that just called
nahm dann der kellner netterweise die definitiv nicht bestellten spaghetti wieder mit
dont let this gem of a restaurant fool you from the outside view
we went and got right in no questions asked
the staff was very accommodating
their knowledge of the products is above and beyond
l2800 pizza with just a splash of toppings
no problem with service our server was quite attentive
the best part though was our server tracee
for such a busy night i thought our server was attentive enough and that the general services bar areas bathrooms were decent
next time we will spend more time looking for stray tubes
tone was quite interrogative and we felt completed offended
it is the location of bcs local dr sketchys chapter  a life drawing antiart school where artists gather to sketch from a live clothed model every 1st tuesday of the month from 7930pm
very tentative and made the experience here even better
the food is always great
for dessert id have to say the salted caramel custard topped with fresh caramel popcorn is my absolute favorite but the chocolate peanut butter tart comes in close second
i was also disappointed by how noisy the dining area was
im not sure why but he asked about 3 times and even though i said we werent hungry yet he put the order in anyway
i have come in here a few times to watch sports events with my work colleagues i today grabbed a garden salad and split a burger
pizza was an a food was hot and servers have a great attitude and check on you periodically
caffeine  wifi  upbeat environment   adds up to something i can get into
i guess i should have asked
i came here with my family during our visit to toronto and we all agreed that this was the best meal we had there
service was bad though
the staff are very friendly and genuinely passionate about the place which is great
im not going to say it was the worst steak ive ever had
also once again because i forgot to say something our sweet potato fries came out before our meals
i laughed at her and went on my business
did not order desserts this time
never mind it was for business
25 rounding up because of the free popcorn on the bar
enjoyed a wonderful lunch at cavalis today
after doing some yelp picture stalking i ordered the oxtail chili fries and pork belly buns and requested that both be served as entrees instead of appetizers as matthew and i like to have all our food at the same time so we can have a variety of items to munch on
food is very limitedmicrowaveable oatmeal and very sad quaker oats bars
great place to have breakfast with your entourage after a long night in vegas
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosduefornilasvegasuseridezzyujdouig4pgyb3pvalj88ovtqpsqszmyygnft2w which is braised pork belly fontina and caramelized onions
wont be coming back
we had many different dishes but some that stood out were edamame youre probably thinking edamame what
in order to get to the hostess stand you have to walk down a long hall thats flanked by the open kitchen and the keg room w windows on either side
nothing on the menu looked very good to 3 out of party of 5 so we just all kinda settled on whatever we think we may like most
as piccolo is sans bar we sauntered across the street to rcc for some cocktails while we waited
a few parts of our order substitute penne for angel hair white sauce instead of red were wrong
dj jazzy jeffnuff saidpeople wanna know what hes doing these days
been to the lodge twice now with my wife and both times have been outstanding
the electro swing music really brings everything together
the food was a little above average
lack of attention to detail
super slow service
i came here around 3am wasted and wanted to gamble
we ordered fish  chips crispy just the way i like it
to me this is my back up when joeys and mercatto are booked solid i wonder why theyre booked solid and milestones has tables
i dont write a lot of reviews but i had to for this experience
despite the mixed reviews sorry for the bad pun i decided to dine hear because 1 i was staying at mandalay bay and wanted to do something close
the space is cozy and there are a few board games that you can choose to play at your table
the food has always been great and we have never had bad service
everything that is fried lately seems to be accompanied by a ranch dressing which im not very fond of
while the meat was flavorful and cooked properly the sesame seed bun was slightly hard on the outside and a little dry
i literally could have drank the broth
there were dancers on some of the tables that were absolutely gorgeous
its difficult for me to pin down exactly how i feel about now thats class  on one hand i love that cheap and delicious vegan and vegetarian food is the norm on the other hand i hate how every show ive ever been to has started and ended absurdly late there have been nights where ive seen shows in columbus and made it home earlier than ive made it home from now thats class and how the sound tends to be muddy at best likely a combination of midrange sound equipment and bad acoustics
the bartender was great and i will be back to hang out the patio with my dog and for him to try their dog beer
glad we found this spot
placed the menus on our table and ran off
my check was given to another seat and after i paid my credit card was given to the wrong seat as well
the steak was very tough
i like how they have board games because i grew up playing with board games rather than control games
dylans gaming  is a fun place to gamble when the point is not playing commercials
their wings are usually my go to choice of food here they are among my favorite wings in charlotte
defintely a young crowd of millennials are spotted at this place next door to oyshi sushi and just across the way from serenade coffee bar
we had both the banana and blueberry pancakes which were light and fluffy and the blueberries and sauce tasted fresh and sweet while the banana had a great textured outside
i expected it to be packed because of calvin harris but not in a horrible way that it was
we had seen it many times while visiting the fox cigar bar but just never stopped
kellys will always hold a special place in my heart
make the burgers better and cancel the selfindulgent self promotion
however the hostess was very polite and attentive and went to ask the kitchen if they could accomodate us and they did
congrats guys you passed day 1 of chef school
this place adds a 47 concession fee to your bill
when my change for a 20 dollar bill was 1230 i was shocked
go down the street to tilted kilt
my other girlfriend who weighs about 100 lbs soaking wet got eggplant parmigiana
ive found this type of place in ny chicago london and a few other places world wide but its never found that balance in toronto
surrender at encore is hella bigger but mostly outdoors
the seared scallops are the best in the valley and the original chopped salad and bernies mac and cheese are fan favorites
it also took a while to process the bill
i have been dying to eat at burger
stage is in the front center
kicked a black guy out for dancing with a woman
its like a margarita but with cucumber water and absolutely delicious
they have photo hunt and i can always get a seat
big open space
when i arrived to pick up my order i was given a total approximately 2 higher than was expected
i ended up getting a headache instantly
i tried the apricot wheat beer and my friend was obsessed with the apple cider with the popsicle in it
we had a california roll a philly roll and a house special  the bland street roll
there are so many assortments of meat to choose from
if you print your tickets online and are offered the pass the line option dont buy it
i think i heard the faint sound of cajones shriveling up
receptionist told us seating was very limited but yet there were a lot of empty chairs
night and happy hour was in full swing
then an employee kindly took my coat at which point i expected to get a coat check ticket and she explained to me that this would not be necessary
i lllloooovvvveeee spicy although not everyone does
great appetizers  great food great service
the salmon was cooked to order amazingly flavorful not dry and had a gorgeous crispy skin on it
we really enjoyed it
at least i think thats what it was supposed to be
excellent food and lots of it
service was fast but were more interested in regulars than a new customer
some family members came across unbearable things in the seats as well
i would definitely order this burger again sans fried egg
but that was the first time in my life that i left a meal basically untouched
reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in pittsburgh
i didnt order it p
they have a nice selection of beer to accompany your sandwich
we left a generous tip
the manager treated customers very poorly and was rude and arrogant
if i could afford it i would eat here again and try a different sandwich
point positif et de trs loin le staff est particulirement professionnel et sympathique sans tre drangeant
the decor is slick and more downtown than north york
she was very helpful and could elaborate on any questions we had on the wine of food menu but was also not pushy with making us make a decisionorder quickly
35 rancho relaxo is a goto for indie shows sometimes bringing in international mustsee bands at low cover costs
severely disappointing especially considering the other reviews
other than this place the only fusion food ive had has been kogi truck and i think both are top notch
nonetheless mission accomplished
finished off the night with a drambuie and a vodka at about 8pm but we have had a busy day
nice contemporary bar with the best waffle fries ive had in ages
i wasnt very impressed with the chimichanga or the side of rice
im not one to just spurt out my opinionbut damn you are weirdoooooppps
the menu for brunch is fantastic
i love this place and already cant wait to go back
the line to get into the club is short and easy
literally there for over an hour on 1 plate order
nowadays me and my little family only get to go out for lunchdinner every once in a blue moon
a wine bar with food
kleiner club im style einer finca habe hier selber schon gut gefeiert und auch selber die boxen zum beben gebracht in jedem fall ein geheimtipp
parking is an issue
bonus the atmosphere was very nice
youre also surrounded by hotels with outoftowners who want to get out of their rooms
five minutes later she came back and told me the salad had been taken off my check
it was still on the table when i had began leaving
my daughters order was exactly the same as mine
inside it is quite traditional with big comfy seats and sofas
store bagged lettuce carrots and red cabbage with bland italian dressing that was in the same league as wishbone
nice open space and for a bar this place has legit food
i dont know if they are the first but the are the messenger and it is much appreciated
i will have to go back someday for the regular menu but speaking as someone who just isnt that into breakfast that sunday brunch menu was definitely worth the trip from columbus
in fact the waitress said now that you mention it i dont recall seeing it either when we brought the dishes to the table
this stuff is ment to be drank as a pint sized glass
wonderfull little place
amazing garlic naan and mango lassi but deserts was ok
garlic prawns they were charred a bit butterflied open and delicious
jaime ce bar
served with their housemade fries which were cooked to a crisp perfection and tender inside
it was worth every penny
fr ein lokal das nicht wirklich als spieselokal sondern eher als bar durchgeht recht gute kche
but their rolls are unique and the staff is nice
but it had a nice layout and looked like a place i could relax
ok so this was my favorite restaurant in vegas
had to ask a few times for it before we took a jug from an empty table
back off buddy
the food is okay and the service had been above average
we had some friends staying at the venetian so they were able to get their hands on some passes so we didnt have to pay cover
i so wish there was a good salad option or a vegetarian flatbread
and obviously hodges is not the firstonly restaurant to allow their staff to show off their ink or colorful hair
my friend was talking to one girl who tried to grab our bottle and start pouring herself drinks
quant  la carte pas dinquitudes  de la poutine aux nachos en passant par les burgers et les bols vg cest encore une fois un trs bon point  noter
my family of 4 went while on vacation recently and id wanted to try it
also the menu has items with dodgy names like nasty nachoes and choke a chicken wtf
so when some friends want to go to a bar i just sit there sipping water and eating the snacks
the pulled pork was a bit dry so i generously seasoned it with magic dust which is their brand of dry rub seasoning
calamari were light and flavorful
the pasta i had was very unimpressive considering its supposed to be one of their specialties
i do not recommend at all
a group of friends and i came by late on a weekend night after a long day of being outside  so we all were ridiculously thirsty and hungry
called day of to confirm the reservation was never made
portion was more than expected and price is reasons for where it is
bland taste very poor value
and atmosphere was lively
the corn soup i started my meal with was so good i wanted the recipe
love to eat at angelias
it was the most ridiculous experience i have ever had at a club especially after paying for a table
the food is good but management service is bad
very very good  off the cuff breakfast sandwich  host chef waiter and a wealth of knowledge
this website is legit
but i will say the chicken pasta was awesome
also if your in line and you step out you have to go back to the end of the line
aux propritaires vous devriez vraiment essayer dobtenir le permis de bar lendroit a tout le potentiel pour a
i thought it was really good
he said no and if we wanted fooddrinks we had to come in and order it at the bar everytime
she proceeded to tell us that she would be back in a little bit
you can request songs best with a tip
wont be disappointed
my dining companions had the meatball the pappardelle and the pici and everyone loved their meals
i highly suggest trying this place out
the group was fun but the venue not so much
my only suggestion is for alexis to offer a variety of side dishes rather than green beans and rice every day
of course being too busy is not a bad problem if youre management
if theres an act that i really want to see and its summer and i can get there really early to secure a seat by the stage the winchester may see me again
filet mignon was only 21 the wine also had a good range of prices from cheap to expensive
as a matter of fact its 10pm and i am still full from lunch today
the dressing tasted like watered down mayonnaise minus the taste of mayonnaise
gourmet burger places are a dime a dozen these days
bartender was busy talking to wait staff and walking in circles around the bar
i am really not one to complain but i just sat there for 10 min while the server smiled at us and ignored us
the place had great little tabletents that informed of their happy hour munchies
but if youre hungry pick somewhere else
sides were good but no different than a midtier restaurant at half the price
id love to have a beer with this group in person but this is the next best option
i never need to have an overly attentive staff though
2 of us stopped in for food and a few drinks
this is the best italian food i think ive ever had and this is the premier restaurant i will take guests to
the top portion of my cheesecake the brownie kept falling off
miso ramen comfort in a bowl
5 minutes later a different unsmiling server came to take our drink order
service is great
i know everyone loves melt for good reason but even i dont want to wait 2 hours for the deliciousness
dinner here was so delicious although everything we ordered was a little too spicy for us
he was very pleased with his order rib eye was tasty and cooked to his specifications enjoyed the crispy onion straws and mashed potatoes
i definitely recommend being about 4 drinks deep before stepping into the place 7 for a corona inside
but im glad its in vegas for all us locals to enjoy
a clear line of sight into the kitchen lets you watch your order creation
all too often they discount it or seem to ignore it altogether  i can certainly say in this area dlux has got them beat hands down
i dont know if this is the case everyday but on that particular day servers were really friendly and awesome
that is not acceptable
it was the creamiest most decadent dish i have had in
at first glance on the menu i was happy to see greater than 10 vegetarian options
which slightly irritated me
you are going to overpay for your drinks
they redid the old sahara
however i remember my experience quite well
would definitely eat here again
note  we sat inside bc the pollen count was like a million but i checked out the patio and it was really cute
welcome to richmond hill tk and thank you for coming no seriously  thank you so damn much removing my jaw from the floor  eatcrest out
little nicky 2000 have you ever had an entire yard of strawberry daiquiri
try them without the bun
its got indoor and patio seating as well as an upstairs
it was a great experience for us
it was cooked exactly medium just as ordered
this is where things began to go steadily south
quality way down from previous year
that said its a hearty portion
i have always held olive garden on a higher standard than others and was extremely surprised that at the big dining table next to ours  they were doing individual performance reviews on employees
i was really excited to try this place
burger chef als special beef blend burger with hickory smoked bacon mushrooms onions and cheddar  with chips um just to be clear thats potato chips not french fries  although french fries are also available
cant even give it a star
the bread is some of the better that ive had in pittsburgh that probably means something different to everyone
dont you want to come to my table and take more drink orders
would definitely return
take a photo
a sparkling wall of glasses behind the bar that makes a grand statement
the service at this location was better then the other 2  the summerlin being the worst of the 3 due to servers being overwhelmed
the french fries were really good
the atmosphere of the coffee shop is really nice and welcoming
i usually go in after work which is around midnight when garrell is tending barbest sloe gin fizz ive had yet
teddy our waiter is the best at this restaurant
everything was amazing
gail truly was top notch bubbly sat us right awayshowed us and went over the specials tonight and make our date from the start just right
he took a date there and watched them set up
note if the word balls makes you giggle be prepared when you read the menu
day 3 rehab
sadly the doh or other municipal entity apparently kiboshed their plans of an outdoor grill
i loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant
call it breakfast call it dessert call it anything you like  it was so impressive that not only did my friend taste it she tasted it multiple times and was seen recommending it to patrons on our way out the door
nice oasis in the middle of the palazzo gaming floor
10 minutes later 2 more meals arrived
having a little more information about the different beers would be useful
i absolutely enjoyed the experience and will return
what else do you need
well definitely go back to hang out on the patio with friends and just relax rained last night unfortunately
another time i visited to see if there had been any improvement in their food unfortunately the pasta i had was a tad too oily  like i could literally see a thick layer of oil over the pasta even the pasta sauce was floating on it
they take excellent care of every customer beginning with their friendly staffers down to the licorice and warm wipes at the end of every meal
there was a huge crowd in front of the restaurant and people were being told it was about a twenty minute wait
i will not be back
hello friends now i coulda sworn ive written a review once i left here way back when
well you dunno nothing
loved this place
we tried a chardonnay a reisling a blush and a red
between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of casbahs current menu  including their scallops arugula salad duck pork and veal meatballs and a ricotta very similar to what i had ordered the last time i visited
i always get the shepard pie be ause i love it that much and my boyfriend always tries something new
our server for the evening mr mike s was helpful attentive and personable
the two prix fixe options that were offered during my second visit were 150 and 300 respectively
being from arizona its hard to compare mexican food in the midwest
and i could not believe it but the manger said well you know its a restaurant its cheap
we were craving for new mexican food particularly dicks hideaway but i remembered previewing the menu at blue adobe grill and seeing that they offered similar dishes at a more affordable price
we recommend the following if you are first timer for mojito lovers  rubejito for those who need something different bourbon sour for those just want get this drink on  corpse reviver  even though we had our fill after a round other patrons around us raved about a drink named with a naughty word that sound like sucker
had the ribeye for 2 meat was good but it was undercooked and not nearly big enough for 70 a person
they also have a decent beer list
but instead i got a super rude attitude from beginning till end
next time im in vegas i will be sure to stop at burger bar
but heels are always cuter
so you like vodka and you like bacon right
we walked from planet hollywood to hakkasan stood in line which everyone was confused on the different lines then had a security guy go through the line look at my fiancee shoes and out of line
i go to here many times for have some drink or grab a bit
the ranch and wings sauce were both really good
looking at the menu i was surprised at the cost of the meat
if dining on the cheap try them for happy hour when you can sample shrimp and roasted garlic fondue for 7 or the polenta stuffed jumbo prawns for 8
this is a great neighborhood bar
the bartender had a nasty attitude and disappeared right after pouring my wine and sat in the back talking to a waitress the rest of my visithorrible customer service skillsi was excited their was a place on my way home i could stop for a drink after work but i wont be returning
do you want the bestest bar brunch on a sunday morning
i have been many times before and had a good experience but last night was horrible
it is a little pricey but it should be expected seeing as it is located on the south side of pittsburgh
after this a manager came to visit us and apologized for all that had gone wrong he did buy our drinks and offer us their friends and family discount along with another pizza made to order to take home
love this place
the server was apologetic as were management but thats all
its a bar on a weekend thats to be expected
the food was well worth the wait
the wait to get a tablethere arent words
they also have a delicious honey beer
i felt like i needed to wash my hands when i entered midway into my visit and then again before i left
its all about savoring the way the different ingredients come together not about shoveling food into your face
knowing the and personally knowing and meeting the original caste members they would definitely be disappointed in what the show has turned into
apparently i will be on the search for a new favourite place for bangers n mash
with island sushi down the road with their own specials bachi burger needs to compete and step up their specials game
anyway we rode the incline a first for her up to the restaurant
das ist gut so  denn so bleibt uns die kochenbas noch lange erhalten  so wie sie heute ist
one of the nicest atmospheres ive eaten at
even if youre not seeing a movie the happy hour is pretty good
yes vegetable plate it has cheese wine reduction and mushrooms  just try it you will understand
owner claimed it was amazing and that i should order it and wait until it comes out so i can be amazed
overall im glad i spent halloween night at light
food and margaritas great too
this is one of those hidden gems that will put smiles on visitors faces forever
for the main course ilina recommended to try their spicy tuna steak and i loved it so much
came in on quiet night before the holidays we were the only ones ordering food
then theres the other side of the coin
i fell pretty hard and nobody really followed up with me to make sure i was okay
the salmon shish tawouk chicken kababs and grape leaves with meat are exceptional
we ordered a bunch of different items and shared
we got there early and grabbed a table
i was a bit disappointed at first because the crab was on the small side but then i remembered that this aint the cheesecake factory where just one appetizer could easily be dinner for two europeans
standard sufficient not exactly warm or anything
it was so enjoyable we were there for over an hour and a half and jose never made us feel as though he was wishing the table to be free for the next customers
jerry the bartender is also great fun
loved the speakeasy decor and the oldtimey drinks
see what i mean about a mixed bag
seriously who does that
there is no gambling licence here
excellent eatery and bar
the wife really wanted a burger so she had one also
until then good luck itsy bitsy
im basing this review off a small sample of what fiamma offers but in my opinion every bite counts
i sat at my table for at least 15 min before the server noticed me
the food is unbelievable
show was a good length and i actually liked it being at 400pm we got out just in time to do a few other things before grabbing dinner
we sat at the bar until our table was ready and if it werent for the two young girls sitting next to us we might have received better service from the young male bartender
there is plenty of room in the handicapped bathroom to put in a changing table
didnt take advantage of the bottomless fries
creamy cold and delicious
food was served quickly and hot
her husband asked them if they could whip up spaghetti with meatballs in a red sauceand they did
i had a couple bites of the macncheese and while it had a nice smoky flavor i thought it was a tad on the salty side
or waiter was very professional and made two great suggestions for us
this place has gone to hell just as every other place before it
this location is clean spacious and everyone working was friendly enough
very professional and kind servers
they have a nice outdoor patio too so it is great in the summer
p price its like average price similar to all other sushi restaurants
i know that doesnt sound like a great idea at a pubstyle place but i figured they wouldnt have them on the menu if they couldnt do them properly
this restaurant serves four veal dishes i am strongly opposed to any restaurant killing and eating 6 week old baby cows so i wont be returning here
i might have to move to liberty village
the food is really good
oxtail pho oxtail fries coconut ice cream bone marrow soup are all good
i went here with a few friends for my birthday
the bar area at least resembles the boarding area of an airport
we went here to watch the nba finals
i could probably have eaten just this and been satisfied
kaitlyn took care of me this time and the last time i came here and omg the service is awesome
if im not mistaken this is their third location
the customer service here was 1010  the food was 1010 and the decor of this place gave it a great vibe
the club is super small with vip seating outlining the entire club
i posted my bill in photos as proof
i would for sure come back here
easily the best mixed drinks that the wife and i have had in charlotte
pros corned beef  cabbage fish  chips cons slow service no other good food yet weird room layout i might come back here another time to see if i can change my mind about it but this is a place i wouldnt highly recommend
i had the shrimp pasta with lobster sauce
im trying to do the responsible thing and not drink and drive and this is what you do
the guys were talented good looking and built
they simply threw her out without any discussion
1 burger night on tuesdays
he squeezed a fresh orange and orange zest over the steak and then surrounded it with thai chile sauce
a couple times you will take 10 to 15 minute breaks so you can relax a bit and also let the paint dry so you can fill it in some more
the venue itself is good but based on reviews by other people the sushi was a disappointment
it is as good if not better than what i had  in italy
the salsa was great
i guess ppl prefer opulent and tasteless palaces
but with music food and service this good that shouldnt be a problem
the band asked for hot girls on stage
we ordered the battered shrimp coleslaw rice salad and a few beers
bad daddys did its local brand a disservice by opening this location
was a little on the pricey side considering its portion size though
as a big wino they have a great wine selection
she said the pork chop was good so i chose that and she asked me again if i wanted to order some wine
the reason young people like it is because they romanticize a past that they werent a part of
of course it came with a few traditional sides  kimchi cabbage salad shredded potato  and it was a nice all around dish
i had a tomato tampenade that didnt quite mesh as well with my other hot dog ingredients but really i only have myself to blame
bartenders make solid good drinks and the beer selection is above average
we skipped out on the table service and ponied up to the bar and bought our drinks the old fashioned way one at a time
go to the other locations instead of u must
we love to sit outside by the pool
it was the best i ever had
the diablo was too sour and i wasnt sure what kind of drink they were going for
jph offers the best pour over coffee in madison
service was good a little slow at first but she stepped up
that was ok since its christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit
overall service was horrendous
recommend the fundido
i probably would have loved it before i shifted my diet away from this kind of food
we will go back again and again and again yummy stuff
the bartenders never let your drink get empty and the food is great
the alcohol content was too much for me since im a light weight
its a small bar and if youre driving down main st you just might miss it
i have been here a few times now and this was the first time with my wife and she enjoyed it as much as i have
the mirrors on the walls and ceiling really make you want to rent a kinky hotel room and get it on
4 stars for food 4 stars for our waitress 2 stars for the kitchen
whats not to love about gold spike
aside from those pluses the eggs were not uniformly cooked there was a continuous disconnect in getting butter for a friends pancakes
the service is always bad
the pool is nice break from the overpriced pools on the strip
all in all unless youre planning on saddling up to the bar for a few drinks id stay away theres a mellow mushroom i know its a chain but much safer in this case right across the street that has a similar drink menu and significantly better food and service
i was never gaga over the food but then mostly wed go there for drinks in the sunshine out on the patio
sports sensory overload with all of the tvswhenever the nhl gets their act back together ill be watching some games from here
thoroughly enjoyed my stay and was treated very well
prizes in db are decent as 1 ticket001 for the face value of the prize which could be bought by customers if they dont have sufficient tickets
our waiterserver must have been constipated or  shaved his manliness with a dull blade since he was rude and needed a better attitude
im not one for giant heavy meals
probably on the leaf
i cant remember what it was that i had ordered
the only downside was us ladies dont get away from the everyday mom life much so when we get together its butts in seats for hours
friendly classy yet approachable all wrapped into one
six guys and three girls
we ordered the pretzel and the quesadilla and we had good left over
stopped in for lunch on sunday
the cheese was lost in translation and might as well of not been there
its not enough
eating here is what i imagined the 70s to be about
its a wolfgang puck restaurant you expect service and food to be the best
this place is large to fit many guests so it is understandable that service would take some time
one of those places where they look at you and hope theres no eye contact and then look away bad business
theyve failed each time and are in no way close to being the location in surprise which is much much better imo
all the beers were tasty the setting is fun and just seemed like a great place to be at night with live music and pinball
i attended a boxing bout here
atlantic salmon tagine is unbelievable
i cant figure out the code to make the burgers tasty
the service alone is worth five stars
anyone that goes i recommend this place and to ask for jr if you go t the bar
from the prosciutto  melon to the cheese plate to the caprese skewers to the bread plate and olives
i should have contacted management but i didnt check my credit card bill until the next month and figured it was too late
i am so glad that i ate dinner here tonight
too bad that he needed a little kick in the butt to get started but at least we were able to be to our show on time with very happy taste buds and stomachs
food was extremely good
i believe that the management at this establishment is non existent
great whiskey selection and all the beers you would expect on tap
i want to try the food but i fear similar experiences
when i want a local nonchain restaurant in the north hills this is a goto
and their cups were so dirty also
looked like karaoke coming in later we were early diners after 600 miles  not fancy
we both ordered drinks i ordered a mojito and the wife had a caiprianha
get it fixed
now to the ugly
food was whatever overpriced and not that great tasting
cole slaw was okay
way better than cheesecake factory
other than that i would recommend the place for somebody looking for a cool vibe a cheap eat and a drink
so i have been yelping for a little bit and i really really love food
would i go back
excellent service thanks to brennan hein derrik and all of the other amazing staff
ordered a cubano and when it arrives its just a pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce
fnf gnge hat das berraschungsmen einige grsse aus der kche und leckere brotsorten auch das mit herkunft erhhen die vorfreude
this is hands down my favorite resturant in pittsburgh
one piece was plenty comes with 4 pieces
and waited for a table to open up outside
my experience at sushisamba was amazing
the only problem is that the place is more for big dogs
they had a table of filipino food goodness including a whole roasted pig lechon
having a wonderful time at phoenix city grill today  picture of our server wonderful girl a lot of fun
the dance floor is always packed with linedancers  others dancing away to the country music being played
we also got the lobster crab artichoke dip which lived up to its name
not many patrons dining  on a thursday night at 7pm which can be a bad sign
we had to keep waiting on them they also are up three of our balls
we only ordered appetizers
went to this restaurant and had steak and eggs breakfast
i hope the coronado plays with their recipes because i want to love you but right now i cant think of a worst downtown restaurant
our veggie burger was downright gross
thus far i find this to be a good place to go for drinks and to share some apps
we were there around 10pm and the line was damn long
asked for 2 beers of a specific kind
4 adults could not finish
i suggest nome izakaya next door
the location is easy to find with ample parking
the pieces of paper she grabbed she placed on the table and they turned out to be the bar menu
its like the oriental trading company had a tropical luau party and the leftovers ended up mating with the rainforest cafe and this is their offspring
food is mediocre organ and room is entertaining
if youre close to the stage you will be looking up as the stage is elevated
we were treated by the servers assistant because she was on her break
from there bouncers will help guide you to the xs main entrance and the additional entrance to the indoor dance floor
good service for a busy place
i look forward to the next visit
the cheese curd is so good
so whats the big hype about this place
i was hoping to see at least 2 chicken options for those of us who dont love breaded chicken
they also eschew large coolers of beer in favor of individual bottle chillers that work well for grabandgo
i look forward to my next visit to the arrogant butcher
all four courses were amazing
i might be a bit biased since they have stambroise oatmeal stout on tap as it happens to be my favorite beer
before the waitress came to pick up the dishes i stated to the table that i thought the dish might have been raw
i would go elsewhere for fish fry unless you dont eat much  i like having a lot of delicious fish
the grillhendl was also ordered
the atmosphere is nothing like any other place in the area
i am only giving them 3 stars for the amazing food
as i was told the cook had placed it on rye
felt more like a gourmet burger joint
going into the meal i knew it would be free so i did not have the highest expectations but used yelp recommendations for what to order
nice ambiance and the food is pretty good
if you are going for a drink and a snack then expect the drinks to be weak and over priced
we chose the first level to enjoy a bevvie since gaming is available
we were greeted by larz the host whom which we believe should be promoted to manager and tells us there appetizers are gangster
they have a good selection of coffees to choose from and other drinks
the beer menu is fantastic
we started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was awesome
horrible for girls
the arancini or balls as i call them and the focaccia are the most amazing things on the menu
it just didnt taste like a midmorning drink
its a dark little place with a red glow from the christmas lights hanging all around the room
i dont even remember what i ordered it was so unimpressive
also a way to get free show tickets and other gifts is to attend a time share presentation ie
auf dem weg dorthin wurden wir von dem pseudo und oberwichtigen restaurantmanager abgefangen welcher uns dann zu unserem platz brachte
an easy place to let your mind get tiffanytwisted because theres surely plenty of time and money to be spent at kazimierz
i also ordered the tater tots which were awesome
my suggestion is to hit up the bar across from hob and get a huge freezy drink for 9 with an extra shot
the tobacco selection is second to none and if you ever have any questions or concerns they are more than happy to help you out
a 12 bottle at the store should be about 2024 in a restaurant it is 36 here
we liked it so much that we booked our annual company holiday dinner here
i picked up a bunch of togo items for us to sample and thus here is the review on our 45 ninja city feast
hopefully next time they can make the drinks less watery
i showed the man my government issued identification from puerto rico
she ended up going with the simply mint green tea
the grandstanders who state they will never come based on that probably dont know where lawrenceville is located
was it ever good
all very friendly and great service
the spaghetti  meatballs was again large but the 2 meatballs were more on the smaller to medium size and you were really left with quite a bit of pasta
hat uns sofort als nicht stammgste identifiziert und auch so behandelt
it seemed like a high end sushi place
i got an order of wings to go and while the wings themselves were quite tasty the accompanying sauces were pitiful runny lacking in flavor
i will never eat there again
there was a private party that night but they were not over the top loud
cappys cafe is one of those places that you go and hang out with your pals for a bit to eat while catching the game
the draft beer selection was really impressive also
i dont need salmonella its the holidays
the salsa bar is excellent
i am sad to report that this was not the case
all i have to say is yikes
mir ist schon bewusst dass man es dort mit den kassen und trinkgeld getrennt halten will  aber andere locations bekommen das auch anders hin
dont let them trick you into booking a table in a small room w a pop up 2ft high stage where they say snoop dogg will be performing  he performs on the main stage  you can get in there for free
if i have one thing good to say about ka its their ability to make the show look so cool on their posters
on these nights dont worry about wearing heels and cute chokers and a nicer romper like i did
loaded with restaurants and outdoor bars and kiosks that sell various items this is one place you must not sleep on if you are in vegas
the atmosphere seemed really stressful and angry there
my boss got nachos and they looked awful
it means i have taste so foff
note to hostess  if you are going to have front doors that stick open then dont seat people at that front table  or rather than stand there with nothing to do shut the freaking door yourself
the burger was cooked exactly how i had asked and the fries are killer
and to top things off when my girls and i totally started to not feel his poor excuse of a vip table anymore he goes and slaps my ass
also um you guys cost more than literally all of the cocktail bars in madison
the strawberry shortcake was huge how can you go wrong with a ssc
the server was nice but he never checked on us we both had salads to start entree and a dessert and he never refilled out drink even once never even asked if we needed anything else
overall id definitely recommend eating at this place
the tuck shop is the place to be when youre missing home
great flavour and the flacky pie was delicious
friendly but almost nonexistent
for entrees my wife got the gnocchi with chicken olives and a tomato sauce
very friendly place and open early
ive seen two comedy gods here in the last year so maybe thats why i like it
we enjoyed our time together
they came out with this really tasty horseradish ranch but the chicken was wayyyyyyy overcooked and dried out
it is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love
its somewhere between below average and painfully awful
its a private property u can leave if u don like it
other than that ragggeeeeeeee on
finally i got my stuff  i was upset and pissed off that the restaurant sucked
not only do they cheap out on the booze but they also gave us more ice than pop
no matter what you dont blame your mess up on the customerthe customer is always right
as a party of nine we tried to begin the night at the bigname big box german beer place
great food and great service
will i come back
we walked in and were seated right away
now lets backtrack a biti do not know how people start lining up at 8am
the menu is large with enough diversity to satisfy varying appetites and budgets
i dont believe that this type of bar would succeed in boston but i would always be thrilled to make a trip back to la cave du vin
placed reservation and the place looks cozy when we got in
sit anywhere the menus are on the table and eventually the server will show up
came in for happy hour
7th point of awesomeness for passion8 we asked for the bill handed over the credit card and butch came back with the adjusted bill
my friend also enjoyed her dinner but we could not move as our food coma started to take over
not only is the club incredibly large in size with massive vip tables a great sized dance floor and copious bars located throughout but the wall to wall people is overwhelming
it was amazing
i could write a page about geisha but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up
the ferrari store on the casino level may be dancing on the high end of the opulence scale but hey whatevs
the chips  dip were pretty good loved the green onion dip but the chips could have been a bit more crispy
but given its very steep menu pricing i would not suggest this restaurant if youre looking for a steak dinner without feeling robbed
the pulled pork is especially yummy and you cant go wrong with a burger
it switches around constantly but we happened to land there on a day that had second breakfast truck
they are still working on getting a full meal menu once their kitchen is fully installed but they have appetizer food like pizzas available
but man the burgers
it took the waiter 10 minutes to greet us
this is the reason you come to a traditional beer hall
which i found hard to believe considering the hotel was barren
we had the buffalo and the kobe beef burgers which were amazing but we were blown away by the decadence of the   chocolate burger
however this was not what i expected to spend for happy hour
he was very attentive to us even though he had to tend to a number of tables
it has this comfortable feel to it where you can sit there enjoy your food and visit with your friends
i asked her nicely and noticed she poured up some henn privilege
hmm everything looks pretty good
it fit the bill perfectly
if you have not checked sorso out you need to
good menu is limited but the pork dumplings were delish
let me start by saying that the wynn las vegas is an absolutey beautiful hotel
let me tell you the pear sangria was life changing
i cannot wait for the central phoenix location to open
fried chicken and the corn cheese is a must
steer clear there are so many better places to go
that is until we found three amigos
my wife and i split the 13 combo we got a cheese enchilada beef tamale and a chili rellano
i guess if youre absolutely desperate to eat youll end up here  the end of the night
just make sure to not have any worries dont worry about how youre getting back to the hotel dont worry about your problems back home just dont worry and youll have an amazing time here
not much choice for the 2 for 20 or 2 for 25 deal that my husband and we coins choose
the shrimp dinner was great
i had the crmes brle for dessert and it ok  ill certainly keep it on my list of goto places in the city
well we ended up at whiskey rose
i thought morimoto would thrive at their sushi and such but it was really mediocre
the food was really good we got a giant steak and had a lot to take home
um ya it is better than starving out here
i had a hard time actually locating the restaurant because its not very noticeable meaning they need a bigger sign
and man i enjoyed it a lot
always a wonderful crowd
been here a couple of times for occasion dinners and i have never been disappointed
the meh  my wings were soggy
i had the crme brle and it was fantastic
no to the wings
the service is awful and everything is so overpriced
lets set the scene 3 months ago my friend went had a great night and her debit card was mixed up with someone elses
conversation became a controlled shouting match while he was around
it wasnt loud enough to be obnoxious and if i sat in a different part of the restaurant the volume would have been fine
the 25 wagyu beef merchant burger was really dry and tasteless
great food except for the plantains
the staff here is awesome
i do like the summerlin location better
now you have the mother of all dilemmas
brillo will provide just that and cheap beer
we loved the overall atmosphere of prince arthur street and would visit les deux gamins again when were next in montreal
recently i went vegetarian so i had the veggie and bean and cheese taco
they have a main dance area thats decently sized as well as a side bar area that plays different music
everyone was really nice to us too
i was also there in great company so that probably helped but then it always does neh
i will gladly continue to drive to commodores 7th ave and i17 to eat quality food and excellent customer
if it were possible to give less stars i would have
the bar area had a good share of seats at the bar and a few lounge tables
the room and location is fantastic
i guess well have to try some food here during regular meal hours
this is a great funky little bar with friendly staff identified by their hawaiin shirts
dinge o rama
wow sorry to continue this negative trend but i have nothing good to say about my experience
these are strip prices even for the drinks
unlike other clubs you cant even enjoy yourself because its too crowded
you must go  it was romantic and drinks were great
service awful food was good
for me i wasnt interested in food at the time but the people i came with did order mac and cheese and wings
this was the first time in years that we have gotten pizza
one of my most recent visits to brio our waitress was a blast  we had a lot of fun kidding around with her
we asked for their water and then after a reasonable amount a time a server came out and put a plate in front of my mother
hubbys grandmother came straight from italy and trust me these meals rivaled hers
the staff are really helpful and the ambience is great very chilled
there were about 10 of us  we were pretty much the only people at bar 2 they had a djkaraoke but it was pretty terrible
i recently went to a show at the axis and had the worse time just to trying to reach the pit area
play games sit and chat study its a multipurpose facility thats just great to hang out at
right now the restaurant is packed from eating with the elderly time through closing because it is a new and different restaurant in the south hills so be prepared for a bit of a wait
we have dined here several times
something about it feels quite differentin a good way the cocktails were decent tho
that means that they served me old seafood
my mom had a caesar salad she also enjoyed it
we constantly got attended to every 1520 mins and one server informed as that a table closer to the stage was about to be free soon if wanted it
service was pretty good
their drink specials are pretty tasty and cheap
so a for staffers and b for food overall thats a pretty good average i guess
a little over a week ago i made my way to this venue as my friends band the diableros were having their cd release there
if you choose to not get the membership each time you visit ten23 you must pay additional 5 fee
came here this weekend with my friend and absolutley loved
fun alcohol options too and a great outdoor atmosphere
so glad we did
its always my goto place when out of towners come to visit because it has something for everyone
i would go back when the weather gets warmer to enjoy the patio
i cant remember if theyre still on the menu but the buffalo onion rings
im writing from my own initiative mostly as information for other actors interested in performing at one of the few madison theater companies that pays actors
i definitely recommend this spot for happy hour
the only downside is that they took the white peach sangria off the menu but other than that im satisfied every time i visit
the food consisted of tacos sliders and boneless chicken wings
without doubt a trendy restaurant though not in the way that many would think since the menu is rooted in chef howards training and travels those put off by loud restaurants will be happy to know that sparrow  wolf does indeed feature music though at low volume with bands such as the red hot chili peppers not obtruding on conversation that will likely be sparked by beverages such as jump the shark or spring mountain sour this particular nights feature entitled german slurpee and identical in texture to those at 7eleven but all grown up and mellowedout with titos vodka thyme peach and reisling
if the meal had been impressive i wouldnt complain about the price
their tap selection was awesome  they were hosting 3 fantastic out of town breweries
more like the louvre that not even the owner knows about because its fing disgusting
then an employee brought who i assume was her child into kitchen and she stayed back there playing with the staff for over 15 minutes this causes the waitress to take awhile to check on us
my family and i were looking for a new place to try after the badgers game and found granite city
took my honey here for valentines day everything was awesome
everyone so friendly and happy to be there
the fries were great and had a nice salt and pepper coating to go with the home made ketchup
the signature and perfectly peared bruschetta was very fresh and a great blending of flavors
had a really good time at this place
it was made with grass fed beef and had aged cheddar and bacon
we cancelled our drink order and left
i do not think it was the fact he would not take the 20  it was the that he could not give us 5 mins with eye contact
i have been to this venue 3 times in the past year for private events and have had a positive experience every time
the house lager is 250 and is pretty good
this place is an a for its locale but a c for the upscale cleveland market generally
good drinks at a good price in a fun atmosphere
tickets dont have to be printed out if you can pull it up on your phone with the barcode to scan and they dont search through bags or anything before entering the theater which made the process easy
we in total had 4 margs 3 on happy hour cant beat that
no one standout but just wellmixed drinks
we were the furthest from the stage but still couldnt hear everyone at our table
every time i came here it was lively never empty
not to mention that is was only luke warm and had no flavor
got there after 12 so the guest passes were void
had lunch there and my friend had the chicken sandwich and i had a cheeseburger with braised mushrooms
definitely gonna go back but still wish that food was cheaper during the happy hour to meet people more happy
she said she would order it again
unique flavor and has a good crunch even though it was smothered in sauce
i came here for a wine and canvas event and was pleasantly surprised when i approached a charming building that looks like it belongs in the dublin and not cornelius
they said theyd ask lost  found  call us back
may try another location where i heard good things about service  food
when you walk up you can still smell the stale beer that has surely soaked into the wood work at this point
overall it was a good experience but not quite as mind blowing as guy described
even if you look a mess
most comedy clubs are dirty and gross and the people who work there are mean
other items could be finished quicker because of all the people but hot house manages to refill them pretty quickly
dreaming of peanut butter on my burger and a big bowl of puddin
i saw hank iii here on sept 19 i thought that this was a great venue
our waiter took it back and instantly brought me another pork loin sans potatoes
for domestic beer we were paying around 78 a bottle and upwards of 1112 for a nice mixed drink in the grey goose lounge
the seperate foyer was a nice touch when getting ready to go out the bed was beyond comfortable and the bathroom was extremely luxurious
this place is dope
great happy hour
dinner service starts at 5p
most delicious hamburger on earth
got a groupon for 2 of the 50 oz alcoholic slushies and an order of fat fries
the baos were very good and the bulgogi fries were huge
i didnt realize rehab was at this hotel until i saw posters
i actually really liked the atmosphere but not much more than that
i get my moneys worth
thats fine but they didnt tell me this until five minutes before everyone elses food came out
portion sizes are large so im having leftover eggplant for lunch today
peanut butter paradise
i ended up disputing the extra 20 through my bank
i understand the laws but a little courtesy and understanding goes a long way
and great soups and salads
i like this place however more detail to managed hospitality be the guest   make me want to tip you a lot
im not too thrilled about it
maybe it does deserve another try
we had our 10 year old daughters party there this past summer so my son wanted his there
so alleviating that should be convenient and not time consumming
the bar is my favourite part
sorry i wish this review was better but its just honest
the location in and of itself makes it worth eating or having drinks here
15 minutes later our waitress came by to ask of we had decided on food
the worst service i think ive ever had
it isnt that but the food was good and staff was friendly
you cant really go wrong here though
the atmosphere is nice and breezy
the ravioli was served with stewed oxtail and was tasty
first time here 1010 would come again
the cream cheese frosting is creamy buttery and just sweet enough
unfortunately i was with some people that didnt want to go to the club so i just poked my head in and looked around but didnt stay
he has an amazing personality and made us feel welcomed
i am so happy that payton curry decided to bring his new concept to old town
we arrived on time and they were completely unprepared for us
the tacos i had were good but the pickled veggies were actually frozen when they brought them out
but there was a nice amount of clam meat
this place was a blast
based on a referral from a trusted source my paramour and i made our way to this delightfully dark and smoky little spot to escape the hideous madness of the strip
there was nothing fancy about the flavour until you dipped them in the port cassis jus
when they bring us our drinks we order our food
its a quaint restaurant that seats around 25 with an open kitchen and bar
they come with a salad
after the concert we called uber
the food is pretty good here but the service was ok i got the boneless chicken wings and i really liked the sauce and seasoning i got jalapeo and buffalo
partly because the restaurant was located in the convenience of our hotel the cosmo
i fell in love with this restaurant last year but then this year i reserved their private room and i was truly amazed
and then there was the food
i love lobster rolls have lived on the east coast and have traveled to boston and the new england area and i was not disappointed with theirs
i didnt dislike the food but the menu isnt exactly cohesivepizza and asian cuisine
how are these kids going to learn to act in public
plus the chicken one was overcooked
i was happy to have been able to introduce this new place to my friend
first they have a stage which is really cool because they have live bands
we went on a busy friday night with a reservation for 6 people
im not a huge gambler but like to take a crack at it here and there
my cake was displayed
im pretty sure that i could make it at home if i mixed the queso sauce from a jar with some jack daniels bbq sauce
everyone else in pittsburgh seems to love it so perhaps i went on a bad night
would i rush back here
the crowd is horrible
we got our water glasses filled and were offered the wine list
this place is off the hook
during this scuffle someone steps on my foothard
anywho i turned back around and found parking next to the restaurant
plus we have all the different steaks and they are melt in your mouth
could it really be
in response i angrily accused her of culinary stinginess but she responded with a heartfelt denial coupled again with sad eyes and i just gave up the ghost  85 dear readers for a couple of burgers and fries
i stuck with iced tea and my boyfriend for coffee
let me tell you about the sound though
we went to a dinnershow last night
the only thing i would love to see is chairs the are more comfortable
mmmmm the first and possibly best waitnoworst part of the night approx 10pm was the guy out front with a baby in a stroller smoking cigs
i eat here at least once a month typically more and have never had a bad meal or service
ya gotta be kiddin me
we wont likely be back
if you are ever looking to go somewhere to dance and listen to good music i have yet to find a better place
never had a problem here other than getting a seat right away
my sister made reservations to provenance for easter brunch
then she takes of 50
my husband loves the chicken cordon blue sandwich which is always yummy as well
my friends and i will continue to visit koyoi whenever we decide to hang out
it was super spicy and really good
i love that it wasnt too packed there was room to walk and dance
had a great time here if only i could recall more of the night   i understand the cover is high although we didnt pay i would have paid to get in
a really good friend took me here for my birthday dinner as ive been wanting to try this place for the longest time
a big sprig of super fresh basil some lime wedges some kind of fresh sprouts a few slices of some green chiles and perfectly cooked rice noodles come together with the deep rich broth and the thinly sliced beef to make a soup that was just amazing
our final dish was the 5 meat churrasco grilled hanger steak ribeye pork tenderloin chorizo lingia with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri
we even spent one night melting quarter into the bar
everything was outstanding
the music was bumpin and the dance floor was packed
all were really good and the 20 bruschetta and wine special monday  tuesday nights 8  10 was a killer deal
it was a welcome surprise
i dont know why there are two postings for the same place but im assuming lily denotes the downstairs portion of this place
then enjoyed 3 of their specialty rolls  hamachi with jalapenocilantro green sauce and garlic chips sun dried tomato vegetarian roll and a battera roll with shrimp spicy tuna and avocado
and it seemed like such a great deal
this is a nice restaurant hidden gem in a dated shopping plaza
i was actually very impressed with the marquee
we started off with the queso con puerco
with the likes of the overrated fountain and the for me yettoexperiencebutoftenlauded caley sample rooms in the near vicinity youd be forgiven for never trying mccowans
i tried several different mixed drinks and they were never quite right
food usually comes real quick
family fiendly too
we managed to get out of the place just 5 minutes before our flight started boarding and im not sure my stomach appreciated eating half a burger in 5 minutes
it is definitely a fun extremely american bar
i think this place has great potential but as it is get a beer and relax
they paid close attention to details such as refills on my amazing plantation tea everyone should try it
this was my first time here since they reopened
on the weekend nights the place turns into a musical concert venue
bacon candy  thats all you need to know
finally came to our table at 608  my mother said we would like to order from the happy hour menu
sitting at home and drinking crystal head vodka is way better
both were spectacular
well i typed up a review and my computer deleted it
okay so maybe this place isnt such a hidden gem afterall since last night when i came here it was surprisingly busy for a wednesday night
its so open and a gorgeous downtown spot
that is all i ordered because it arrived burnt and really really greasy looking not appetizing to look at or eat
havent been there but they had too much going on to toss used wine corks in a bag for me to use in a craft at an elementary school fall party
i also gotta say the drinks here besides the long islands are expensive
this place is really cute
and i shared an appetizer of the garlic shrimp
our waitress never smiled once it looked like all of the waiters were zombies with no emotion and not friendly at all
they were very efficient and friendly
been coming to this location since the 90s and was always great
the beers are as everyone knows are fantastic
eat here when visiting from out of town had sushi rolls and nigiri the service was good
we paid 70 for four girly drinks but thats expected
this is a great place to go to get good quality cocktails on queen west close to the park
prices are reasonable too for tickets food and drinks
sat upstairs in the bistro which was full of charm
despite this he did sound like toby who i have heard sing 3 times once in afghanistan and twice in iraq
food is clean and simple in style
the service and friendliness of the staff is always wonderful
amazing place with good food and amazing hot pepper sauce
if you like to socialize in a pub setting with friends this is a perfect spot
i consider a place like starlight a treasure where more and more places like it are being replaced by chain crap
the service was kind of slow
dude are you serious right now
party of 1 took 3045 mins to get a seat which was okay since i had nothing else to do but still 3045 mins
other than that everything else tasted very good
bottom line  mediocre food with a staff that thinks they are doing you a favor
i have to say i really dig this venue
again very good
ive had their soft serve and crack pie separately  to me they taste better together than separately
flappers only please
it cant be happening that the wines they are serving up have so much sharp vivid defined character   and here we are in a generic dentistofficelike building just south of the beltline
i dont want that the server jots down the order anyway and walks away
you might want to check your own menu
the food came an hour later
however it was kind of hard to eat the cupcake as we painted even with a fork  theres not a lot of table room where you paint
fortunately and unfortunately i guess there was not a whole lot of people at the show so getting a seat at the bar or up close was not that difficult
heard off camerauh huh
tried the thor tots appetizer and they were delicious
food quality is very good
as monte carlo guests we were handed some coupon for 3 drafts while we were out at the pool
salmon was good salad was good friend had meatloaf not very good
i enjoyed the food immensely though and would love to return on a weeknight when its not a zoo  partially attributable to our group but there was enough of a crowd and given the expense that i probably wont make a strenuous effort to return immediately but its a great place im glad i went and i will be back eventually
when we walked in the young lady at the door stared at me until i said it was just the two of us
i might be back for lunch but i probably wouldnt pay dinner prices again
une des meilleures adresses du village menu vari ambiance toujours au rendezvous bon service une formule gagnante
die cocktails sind hier nur zu empfehlen zumindest zum vortrinken wenns danach noch in den club geht
the guacamole was simple  refreshing
the bar was playing johnny cash
easy onoff freeway access from everywhere
im not likely to be caught dead trolling scottsdale even nonscottsdale scottsdale by my lonesome
i taught them well
we were all stuffed but somehow i talked everyone into sharing the sticky toffee cake with me
we got there an hour before closing time on a thursday
but it does have its origins in the rust belt slapittogetherandmakeitwork culture that makes pittsburgh unique
came back to give this club a second chance
the music was ehthey were playing some mellow music but it is a sunday i guess
ive always been impressed with the food and service that ive received at wolfgang pucks restaurants
great selection of beers from belgium germany etc
although our appetizers came out in good time and were pretty tasty our entrees of pasta did not come out even after we have waited an hour after ordering
sometimes i wish that they ventured into sandwiches though they dont really seem to have the kitchen space
others in our party were unhappy with the wings  too few per order hot wasnt hot  calamari was not good
my wife and i also tried some soup for the first time
our drinks were brought out timely and we told the server our full order at once so that he could pace the meal for us
the friendly staff was very happy to discuss the beer and brewing process
would have given it a 5 but our waiter was awful
the outdoor patio will be a sweet option in good weather
on dirait bien que la thmatique du moment est les les tropicales style hawa et ctait reflt dans le dcor les cocktails aux menus et surtout les concoctions spciales cre que pour ce moment de soleil
this is definitely a place where you can bring a date or even a group of friends
heh my meal was some chicken sandwich thank god it was cooked all the way through
disappointed to a new end
the stage is wide and raised so you can always see the bands and the sound techs booth is well placed so the tech can do their jobs and make the bands sound great
but had a tiny orange slice
i didnt try the dark meat but it arrived shredded which seemed weird
exciting atmosphere even a live band tonight
admittedly the variety of menu selections brought smiles to our faces
i am 64 so if i cant see over it the other 80 of the population must be too
we loved this place
i am not a huge bean fan and was hoping to be able to sub something else for them without an up charge but that was not an option
a must stop when we are back in town again
home of a surprisingly good fish fry on friday nights
had i known they were going to put it upstairs i might have requested a different table
wayyyy over priced for lunch
if we lived in this area we would come more often
the new lady grace she is ultimate
im having a beer minus the shot for 4 extra bucks and some bacon cheese fries
many of our family gatherings are cornish pasty company lunches  we buy a ton of these treasures and eat them together whether there be 10 of us or 20 of us
i appreciate the freshly made pastas
it gets pretty crowded and theres not a whole lot of room for dancing
forever to order food  forever to receive it
they sang dance made me laugh and almost cried tears of joy
this establishment by far has the best drinks you will find in the city
we wont go back cause honestly wed prefer to all eat together  hers is never right so pass
the food is very average bordering on poor compared to other mexican places
how dare you guys let woman get sexually assaulted and then arrest her
even a sign painted on the wall pretty much says it all before you go in  no douchefullery
in a nutshell food was interesting and inventive but the over the top theater felt like an audition for yet another vapid selfindulgent cable foodie network clone
i was not happy at all because of the rude expression of the chef and  it took us over 15 mins to get our check and another 15 mins to finish to pay for it
the star here is the huge backyard beer gardenyou have no idea how big it is back there when youre out front
and the hookah got burnt and we wanted to order drinks
but jesus criminy
1010 would recommend
was speechless when my order was brought to me
the drinks are so beautiful and delicious this is what a vacation is about relaxing drinking out of pineapples
die cocktails finde ich wirklich lecker und auch die snacks und das bier schmeckt gut
just a thought
lunch specials are pretty good  half pizza or sandwich and salad or soup for under 11
and its not covered in those disgusting dusty plastic vines i hate those
i had the oxtail chili cheese fries with fried egg
my first amazing fine dining experience with my new wife as we got married at caesars palace
certainly dive bar customers and decor
as long as you dont mind the smoking a couple drinks will put you well on your way for the evening whether you decide to stay or move on
to me that is bar louie i cant say the food is bad
its hard to find any kind of italian beef in the cu area and this worked for me although my favorite is still portillos
35 rounded up to 4 ive had two visits to the wren now which is still looking pretty lonely in its stretch of the danforth so its nice to have a good eating option prior to imbibing at the only
the honey hot wings order extra crispy are outstanding
amazing and the main reason for the extra star
service our server was super nice and didnt mind playing along with some very bizarre questions from our party
they even served it to me on a pretzel bun
chili beer soup and cheese curds all well above average
prices are fair and the selection is fine but i walk away feeling unsatisfied every time ive gone
one of my favorites on their menu is their truffle mac and cheese with bacon and mushrooms
who knew they could make mole using karo syrup as the main ingredient
nice starter and i liked how the filling was arranged in the lettuce to where you get the crab and spice at the end of it
i am however very happy to say this place offers the largest variety of vegetarian and vegan options available ive seen in a long time
drinks were generously made too
it took 20 minutes for us to get our bill after asking both our assigned waiter and the manager  and the waitress i spoke of earlier ended up being the one who brought it to us
the food was good and the service was average
service was nothing to rave about
a friend of a friends hooked us up so we got in for free right away
in retrospect i think the morning glory would have been a better pairing
i have never seen cristal bytheglass before
youd think he could have taken a minute out of his day to make us feel welcomed
the server we had was extremely friendly
place is right next to a strip club
we always have a fun time everytime we come here
we finally had to flag down a bus boy to bring us water
potato soup is wonderful club sandwich was good but bacon a bit too salty
an excellent guinness pour the black and blue is divine and the billy beef with sweet potato fries will make a believer out of the most hardened cynic
service was great  didnt have to wait long for anything even though it was a bustling and busy friday night
einfach fabelhaft so stell ich mir immer wieder einen gemtlichen abend mit freunden vor
i will say though that you get a luxurious amount of food for a very good price
if im ever in town again u can bet ill be here
it lacked traditional spices you find on pizza
the patio area is enclosed so it seems like a good spot regardless of the season
that was a big plus in my book
his steak was the juiciest steak ive ever had
i was one person  how long would it take for her to take my order
did not know this restaurant had anything to do with sammy hagar until we sat down and looked at the menu
we were off to a good start
we had supper this evening at the stone lion this evening
the smoke from the nitrogen fills the assembly table in front of you and the chefs get to work designing a edible beautiful flower beautifully presented on a plaster replica of jose andres actual open hand
fastforward to the end of a great evening when we receive the bill
i am now back at the office and i unwrapped my sandwich only to find an unacceptable amount of chicken
not coming back
are they phenomenally spectabulous take your breath away freakin magnificent like the balls your italian nana cooked up with her famous gravy
this place is so much fun
i took my girlfriend to brio for a nice dinner and i was impressed
they told us that there was a ufc fight that night that they were completely booked for that event but we were more than welcome to sit until the prefight started at 4pm
the service was slow and the food cool
the meal finale was the bacon wrapped corn dog
will never return
the service is amazing and the staff is really friendly
rooms look modern and neat
however if i were in cleveland often i wouldnt make a habit of going there
pricewise it isnt a budget location
we never go unless its happy hour but they usually dont disappoint
the shishto peppers wereunexpected
the red wine i ordered was a bit pricy but delicious
great appetizers  terrible customer service
in spite of it being too big to fit on the plate i still finished it
service was friendly and efficient and we went back for a second round the following night
we were there on buckashuck night so it was extra hopping
next came in my angry chicken again as the plate was lowered the entire dish was explained from the sauces to what degree the chicken is cooked at
everything was great and served fairly quickly
no one apologized
the burger tasted extremely fresh as did the avocado and onions
it was a fri late night and me and my buddy decided to try out lidos
will go back
upon arriving we were warmly greeted
overview ive been here 5 times with my friends from opening night through just 2 weeks ago and we all have yet to have a good time here
madisons is the place to be when the dj is good and the music is bumpin
our waitress was fine she did her job not great but not poorly either
yes there was some neat parts to the show but for me i wasnt expecting a story line  i was expecting to be wowed by all the acrobatic tricks and extravagant gymnastics and i left feeling jilted
theres table service and couch service my preferred seating arrangement
vending machine with snacks and porn
all three of us had the watermelon and crab salad which was sooo fresh and tasty
happy hour was a great deal
so flavorful and even moist
im a fan of this place
but thats the only negative
clean and pristine
it was edible but the price we were paying i would expect a lot better quality
this was my first visit to bonefish grill party of two
cobb salad was large and fresh and i thought was quite tastybut girlfriend didnt care for it
it is easily on the list of dont miss places in downtown phoenix
the owner nick is a first class jerk that blames the customers for slow business
as all has mentioned the poached oysters were amazing
my family and i had dinner here for mothers day and we were not disappointed
it was about 5pm and sure it was raining but the lights were turned down really low ready for the night crowd although it seemed a little early for night time lighting
we will be back and encourage you to stop in here for sunday brunch instead of waiting forever to get into the cracked egg
so to get it started right we hit up stk at our resort the cosomopolitan
other than the fries and a pricy menu  id probably give them another shot
what a waste of makeup
le plan b porte bien son nom au cas o votre premier plan vous joue un tour vous pouvez vous retourner sur ce petit bar du plateau
the brussels sprouts were amazing
ill come back here next time i am in town
enjoyed a couple of items from the happy hour menu during a one night stay at the hard rock the service at the bar was great very friendly
i will hit holsteins again for sure on an afternoon
i felt like i was in a strip club
unfortunately every place i have eaten at mgm for dinner has been a 1star
then you have people who are there for weddings so they are dressed for thatand you have your tourists in plaid shorts and tevas
izakaya style food is small sharing dishes that is usually grilled or deep fried
tremendous exclusivity feel to the establishment
most of the dishes tasted like syrupy american chinese food that you could get for 10  and i dont want to tell you how much i spent
like i said
it reminds me a bit of esaus in santa barbara at roughly the same price point
youd have to pay me and carry me up the stairs to get me to go back to marquee
let me say that thats the only thing i order there
but if you love your bourbon then you have to stop in here
this is a unique experience coming here
we also ordered a bowl of the new england clam chowder
theres no food here but they let you bring in food
its always good to support local businesses and this is one that deserves support
found this place on yelp last week
lovely vibe friendly staff and even have a west facing patio if you want a lot of sun
i havent tried the food yet
this time was just okay
wings are delicious as is the pork steamed bun and bulgogi
my entire dining experience was tainted
we were here and it was ok it didnt cost us any money free drinks thanks to some dude who approached my friend and of course no cover
ps i cant remember what two specifics i usually get but it looks like a huge big stick the popsicle and it is delicious
a lovely bottle red and good coffee to follow
its even better when the food is actually good and its really good here
the nonspecialty drinks were more reasonably priced however
the souffl is also recommended
the bartender and this customer in question were having an argument when this asshole apparently one of the regulars came out of nowhere and engaged in physical contact with the decent customer pushing and jabbing him multiple times all of this to the total inaction of the staff  do you like being cowardly assaulted when you go out to grab a pint
came here with two others and a baby and we were seated immediately
ive been in the bathroom since
there is stadium seating so every seat has a very good view
their tom kha gai was also really good with perfect amount of broth to coconut milk and a good balance of sweet sour and spicy
though npl boasts an extensive menu with lots of good choices im awarding a fourth star for one appetizer which might as well be an entree the delicious creative and wellexecuted bbq chicken ranch dip
the ahi tuna carpaccio arrived compliments of the owner as well as a dessert
the service was awesome and i was constantly checked on to make sure i had everything i needed
i got the chia ahi tuna and my wife had the scallops
and of course the nightly specials are still fresh and yummy
ill be going again soon
i regret not saying something at the time but the staff didnt seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place
he said all his items were average and underseasoned
i believe our sorso may have been a little understaffed as our server rarely came back to check in on us
crowd was good looking and even kinda friendly
it was really comforting  nostalgic to have some good new england food without the 5 hour long flight
im guessing pretending to take our order on his notes app
we literally sat down at a table adjacent to the bar and neither of the 2 drink servers there should have been more than 2 btw seemed to notice the 4 adults sitting there looking around and trying to get their attention
this is a no frills place but the food is good
house soup meh not a fan
so no food allowed in this club would have been fine by me if you had a better selection of food
anyway great selection of whiskeys and wines  and a staff w a sultry attitude
oysters time with my boyfriend and a bottle of justin cabyummy yummy and great company with our dear friend celebrating 4th of july belated
i got the dump truck 20 and it was delicious
we just happened upon this place thanks to yelp which rightly gives it a very high rating while we were in the area
from their brunch
service was also fantastic  our guy was so nice and friendly and made sure our waters and coffees were constantly filled
i sympathized with her bc she was the only one serving but its not really our fault
and i am full
had to ask a body guard where the f i was danced too much
my friend chose the fried calamari with zucchini and deep fried pepperoncino and i chose the calabrese salad as an appetizer
i just recently tried their cafe and their 247 steak special is my new favorite thing
had breakfast here one day
after hastily providing our ids to the doorman a girl tells us it will be 10 a person while looking in it is clearly empty
the rehab is 10 oz of ground beef and the relapse burger is 5 oz of ground beef  the absolute perfect size for ladies
first  the music is at some balanced volume where its heard but it never causes you to talk over it
for the pizza we had the carne margarita and the pepperoni
we were seated earlier than our reservation was for and quickly received water and only minutes later our waiter arrived
the manager is very friendly and i believe is running a very good operation
the chorizo lacked it and even the spiciest salsa seemed mild
high  time out though
they also have halfprice wine on sundays
though the full menu is available at the bar we always stick to the bar menu
now the food was sooo good
coffee was great
it makes for a hot scene though
it came with a choice of 2 or 3 filets with a handsome portion of seasoned fries cole slaw and a homemade tartar and vinegar on the side
the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items
it seems like there might be some management or organization issues
the bill was not at all exorbitant as the steaks are really wellpriced for the segment
im told mystere is also good but i havent seen it yet
half of the tables were plastic card tables and chairs with table clothes
the location is located in university city and it is definitely one of the best restaurants ive been to in the charlotte area
i will be back for the late night food
thanks for the experience
its my goto place for lastminute plans because its always a good night
how does the biggest chain of bars in clark county forget to stock basic things like domestic beer
appetizers are all awesome
even ruby skye has its good days and they can even look like theyre a  cool  club
i met my best friend there and all i remember is that the food was delicious and the service provided by the wait staff was excellent
sadly i went back a 2nd time this time with 4 other people and the cheesecake was different
i would agree that the service here isnt stellar but nothing horrible enough to writecomplain about on a review
i count perhaps 10 tables occupied at 745 on a monday
mr b got an order of tacquitos for appetizers
my least favorite dish was their cheese stuffed ravioli
would it be run down by the cuts in upkeep expenses that seem to plague lots of corporations and make no mistake live nation is a corporation
all in my experience here was nothing exceptional i doubt ill visit again for dinner
how do you expect us not to do that when you charge so much for beer
sweet potato tater tots so selfexplanatory and not really worth further description
we were very pleased with harvest
paid 19 for chicken nachos its supposed to be a starter which were huge
for 38 it is a very good deal considering typical chilean sea bass dishes are very expensive
talk about a finishing treat
during our second trip things took a turn for the worse
he was personable engaging and very approachable
served in a clear glass bubble shapped bowl was our chesapeake bay crab
all for under 10
i can only think of two restaurants where ive had amazing lunch buffet food that is rangmahal in hicksville ny too bad they dont have buffet anymore and bangkok garden
the place played jazz music for most of the evening and later dimmed the lights and played more electronic chill music
never even checked on us if were ok or if we needed anything else
fun place nice employees
i moved to pittsburgh from the west coast and thought i needed to try primanti brothers
this and the other location have close to the right mix
we went there a few days ago with my mom and grandma
the pork was a little dry but full of flavor
adulting  definition sipping one or two drinks staying within your cocktail budget and using all of your uber credits for your inebriated friends
the seats are okay but they get a bit uncomfortable towards the end of the show
the bartender had as much personality as the bowl of corks on the bar corks in a bowl 2005 called to say youre out of date and though im no spring chicken im sure i was way more than three standard deviations below the average age i observed on this particular saturday night
the wine list is extremely overpriced
that is one less thing the host has to carry
not in a were fuckin with you way but more of a we have no sense of self way
the good kinda ended there though
they werent very welcoming
the food was of good quality for a chain restaurant
we were pretty far back but i still saw everything very clearly
i ordered it medium rare as the chef suggested and it was perfectly done not dripping all over the place but still a handful
great patio in the warmer months
its a great atmosphere
years ago db used to have virtual reality type attractions in addition to the games and those were more adult oriented and fun
and i felt the oat cracker held up well and should be consumed in 23 bites
dan has absolutely no manners which turned me off from this place for good
ill definitely be coming back a lot more
my husband and i split the wedge salad fried chicken with their homemade buttermilk biscuits with honey butterstrawberry jam
they have no meatless andor dairy free entrees
the main dance floor could be slightly bigger
when i made the reservation i told them it was my boyfriends birthday and asked if they could do anything for him
i didnt like their chips and salsaone of the worst salsas at a restaurant everew like tomato paste
apparently this is where all the boys are
i guess he brought a pound versus the 12 pound
i gotta say after reading the reviews for this place i was pretty leery to go there
fresh sushi prepared and presented well
four stars would return
this is a sports bar in a college town
not sure what they are going for
well kinda sorta but this one is better
if i could i would rate this experience a zero
it is not a symphony but the noise coming out of the first practice
i also really liked the house coffee blend
only one room but it is semiopen so there was a lot of air flowing and it wasnt that sweaty
it was pretty lame waiting around for three hours for things to pick up
i would definitely say im disappointed by the taste of the food
i have no idea how organized and nsync they stay from multi tasking serving an entire restaurant and keeping up with all the dance moves never spilling anything and always staying on beat
double ipa was surprisingly smooth and very tasty
the kids shared a cheese pizza and it was absolutely delicious
we were the first couple in and were immediately seated in a booth down the first aisle
the service is extremely friendly and will direct you to try beers based on your favorite style
this place is pretty much one of my goto brunch spots and why i can justify 4 stars
like if it were a person i would ask it on a date
if you go im begging you to order the duck
finally watching the bellagio fountains as we peoplewatched our experience couldnt be matched
ive heard about sweetbreads and didnt know that sweetbreads was actually veal thymus glands
employees were so attentive and came by the perfect amount
i try to come back as often as i can
the food was underwhelming
we only had apps so  that is what i will  comment on so popcorn cooked in duck fat topped with garlic butterive done garlic butter on my popcorn and was good but didnt know it was duck fat so i tasted nothing new ff with shaved parmesan cheese and baconyum
we are from michigan and were in town for a college basketball game and i used yelp to find something for dinner
was pretty easy to get to by car and i was immediately herded to the 7th floor of the parking garage upon arrival
cant wait till my next trip
the chicken was perfectly crispy with orange zest infused in the crust
this place has great food and live music at least 5 nights a week
patio is awesome in the warmer months and during a game day this placeb is awesome
good times and great spot to mingle and meet new people
first was the cutlery lol  cant really eat with our hands at such a nice restaurant wouldnt be right
met some nice customers the boss was nice
the bar was virtually empty maybe 8 guests but it was early
now it wasnt a big deal because this kitchen is always super slow and we never get our food in order
cover was 10 i went on a saturday around 12 it was super packed
my girlfriend the meat eater got meat in hers and described it as stringyodd for tenderloin tips i think
i understand valentines day is busy for all restaurants but the overall experience was not good
dry and very little mac and cheese on it
the coconut curry soup is also fantastic and a great way to start dinner
i came here with my twin sister 2 years ago for our 23rd birthday and we had korean grill house across the street before coming over yum
while waiting for tiesto i was able to get a good feel for the place
casual but not too much
my husband and i celebrated our anniversary  there 2 years ago and it was our first french restaurant
every time i come here its just okay
the problem was corrected after talking to the manager on duty
the bartender lady handed the menu and the entire time we were there a good 20minutes never turned around and asked for our drink orders
the decor was great  very old world tikiexotica
that enough should justify a 5 but only thing id change would be the environment
two stars because they do have volleyball and the drink i was able to harass the bartender to give me was good
this is the 3rd time weve been here and its terrible
the wait is an issue on weekend nights so come early or be prepared to wait  the bar is pretty spacious
went here for lunch with my bestie
and a good lookin bunch too
because the bartender was drunkand not just tipsyalmost falling down drunk
typically after i eat here i feel like garbage and all my money is gone
we both had delicious drinks at the bar and were seated promptly
12 for a burger
i can not say enough about jeremy and vegas party vip team
for 950 you get 1  1 12 lbs of crispy golden fried wings and a couple of celery sticks
but no he was the most rude abrupt and inconsiderate manager ive ever met
ill order that every time i go and it truly is crunchy
my husband got the crab cakes
we arrived a little after midnight and waited a few mins after getting passed over a few times we flashed a fifty and finally got one of the doormen to look over the guest list
it consistently took 2030 minutes from the time we wanted to leave to the time we actually left
but the food was not good and the drinks were just soso
however they do have booths if youre willing to wait
it did not seem as warm as the original sandwich they sent out but if i was going to ask for them to exchange it again then everyone would be done with their meals and i would still be eating
do as the regulars do and call ahead for reservations
lobster in the lobster roll was okay but there was no other ingredients like chopped celery in the somewhat thin sauce
let me preface by saying that my boyfriend is the lead singer in a band so i spend plenty of time in many different establishments
if it were a busy night that would have been fine but there were only a handful of tables occupied
she only had a few sips and then left the pot untouched
the food is ok but nothing spectacular in my book
there was only one other table seated and lots of servers
if you want a good coffee and a great breakfast burrito with a side of major attitude this is your spot
vinnie does it with some respect one can tell it is all in good fun
next time youre in the area stop in you wont be sorry
its good for big groups and small
i did not get the chance to get our servers name but she was a brunette covered in tattoos
theres on across the street and one up the street
flavorful spicy to your taste packed with fresh delicious seafood big portions and cooked to order in front of you in a steamer
i honestly was expecting more from a place whose first page of there menu is boasting about the naturally raised antibiotic free and hormone free meat they use
the bartender definitely forgot at least one of the ingredients
and i dont think i could have an unsatisfactory trip there
theres a coolkids vibe here yet i still felt welcome
i can go into specifics and sing its praises in 1000 ways but lets just say that the cake is gustatory poetry
the way the place was laid out was neat there were a lot of different sections with different groups of people which was nice to not feel crowded
cons in order of occurance bread arrived quickly oooh turned quickly to ewww dry and bland the lettuce in my caesar salad was performing the backstroke in the excessive pool of dressing they mixed in dressing mediocre not homemade croutons good likely homemade
it had absolutely no flavor and the peanut sauce wasnt about to help change it
i totally get why it has its own place on the menu
there were some pretty unique dishesa sea bass with black truffle oil for appetizer was really good
vacillating between 2  3 stars i gave it 2 because its fox
while putting money into the machine at one of the bar areas for over fifteen minutes i realized i hadnt seen the bartender the whole time
we have never had a bad meal here
she was a fantastic lady and anything that reminds me of her i make a point to spend a moment reflecting  and where better than a freaking coffee shop
we decided to pop in without a reservation and they happened to have a spot at the bar
we ordered the hawaiian although we substituted bbq sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce
i like bars that have silly gimmicks like 1 drinks when a fire truck goes by
i also had the carne asada burrito delicious
our regards as she is a great server
go grab a smithwicks from the irish pub across the way then wait it out for a seat at the altar of new orleans grub in lv
the three star review is for at least someone answered the phone when i called
well we finished our 6 drinks and started to meander around the casino
vegetarian vegan and glutenfree designations are clearly marked making it easy to navigate the menu for those who embrace those lifestyles
15 more minutes later still nobody had acknowledged us even though the person we first talked to had looked directly at us multiple times
todayhowever changed all of that
i think this is more of small plates and wine type of place
the french toast was also basic as were the chocolate chip pancakes
i spoke to the manager and expressed our displeasure and to his credit he offered us a gift certificate for future use but frankly it doesnt deserve a 2nd try
youll thank me lol
to drink i had a casuela which was like a margarita in a bowl
we had both imagined the chewy goodness of cabbage  corned beef being the filling
mine was okay but nothing to write home about
dogfriendly and lots of parking for bikes
a rewards program that makes you want to go back over and over and a happy hour that really makes that easy
they were out of potatoes
seabass is market priced
the service can be either really great or really bad
led zeppelin smashing pumpkins bush soundgarden etc
its not the cleanest joint in the world but that adds to the charm
die bedienung war nicht sehr aufmerksam und wir hatten das gefhl dass ihr die arbeit keinen spass macht
is this a gay establishment or a trumpkkk rally
i have yet to have had any complaints about my time here
soho is a cleveland gem
guu sooo guuuuud
the menu is large and the food good
desert was disappointing
although the meat on the cubano looks like it is lacking there is enough on there to pull the flavors and make a delicious sandwich
wings night thursday night is half price wings6lb
each dance would first be taught in segments then practiced altogether but slowly without music then done as a group to one or two songs
i saw a couple get engaged there
the drinks were awesome and service was very friendly
my expectations of fois gra is similar to the restaurants in france so i am a bit tough with this
once i found it there is street parking available along with a small stone parking lot
got to try a new drink bon vivant still not sure what i think about it they certainly know how to serve new and different cocktails
lots of bitching going on and talking crap within the servers to other servers
thank you gonzalez y gonzalez for providing me with excellent fajitas and ice cold beer
but we were placed on the guest list so we decided to check it out
two guys ordered the grassfed bison steaks and those were pretty good
for my entree  i ordered the filet which was super tender and very easy to cut
wait 4 for a shot
typically the staff is well educated about the various beers on the menu and can give you some good suggestions based on your tastes
personnellement le got ne ma pas impressionn
its a great hang
dropped by for spinach dip and a drink
over a matter of a couple bucks they have lost multiple visits
we were sent on a wild goose chase
draft selection is amazing bartenders are rad
three types of oysters were explained with various flavour profiles and a suggestion was made as to order to enjoy
the outside is lined with chairs to sit and catch a bite
however new developments have occurred in my life
we arrived on a friday night so it was pretty busy but we spotted four free seats right by the front window
the bone marrow butter and bread pass scallops were amazing but for the price there should be at least 2 more only 3 on the plate for 3000
some stand outs are the cheese plate and of course the chicken and waffles
it was really good buttery with just enough salt and the cheese sauce really made it perfect
normally i wouldnt even nitpick over something so trivial but i also heard the other servers in the area ask for drink orders immediately and only offer bottled water
my husband got some fish tacos and he liked them although it wasnt as filling as my burrito
my kids love the big daddy chocolate cake
followed the directions to seat myself and sat in the main dining room away from the bar
my recent visit will be my last
food came out late then wrong and then when i asked for a manager after 48 min waiting for food no manager came to chat
the ambiance is wonderful and calming the service is spectacular and the food is simply delicious
staff drinks while working
other than that i love it here best pool in las vegas and girls can go topless if they choose too which it pretty funny  i also looked it up and its the 1 highest pool in las vegas
so not sure why im surprised
now to the stuff i could have dealt without
servers shannon and carolina waited on us and they were great
me a 6 foot tall man having to arch my arms up to grasp a fork and knife
cobb salad  which included avocado applewood bacon cucumber egg tomato blue cheese housemade ranch dressing and sliced grilled chicken
heres the skinny food great range of flavors and options on the tapas menu
the sugar factory is really good
the wait staff were extremely entitled
after a brief stop in the pop up bar miracle on liberty next door we head over to gg
this review is for the restaurant and the nightclub
forgot to bring soy sauce for the sushi
it wasnt happy hour and my draft bud light was 5
my only tiny complaint is that the booths are really crammed in the space and not the most comfortable place to sit especially when its warm
i got the same salad i guess i just really loved it haha and water
very snooty rude and entitled
if you are a craft beer lover and have not been here you are missing out
it is an extremely easy decision for us to say that black angus is a complete waste of time and money and there is an absolutely clear reason why we never eat there
my caffe toscano coffee rum bourbon and something else wouldve been good had it been made with coffee that wasnt weak
we stood up and left
do not miss dessert
arizona check it out if your in uptown or close to downtown
my clothing didnt smell afterwards either
except in getting our food on the table because about 5 minutes after our appetizers showed up there was our meal
the feel of the place was latenight even during a regular dinner hour which is unusual for the area
finally got our much needed  snacks and were making it back to our seats when one of the ushers stopped us to tell us that our beverages were fine but we couldnt take our candy back into the theater
sweet for my taste
let me type that again my wife ate what was called garbage
food was ok not fabulous but ok  probably wouldnt eat dinner there again but maybe the popcorn which is served in a bowl not a typical popcorn bowl but a metal bowl
i do wish they would shred the chicken instead of dicing it but flavor was really great
friendly bartenders great beer selection and the food at least smells good
the beers are amazing and the food comes from steak and stone the restaurant in the same building which is top notch
walking around in ny ny came acrossed gonzalez y gonzalez and we need desperately to relax our feet
best pancakes we have ever had
i was also impressed with their chicken and waffles less so with their hummas trio platter
some advice no need to wait in line starting at 8am to get your wrist bands if youre hotel guests
i am a silly silly man apparently the kind who thinks you can stand at a bar and order a beverage
it was presented exactly as i would have expected sizzling and all
we ordered the boneless rib eye and it lacked juiciness taste everything
born and raised
i loved the exposed brick the low lighting the fixtures the movies and the music
id recognize that overly sweet vanilla icing anywhere
there are three floors and they plan to have a year round patio space
its hard to obtain good cajun food outside of new orleans
the drinks were very very pricey but hey its vegas
second for being awesome
what happens in vegas stays in vegas unless you get a dui shot stabbed or catch some horrible disease
michelin rated and well deserved
the live music has  suffered lately smokestack lightning
great place to go for drinks food and watch a game
i should have heeded the warning because after 2 tacos the grease was too much for me and the 3rd taco was left uneaten
for food try the steak nachos
table was ready when we arrived and service was spot on
i am 61 years old and this was the first time i have walked out of an establishment in my life
make sure you sit in the first rows and preferably have big bachelorette sign and then you are up for a treat
there were pretzel crumbs instead of cheezeits and no meat
good local italian place
eds even has an app you can download for the latest on that
i dont know how accurate this rating is but i swear no cocktail here is under 150 proof
meal i ordered burger protein style which if im being honest always suck and it just something i force myself to eat but the meat was actually delicious and i had zero complaints
the ambiance is strange  trying a little too hard to be new york when were were looking for more authentic charlotte
if you want a go to place that always has great food great service and good atmosphere this is your place
we had some meat and potato loving family members come into town and bob taylors was an easy choice for dinner based on previous visits
the sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes
15 minutes before my lunch time i get a call that the restaurant is out of mushrooms for my mushroom wrap
such a terrible place
both were great
the andaman noodles were a curried noodles with shrimp and shredded crab meat
tea i brought my mom here and she loooved the tea
once i make it past and to the barpickup i can see my food sitting on the cold counter
regardless we are total fans of cafe zuzu and the valley ho and recommend it highly to visitors and locals alike
we made it about 80 through
service was excellent
i rode it the first timefor a solid 26 seconds
im all about comfort foods and i was excited to try this place as it offered comfort food with a twist
beautiful and delicious food                   this morning we had breakfast at the restaurant and the food was amazing the polenta was out of this world and do were the muffins eggs were perfect you dont know what your missing until youve had the bloody marys its a must have breakfast five stars all the way
thank you milk bar for having us
i got a side of cheese sauce to go with them
the atmosphere at nolans is top notch with many different settings from the fireside lounge to the patio and restaurant and even the bar is a great mingling area
meanwhile our server along with his help refilled our drinks and constantly kept our chipssalsa bowls full
we eventually gave up waiting for a table on the patio and asked for the next available table
the chocolate sunday looked divine
i found a white wine i liked and hubby found a good beer hes very particular
be warned portions are huge
2 not so happy moments
the bartender on duty was fast and friendly but didnt seem to have any beer opinions
pretty nice wine list
we had the peachguava juice orange juice mimosa and plenty of other great food
le service auquel jai eu droit  laccueil tait exceptionnel
being an all female group pretty much guarantees you a table and free drinks if youre on the guest list even on a frisat night
it was actually a slice of banana nut bread topped with some fruit and whipped cream about 15
29 per night resort fee which u find out about when checking out
i know what 3 eggs scrambled looks like and that wasnt it
food is good and well priced
sushisamba is located within the palazzo hotel and casino
i havent gone for dinner but if you are looking for a nice dinner that you cant go wrong make sure to stop by carnevino
come alone or come with a gf or even bring a date
im not normally a huge fan of those fresh cut style fries but these were tasty
it was a bit confusing at time but wikipedia helped fill in the blanks
i just cant understand how this place is in business
no comments or apologies from manager or the server
worth every penny
i believe theres free wifi so feel free to bring your laptops but beware the laser
when we got our check we spent more than i expected  25
however the food is incredibly mediocre and overpriced at that
no soul and no meaning
pints are priced around 350 so actually whilst a boring selection it is pretty cheap for edinburgh
that is all of us being fuller than we can bear with a generous amount of sake and beer as well
that was probably the best thing about our experience however it tasted like cream of mushroom soup out of the can and came in a little petite size skillet for i think 15 or 16 bucks
cant beat that
two man band playing lively modern hits
that is excellent value
got a laid back downhome feel and a lovely patio
be forewarned if you open a tab and give them your card theyll file it in a little index card holder then toss it around carelessly
as we came in it was very busy which to me was a good sign
customer service was good not exceptional
i found it to be somewhat bland nothing i would ever crave again but portions were large and made for pretty good leftovers
brew pubs are starting to grow on me more and more
bartender christopher is seriously the worst bartender ever
perhaps they could have offered another table for those that wanted to stay but they were very communicative throughout the evening
nice outdoor patio seatingdining area if you want to eat outside
happy easter
this place is way overrated
we figured you cant go wrong in an irish place
they do have a shuttle that goes there but it ends at 5 i believe making it more or less pointless
but for all it isnt and for what it is it is awesome
ill never be back to find out
for dessert we had to try the much talked about sticky toffee pudding and it did not disappoint
the waitress took about 5 minutes to initially come to our table so we told her we were on a time crunch via the hostess
the worst part was there wasnt that many people
lamb kafta slider with the gus ipa from full pint brewing company in north versailles
limited food in house but may be ok to bring in
i always imagined a jazz club as a serene dimly lit place with leather sofas a grande piano and a chick sitting on top of it wearing the tightest dress possible singing into her microphone while making sexual gestures at her audience
and again no cheese on those either
warm lighting jacuzzi tub shower with glass doors a great line of products body wash lotion shampoo etc
nothing but bitchy douche bags in this place
one of the best things about this place is their gelato bar which mike particularly likes but i do too since they have a bunch of different options
for starters i had their tempura calamari and she had razor clams with chorizo
they have a beautiful patio with games and a great beer selection
with apologies to all the young whippersnapper yelpers who never heard of him
everything was to our liking no complaints
we met up here on a saturday for a work group happy hour
total fan of this place
the smokinghouse margarita was horrible had to return
we sat at the bar which has some very cold barstools
we will not be recommending this place to any of our local or out of town friends
that pretty much describes my ideal bar
tried the pepper beer and was quite surprised by the green pepper flavor that was a little sweet and the lingering spice on the finish
be sure to try the beer battered french fries or anything from their weekend brunch menu
first of all their summerlicious menu had more options on it than any other summerlicious menu i have seen so far
so even though the margarita are 1416 its worth it when you get your moneys worth of liquor
this place tends to be crowded so you might have to order one to go or have to stand while chatting at the bar
i tried the smack yo mama which has pulled pork with some spicy sauces inside
love the music
my husband  was completely silent as he inhaled his  french onion soup
the lemon pepper season was sooooo good i will return for that alone
i have been here several times and have had great drinks and had fun every time
i did enjoy the over easy egg on top but thats pretty hard to screw up
my husband felt so uncomfortable cause she was acting so weird
everything was fresh and tasty
after all the lotus is the universal asian code word for vajajay
good service and comfortable surroundings
my sister asked one server if we could get assistance and we were told someone would be with us shortly
i had the black cod
yeswe all know that its not a fourstar batali joint
i get back downstairs to discover this massive chicken parmesan sandwich
some coolunmemorable decor
there were some amazing dancers twirling around in their cowboy boots
this place was also totally overpriced for the qualitymy meal alone was 17 and i only ate probably a third of it
weeks later i was watching the news and they were on dirty dining with a c rating based on a lot of thr complaints i listed
the place is massive and delightfully tacky
we will be back
there were pros and cons to each taco variation but my feeling is that if wed paid the full 4 price for each we would have been pretty disappointed
its a cute place
a spot to pass out after whole day of awesome adventures
the service was excellent
okay ive given ocean club multiple chances
the bar has a wide range of malt whiskies and an excellent menu including the famed cafe royal oysters try them rockefeller style however it is usually incredibly packed  you would be very lucky to secure a table for yourself most of the drinks ive had here have been at the bar
the broccoli was a whole top that was roasted and had crisp ends but not burnt  sort of nutty tasting it was the very best broccoli i ever had out
the patio has a great view in downtown near a lot of hotels the staff was awesome and the only disappointing thing of the night was that they had run out of oysters oh tear
yay for pittsburgh
those below who say that its really only good for vegans are either used to crappy baked goods or somehow came on an offday
so we did
i highly recommend it
the wings are really good too
dining experience  our waitress was pleasant and attentive
the manger alex came by our table to say hello
i never demanded money back
great experience here
i was here the same time as yami
we live down the street and came in for lunch
all the food was over cooked cold and gross
for my tacos i chose 1 carne 1 chicken mole 1 fish
fantastic deal compared to other places that serve menudo in phoenix
even the snacks are pretty big2 people could subsist on 34 snacks even
enjoyed the ambiance of a smaller steakhouse
staff is all very friendly and always paying attention to your needs
my favorites have been the merlot and the malbec
and its a doozy
since we had a decent sized group you got one bite and then it was gone
the noodles were too mushy and had little bite on it
food was ok
cant beat the location either which is a huge plus
they play loud music in the restaurant which makes it fun and unlike any other restaurants ive been to
we paired them with brussel sprouts finished in bacon and apple jam and fries
from someone who cooks and considers eating a sport i could totally taste that many of the ingredients had been bought pre made and frozen
i wonder if the owner was that dude who camped out for weeks prior to the stores grand opening and won all that free furniture
it has a kobe beef patty and thick layer of cheese and a slight creamy layer of 1000 island dressing and to top it off crispy potato chips which makes it not only savory but also texturally stimulating
5 mimosas always please everyone
she said the special was over and im not using the tickets
the service is always great
i guess the secret menu is where its at
we didnt have young children with us this time out but ohso does have a 499 kids menu with items like mac and cheese cheeseburgers grilled cheese seems like a lot of cheese but the meals include a drink and you can opt for fruit instead of fries on the side
really really good sushi we had the jalapeo bombs salmon belly scallops las vegas roll and crunch dragon
to their credit they are all super nice and attentive
would i go back
the beer is excellent and the seasonal rotations are always worth trying
he was prompt and the perfect blend of efficient and friendly
what the door is lockedthats okyou have to ring the doorbell to gain admittance
loved this place
seven months ago after years of waiting i was rewarded with tall boys
short story the dishes were delicious the service was stellar and the ambiance was warm  elegant
i have been coming to this location for quite awhile and have never had a problem like this before
the crop rocks deviled eggs are the shizz
maybe it was just the night that we were there but my friends and i didnt really enjoy it
mine was pad prik khing and hers was a curry shrimp dish
the chips and salsa they serve free
reserved a table for 4 left my number for them to call when something opens up
as soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted by name  by a very warm and friendly host who directed us to the balcony since we were a bit early
drinks never go empty plates are cleared sweeteners are brought etc
creative and smart business
the wine selection is above average for a place like this
apple cider brownie and chocolate bon bons
the apple desert was to die for
its passable fusion at best
when wines arrived we were advised that in fact there was a full bottle of heitz
once you have tasted the daily lip smacking specialized menu
actually a lot of pizza places blows this away
that was great
the irish coffee was a good way to cap off dinner
the response is something like oh this is what a tiki bar is like this is awesome
the bartenders were quick and made really good drinks  pricing for everything was average to everywhere else
would definitely recommend this place to those of you who havent tried it yet
its definitely a great place for students to hang out because of the cheap drinks and theres also a pool table at the back thats 2 per game
my tips  i feel when the bottomless mimosas are ordered your food order is expedited to get you out quicker cutting out what could be more time for mimosas
loved this restaurant
fun place for a casual vegas dinner
my daughter enjoyed her salmon burger
ordered a side of skillet potatoes got about 3 tablespoons of the tiniest chopped potatoes ever that were super overcooked
i ordered the hot chicks which were buffalo chicken pattiethings on yeast rolls with fries
i accepted figuring mellow is close to home and i should give them another chance
they do have complimentary valet but lets be real the valet boys here in america are working for tips so its not complimentary
i appreciated her honesty she didnt say anything negative about any of the dishes claddaghs offers but she definitely directed us to choices that she thought were more ideal
because they mentioned it at least 50 times during their show
there was a long hair stuck into the crusty food
my petite filet was just okay
it is not the gay club i frequented 3 years ago
my friend and i went together because we got free passes from our hotel and it was the best time we had the whole trip
it is worth a visit though
im a semiregular like once a week thats over fifty times per year and i still cannot give them any praise except thats its cheap sometimes when theyre not over chargingover ringing and its a good place to hideout for a while and replay some old music no else has and to people watch its amazing what walks though these doors here
our server was friendly  checked on us frequently
absolutely worth checking out if you have never been and like the beers
we came in here to kill time after visiting the hoover dam
authentic and hands down best in charlotte
i cant tell whether this place is from the hobbit or a vintage 70s slutty diner
my phones battery was still 85 by the end of the night because i was hardly ever on it
i forgot to order my tacos without onions and it had so many that i could not even pick them off they were mixed in
doesnt get much easier than that
flavor and portion were generous
my wife likes marguiritas  said it was the best she ever had i dont like margaritas  i  did like their house margarita i may have 1 next time
the beer is delicious with a wide arrange of choices and the flight
he told me that i have to understand that chef ramsey is not in the kitchen cooking or yelling at people
not sure how this restaurant gets the high ratings
they wont give you tap water
so if you are to make a reservation be sure to ask if young students who are nervous about their status with the restaurant are going to perform
roller derby and pizza what could be better
the hype is real and you better believe it
we ordered the kettle of green chili pork and it was amazing  honestly some of the best that i have ever had
always great service and the food is a top notch
the food was good but the service lacked a lot here
the bread plate is a musttry
it was a refreshing change of pace from the other typical watering holes and sports bars all around the city
came here today for their satsun brunch
we had a couple of hiccups along the way and the manager graciously gave us a couple of gift cards and truffles
it is a gastropub serving traditional pub food like sausage and mash and fish and chips as well as pasta options and a few veggie options thrown in for good measure
oh are you ordering whiskey ginger
the bar is just awful looking inside
so much better than fucking marquee
as far as wheelchair accessibility if you let a bartender know they can open the fence in back and let someone in a chair through the back door
this sports bar is multileveled has a dj playing has televisions that stretch from the floor to the ceiling no matter the sporting event from water polo to horse racing which i disagree with to hockey basketball baseball heck even cricket  jai alai were being broadcast
the best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around 8
taste  4 atmosphere  4 presentation  4 service  4 overall  4
would recommend 1010
we had a large party and got a table easy but that was probably just luck
the top sirloin was yummy of course the filet the pork and surprisingly the chicken were all great
it was surprising that a hotel which has only been open a few months seemed dirty
our one complaint collectively was that the burgers were a little more cooked than what we had asked for
12 dozen of their freshly juicy and tasty shucked oysters west and east coasts  the dips bloody mary cocktail sauce horseradish champagne mignonette heightened the oysters
also great place for a drink and just chill with some old good friends of yours thats if you have any
to add even more to your dinner give the italian margarita a try
had never actually been into downtown boulder city so i went down on a recent saturday into the downtown area to see what it was all about
be prepared to unbutton your jeanspants when exiting this establishment
the waitress was sort of clueless wasnt sure about the soup thats fine she just started her shift
i tried the chicken cordon bleu sandwich
bone marrow was good but you can taste that they put a lot of butter to it
he and i bought in for 200 each and had two hours before our reservations at the voodoo steakhouse in the rio where were staying
my father in law was coughing up a storm too
unfortunately for my friends boyfriend they slapped him with a 20 cover charge
not usually a huge fan of eating bread and butter but i did that too
the breakfast sampler is a good portion
perhaps my judgement is clouded because the airport is a large black hole of good food service and at reasonable prices
thats pretty much a piece of heaven if youre a beer snob like me d   if youre in down town madison looking for a great meal and a cold beer i definitely recommend this place
im glad i tried this place out but i wont be coming back
wine nice selection
the knots could have been better but the burger was super good
i had a lost coast brewery tangerine wheat
the seating lacks logic
im sad to write this review based on the staff but due to the rude doormen my whole mood was ruined and i sat down at the bar but started getting angry the more i thought about it and then left without even ordering
ordering the waitress tells us it will be more to add cheese to our fries
i was told they have games there too like corn hole life size checkers etc
it was appreciated
if j crew doesnt make up the majority of your closet dont expect to find your kind of crowd here
follow the yellow brick road the narrow black steps all the way to the tippy top and you enter a small but unique restaurant
that by itself should say something in an era when complaints seem the norm
as is usually the case with such restaurants the menu changes constantly to reflect what is fresh and in season
the atmosphere of this place was amazing
their guacamole was delicious beware that it comes with cheese sprinkled on top even though it isnt listed in the menu
thats a personal pro i recognize that
a bit apprehensive given the reviews but we really enjoyed the experience
the music was not very good at all
the menu looked really good
downside  poor bartenders that only know and are allowed to make the recipes their owner teaches them
fuck this place
i think its a great pub and im sure its really cozy in the wintertime
each type has the alcohol  written next to it
the wings were large and meaty but very dry as in over cooked
this adult pool at the wynn is great bc no screaming little shit kids
so i have waited tables for quite some time and like i said in my note that i left for the waitress this has to be one of the worst dining experiences i have ever had
we had the pork shoulder tacos for two which did not disappoint
go to postino if you want some really good food wine or conversations
the food ive had has always been mediocre and beers are priced a little high
service  very good and attentive downfall  you need to open one closer to my house
sat in the bar area not very busy this time and ordered the filet mignon again however this time it had a lot of fat and gristle in it
during nice weather sitting outside is a must
was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen hd version of pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time i went
after 20 minutes we had to flag down a different server to get a beer
oh and if you can hang with spicytry the tom yum soup with prawns and chickenits the best it can be hard to get in so i recommend calling on a weekday to get a table for the weekend
it was okay but i wouldnt come back here
i got the surf and turf
i have been to many buffets and the one at casino arizona is downright awful
dinners are just really really really delish
the beer i wanted on tap was also out which was a little disappointing but i understand it was a busy day there
five minutes later we were seated at our table in the back of the restaurant behind a pillar
finally on to the dead animal
when i leave after all this i feel drained from standing around for so long and frustrated because that was about an hour of my weekend night wasted
homemade whipped cream with a touch of  honey
decent selection and friendly atmosphere
our visit to the hard rock in edinburgh wasnt any different
if this was just a few miles closer to my house id eat here weekly
my fianc decided to take me here i guess i should not let him pick the restaurants haha
one huge complaintno apparent dress code
they were amazing
the salmon croquettes were too salty and frankly tasted like a frozen product
the music was great but overall experience was aweful the patio was subpar the stairwell smelt like human waste
what an amazing dining experience
we didnt want to sit at the bar because of the long line that wraps around right behind you so we opted for our food to go
this show is a hot mess
they make it in front of you and you can enjoy it fresh with their complimentary tortilla chips
the service was some of the best ive experienced
they had many gluten free options as well giving me a variety of choices yay
overall i will definitely come back
i already complained about this to the manager but nothing changed
then i got even more excited when i saw on the board sat  sunday funday with the sf giants logo
imho the prices are high for what i think its worth
the sunday night menagerie jam used to be a pretty big event with multiple musicians performing a high caliber level of music
i would say that i would most definitely be coming back
this place has good appetizers but their prices are too high
the beer cheese soup was very watered down the last time i went
the entertainment was outstanding there was a female singer young breakdancing boy and a male tap dancer who performed on top of the piano as well as a live band
and there is room to dance around like a crazy person
and free drinks in hindsight im a woman so free drinks may not be universal
buddy and i each ordered the kobe beef burger and couldnt have been happier
i came in around 545 and left after being completely ignored
this place is so much more than bar food
hello this was rated top mexican by guy f need i say more
if you passed it on and the next person finished the boot you had to buy the next boot
if you looking for a place to eat late and continue drinking at the same damn time you must check out
on top of that the summerlicious menu all dessert descriptions left out mentions of alcohol
5 or 7 dollars for 15 oz of meat or cheese is just ridiculous
on stage stood two men a guitarist and a vocalist also playing the guitar
lots of drunk college students made for an interesting night
we shared the meat and cheese platter which was great
the ratio was just a bit off
the chicken was very moist and flavorful and the truffle flavor was nice and subtle
i was really glad we found this place
the crowd is not young and hip at all
luckily we came prepared
we discussed if we would return and we would not
order a pitcher of bud light got the pitcher but no glasses that took another 10 minutes
well priced and great staff
i was in scottsdale for 2 weeks for training a couple months ago and came here a few times
their other dishes are either too bland or too salty
the balcony area seemed very cool but it was closed for our show even though the bottom floor was jam packed with people which stumped me about the place as well
die penne war zu al dente die sossen waren  so unsere meinung  nicht frisch gemacht sondern muss schon stundenlang vorher im topf gebruzzelt haben
their margaritas are good but a little on the pricey side for not being very strong
in terms of wings selections our party if four chose classic spicy buffalo bloody caesar caesar takes texas and honey mustardall among the popular choices as we werent sure what to choose
this is our new favorite las vegas getaway
i love your scottsdale location and your food is so good
they also have these waterfalls that are fascinating
the seating is cramped which isnt a big deal unless youre 2 inches in front of and next to very drunk women who must answer every rhetorical question about blowjobs by cackling and carrying on like a sloppy drunk
i am not from champaign but guidos has become one of my gotos when we go out for dinner
the music was great not too packed great service beautiful surroundingsall make for a fine evening
i was starving and my partner and i went here on a whim
a five star performance and show
i have been walking by this tourist trap for at least decade now
ach meines erachtens wird am salsaabend im oberen mainstream floor eine cd abgespielt
they have two other locations one on e charleston and the other on s maryland parkway
once you can say youve been once why bother again
but after having gone to many cheesy hole in the wall authentic barriotype mexican restaurants which by the way i do love the mexican fare at this place was near perfect
i caught rural alberta advantage last night and i was delighted
overall the food wasnt cooked portioned or seasoned appropriately
there was a bench seat for the older guest who didnt want to pedal though there was really no need to pedal with the motor
the atmosphere is dark dreary and dirty and our waitress was tweeking
prices on point
the waiter took our drink order then returned ten minutes later
i will never stay at that hotel ever again
anyhow aside from the super awesome mug the appetizer dish with wings potato skin wedges celery mozzarella sticks and a side of pot stickers was fairly delicious
it is not just a casino bar since it is owned independently and because of that i thought the atmosphere was great
great looking venue
well get there though otherwise kudos
went to tempest last week with friends and i really had no complaints
we will definitely be back
that was kind of awkward
after work on a saturday night i  wanted to chill with my boyfriend
i dont write many reviews but i do its because they are definitely worth it
of course they ignored us when we asked for a refund 5 mins later
but thats just me
said 2030 minute wait
i think i just assumed it was another gimmicky vegas thing and didnt want to pay for it
got there about 530 and picked a high top in the bar area with a view of the street figuring i would people watch
im someone who would pay for something that i partially ate no matter if i liked it or not
there is a bread guy that goes around to all the tables
you should definitely come here ill be coming back and ive never been to a place this good
the fact that they have a vodka vault makes it all the better
music was 90s and the crowd was loving it
i was told it was a non smoking room but they allowed us to smoke since thats what we requested and booked
i wont be back
they also have a lot of good wine and beer options christmas ale
i was again confirmed that i was getting a 2 bed strip view room
the portion size of chicken was small
youre right up against other peoples back yards but there is a barrier to give everyone a little privacy
went there before a hornets game
usually we expect to be asked if wed like to order anything else before being presented with the bill
the atmosphere is amazing
there was nowhere to sit or lay down unless you rent a daybed or cabana
the smell was just raunchy
also as i got to both ends of my halfcut wrap the end was just a ton of sauce with no chicken not really the best way to end the meal
the food is off the charts good
we really liked the dumplings and the save the tuna sushi roll
i can kindof see the attraction of this place for some people though
would i go back
my girls and i were on the vip guest list thanks to one of my friends boyfriend
the oysters were freshly shucked and some of the best ive ever had
ummmmim looking around and theres hardly no one in here
all of it
i cut it in half which im not sure was a good ideait just made a bigger mess
which ok is fine but he had a very sore attitude towards them
they expertly prepared the dishes  infused so much flavor and spice into both it was heaven in my mouth
i actually used the tarter sauce it came with on my fish tacos
to my delight i was able to replicate the delicious arizona heat wave at home
our main course consisted of beef larb chicken panang curry and kai koowah
i really miss the old cheers
we both ordered the roasted half chicken
liked it so much it finally pushed me to write my first ever yelp review
lastly there is some band or something that performs across the street outside the city center and if you try to sleep early the music will definitely borrow you
on tap selection was great and i would go back
the first drink was 5 then the second was 6 and the last guy was the winner for douchtardedness
you think the price is great
after reading that the resort had changed ownership we decided to give give the restaurant a second chance
they sat us outside as the resturant is 18 only good thing it was a beautiful evening
should have gone for the fish
the food was so good that we headed back two nights later
artists and bands perform for free here and that is rare to come by so be a little nice
we came here on a saturday night
i think we were expending a cooked breast but regardless it was tasty
i am not a big fan of russian restaurants but this is a great place to go
anyway the frozen margaritas were good and i ordered the street tacos which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty
i have heard the happy hour specials at the keg are pretty good
now how can you party hard in vegas without stumbling into drais
chicken enchiladas were terrible  could tell they were cooked and left to reheat under a heat lamp
habenero cheeseburger comes with a glass of milk will light your  on fire too
awesome devils lake red lager and wings
great selections of champagne and scotch
i enjoyed the pancetta flatbread as well
they make it fresh right at your table
they have an excellent drink selection and i especially recommend the ginger pu erh with a bit of whole milk
i definitely recommend this place if you are a beer fanatic
my husband ordered the cuban sandwich and it comes with a delicious broth you dip your sandwich
thanks to josh we had a memorable experience and loved what he picked out
brandon was great with the transaction
food is awesome
if i ever become famous enough to be featured on the food networks the best thing i ever ate i would definitely be going on a 20 minute tirade about this meal
nice room but floors feel damp and theres absolutely no toilet paper
it was like a totally different restaurant and one that we would go to again
the brownie sundae was also a skip it
we decided to try to see if we could get in after seeing andrea bocelli and the restaurant was awesome enough to stay open past its hours to accommodate us post concert goers
the ambiance was great and i will be back to try some of the other dishes
never again mark my words
lets get something straight
the dj was spining rap songs about hos and pimpingi dont know but it was a total disconnect from the whole beatles theme
gumbo was fresh
we started off with the calamari which was a surprisingly big portion for a small plate
thanks yelp for this hidden gem
i and a friend went late on a saturday night
great beer eh not so much
the chicken sandwich was fried in a beer batter and it was so greasy the breading was falling off it wasnt that great and the bacon on it wasnt seasoned or anything it was just average
ive had the mojito which was a little sweet for my liking but still pretty good
its a little too ladies who lunch for me during the week
overall i have always been pleased with zocalos customer service
everyone went out of their way to make sure we were happy
great spot the owner is real nice and the tap selection is one of the best in the east valley
i am really torn because i find it hard to contradict years of sentiment and foodie dogma and i am thinking that perhaps the true gems of los are specialty items that i have yet to order
i never have done a review like this but this places service stinks
good beers on tap and pretty good choices for wine as well
duh of course when i voiced my displeasure on my checkin it cross posted to twitter and the reply was altogether different
it is strange
the smell hits you instantly when you walk in
the only thing they got right here is you can fill out a survey  make comments
and that girl at the front needs to lose the attitude
food and service was really good
we got the pitcher then was pressured into buying shots when we just wanted a beer and some food
i was very much in the mood for it that night and felt a little let down
the mealbegan with some fresh bread which was solid italian bread with great accompanied oil
went there with a friend last week
i took my mom here while visiting on vacation she assured me she will now be a regular
i had the brown bag chicken sandwichso delicioushow can you go wrong with avocado goat cheese and huge chunks of chicken on your bun
its a very nice sandwich but nothing to do with its cuban counterpart
and the oven chips
the honey bbq was delicious
first off the place is beautiful and we were seated promptly even though the place was packed
she then tells us she has only been on the job for 2 weeks and i can see why
on the back of the menu there were over 30 different combinations for lunch specials
food was soso but its not like youre going for the food
i ended up taking my son here for lunch
i plan on coming back here for sure
it was not bad but i was disappointed for the most part
sitting outside is quieter than inside but its relative
atmosphere was very enjoyable our waitress was fantastic
next to tao this is one of my favorite clubs in vegas
we came early enough to secure spots around the pool in the back and somehow as the day went on the front pool got busier and busier while the back pool remained a lot less cluttered
dont recommend walking in but for delivery it hits spot
the kirsch ice cream was very good with the sauce and rich chocolate mousse
i think all stars beats most of the other joints for wings
they do use great high quality ingredients but you definitely pay for it
however zach in the bar is so arrogant and cocky that i will not be eating at the bar anytime soon if he is there
i only returned because my mom chose prosecco for mothers day brunch
wont be back to another chilis
on that second visit what i got were some unseasoned chicken wings fried hard as shit
waist of time
the regular bartender is highly competent and doesnt bother me with talk if i feel like drinking in peace
also you get your own server who helps you pour drinks if youd like
service is also quite goodi tend to get annoyed in the us when their service provides too much attention i know something silly to even complain about but i found that here they made a good balance of paying enough attention to get you drinks take your order etc
beautiful restaurant inside caesars palace
he comes back to the table and still no sign of her
they have over 1000 different kinds of beer
we ordered a bunch of stuff including pork cheeks squid fried brie which was delicious a sea weedraphini salad which was a bit too fishy tasting and were satiated
i love this place and it never fails to impress
they do have a full service bar here
oh and side note they confiscated drews plastic sword but were nice enough to let us take a picture of him taking it from drew
so refreshing and delish
but oh my
this place is my favorite
food was absolutely terrible ribs tasted like they were frozen and then reheated also had the cajun chicken pasta tasted like kraft mac and cheese with some dry chicken on top we will not be back to this one
during the rest of the year i daydream of the day for me to reunite with my truest love once more
the beaver is a tiny diner on west queen west
dessert peach cobbler with ice cream i would say pass on this
c  the wait control  as much as the wait with  your anxiety at a higher level the control by management of the list is also proactive and top notch
either lights by the tv didnt work or they didnt have any switch to turn them on
met a friend who works at the adjacent hair salon  and ordered four selections from the bruschetta menu
id definitely go back and order the exact same thing or maybe try a different variation aka get any type of meat burger topped with lobster
this review is for bar
the club is filled with very tall very skinny very tan very boobilicioius and very blond girls in shorttight dresses and the douchy and nondouchy men who love them i also saw a few cougars and some of them looked like the famous tan mom
however i think the security guards are pretty stupid and their rules are dumb
what an amazing experience from start to finish
we were all very happy w our lunch
we also got one of the drinks that are made with dry ice which makes smoke come out of the cup which is very very cool but once again nothing amazing
the potatoes were really overcooked dry and salty
vodka  soda 450
i like this place ok but their nachos are a disgrace
nny is getting 2 stars because the pizza was subpar compared to the other slop that locals try to pass off as pizza here in az
if you havent checked out the encore nighttime beach club youre in for a treat
pork chops were good but ive made them better before
good selection of beers frosty cold
the atmosphere is always so fun because the people are always having a good time playing board and card games and the staff is friendly and hard working
it is quite loud and dark in there but i did not find that to be an issue for myself
when we left at about 1230pm there were lots of people waiting outside for a table
bill burr tom segura rob schneider mike birbiglia have all been through not to mention countless others
it was the worst dining experience ever
i got there 15 minutes before it even opened and there was a line
i was really impressed how friendly and helpful the brooklyn bowl employees were
it was very messy  and this is coming from a clean freak that disavowed those carls jr if it doesnt get all over the place it doesnt belong in your face campaigns
there are heat lamps and a huge firepit for cold nights
clearly the first time didnt make enough of an impression on me but i was say that this time did
it stays open until way past the sun coming up good luck with that you crazy party people lol turnt vegas baby
i think i figured out why this place is called the cage
funhipster vibe with 3 levels  lower lounge first level bar tops second floor billiards and bar top tables
i just cant imagine the people who hang out at this bar are drinking up makers so that tells me they dont stock well
outside on the patio they have a pretty streammote whatever you want to call it with the misters a great combo
until we see improvements in service we will be eating take out from beez
there were 4 of us and we all got the 25 package which included a jacket gloves and a drink
the rice according to my mom the rice connoisseur was not
its a very laid back atmosphere
i hate to hate so let me just go ahead and lay out what happened 1 saturday night group of 5 looking to go out in ohio city
theyve cleaned the place up a bit more now but it still has a fun vibe
what annoyed me happened next
ordered a hamburger to be safe and instead of mayo they put tartar sauce on bun
the steak was great however the person who decided to add a pound of salt to the outside for seasoning clearly made a big boo boo
bartenders were much friendlier than other staff and earned a good tip
its a great little spot to do happy hour with friends and people watch
he came back with my tea and made the hostess bring me a menu they werent stocked she practically ran with a menu
best jazz house so far in montreal the sound is well leveled the mood is chilled the musicians are awesome kim richardson and the pianist definitely deserves to be recognized
lol we were the 1st ones there and i had read reviews about coconut water in their mojitos so i had one or two
the good point seated right away but got screwed because we got the bartender as our server
moved to a table and service became very slow
the guy knows the menu like the back of his hand was able to do multiple recommendations and the food was kick a
oh and an ipod alarm clockdock was there too
a little spicy but not overwhelming
we shared a flight and i found some new favourites  the shiny whiskey and the revel  liquid gold dry were both great
it was a great pick for our last night in vegas
our chef at the table was pretty entertaining and he had a few fancy tricks up his sleeve setting things aflame and showing off his knife skills
every waiter that ive had at this location have been attentive friendly and knowledgeable
from the orgasmic sounding menu and hood locale to unique interior and restaurant name tuck shop seems a smidge more concerned with hip originality and nice touches than with bedrock delivery of food and value
i tried the other restaurants and keep coming back to this one
the folks working this outland and the other in ballantyne know cigars and they know their inventory
i had the house brewed saison and my husband had their ipa
we were seated at the bar and admired the bar tenders brewing up some elaborate cocktails as well
if you get it as part of the tasty menu it comes in a ceramic ramekin
the server was kind enough to take it off our bill and now im aware for next time
never going back
good wine selection
all in all a great experience
try to see some drag kings as well
im still giggling with the image in my head
overall a decent dining choice located inside the mandalay bay but i would check if its possible to make a reservation in advance
website needs an update
the kitchen is the saving grace
the waitress did feel bad cause she had told us it is fresh cooked to order
recently visited here for lunch around 1 in the afternoon
with a bit of assistance maneuvering around tables a wheelchair or walker could do fine
nice bar with friendy staff and sky 3d tv
the restaurant looked a bit crowded but service was very good
phillys has a good amount of food to pick from
we stayed in a basic room at the wynn i was intrigued that they brag about how the room took five years to design but i think most of that time was spent at the craps tables because there were some fairly shocking basic design flaws
it pairs well with pastas pizzas and beef
there had to be some type of coating to get it like that
very friendly staff too
the absolute best thing about grit  grace is how laid back it is
i came here for lunch and it was so good
everything else is not bad i think its a preference thing because there were things i liked that my boyfriend did not and vice versa
they could cut that menu in half and still have too many options
im not saying we are never coming back
the hot and sour soup was the best choice of the evening
the drinks kinda took a while to come out as well as the bread we were a big party but it was not busy at all
great menu decent prices good portions and the ribs are amazing
i ate that part last because i assumed itd be typical and difficult to eat but the flavor of the apple mix was amazing and the tender flakiness of the pastry took it to another level
great service great waitstaff great food
its a younger atmosphere than most local gaming bars in the area
the complimentary chips and salsa were great
was pleasantly surprised by this tavern
its a very traumatizing thing to have a performer pass during the act
we were visiting wi so my family and i didnt know which places hit up
although it took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive there were a few thing wed adjust about our meals but still good meals
this place is flat out cool
a brioche bun for a burger is pretty overkill
they have tours stop here from the looks of it and they had parties of 30 people come in which lead to lines at the buffet
the menu was kelseys like as someone else mentioned
the food here is really good
best mexican food in town
i hear their catering is awesome but maybe they are working out the kinks for a restaurant
long story short we wont be back
our waitress was absolutely amazing
of course things taste better when theyre fried but that was a bit much
which was 50 i wasnt expecting her to come back and grab the slip before we left but guess what she did
ive had better
there are loads of other shows during the year and i know a number of big comedians made their start here including kevin bridges
it was dark
if you want good mexican especially pork dont hesitate to eat here
honestly the allaround experience of coopers tavern gives this place a unique style
the bartender created some amazing looking drinks and entertained us
kyle is the man
im one of those annoying adults who goes to a restaurant and orders grilled cheese and fries off the kids menu because i love grilled cheese so much
other than my mild hangover and resulting post bourbon haze the brooklyn tavern healed my pain
such nice and friendly staff
its cool that you can purchase growlers to take home that could come in very handy
this place is  really nice
the man who waited on us was very nice friendly and accommodating
bring me my food
not a real buffet fanthis place is acceptable
i had read a review on yelp about contacting jennifer manager beforehand about specifics on our reservation
the food was terrible and not worth the wait
price wise it is a bit more expensive
why can this place not get it together
anddd with great food options
nice relaxing bar inside the vdara by the lobby
they have the best beer selection in all of las vegas that ive seen so far
i mean its a desert
oh yes my friends this is a steak housemore like a steak heaven
i told her the drink tasted horrible like matcha mix and tap water and i did not want to drink it because it did not taste good
the atmosphere is fun and funky
he liked it though
this was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience
it is inconvenient and im sure has lost them plenty of money as they just lost my business for dinner this afternoon
the porch was perfect for the scottsdale weather
there is no dance floor another minus
owl is a dark divey bar with good beers a great craft cocktail menu and an ominous looking bird of prey on the wall
guys and girls i highly recommend stopping in to watch any pro sports and to grab a drink thumbs up
when going back to my room at 1130pm leaving a shitty time at senor frogs i heard spanish rock mana
and uh it wasnt great
i had the italian salad and the meatloaf
i cant remember his name but i think he said that he was originally from southern california
i was concerned it would be different
starters glasses of red wine bread basket a variety 4 or 5 different types to choose from
i like the burgers the steaks are ok the seafood items are pretty good
i took one bite of the duck and couldnt finish it
make it a mark with a vamped up menu including some real island apps
the entire back page of the menu is vegan yay
the hookahs themselves are of the highest quality keeping the tobacco going much longer with a much better taste
i ordered the chicken gnocchi and all i could taste were carrots
she also had no clue if they offered any season selections that might of had fruit flavoring of any kind
i thought the bananas could have been a little sweeter but it was pretty good overall
my brother and i ordered four small shareable plates and we were stuffed
look you cant go wrong with black dog
it all made for a very enjoyable and memorable christmas eve night
i usually stick to the pepper jack grilled onions and bacon if i really feel like treating myself
the crab cake appetizer was the best i have ever had
this was not a quick stop
the bill was confusing and even after the manager explained it to us it became apparent that communication is a skill they lack
you can do better
oh my god does it get any  better than this
we had high hopes
found social house and made a reservation
seriously i mean this is it
best authentic street tacos ive had in arizona
we walked over to the bar to grab some drinks while we waited the bar staff was friendly and took our order right away
reentry reservation entry and general admission
not a huge deal just one of those things
i got the fish and chips which was good  but the quantity was a little less than desired for 30
i just came by to compare the ratings to ocharleys because i just left there feeling disappointed and annoyed with myself for trying there again and im shocked this place has a lower rating
food was great
the drinks always fast and perfectly mixed
the bar is clean and beautifully decorated the staff is friendly and knowledgable and theyve got a great selection of beer and liquor
parasol down is super with its additional outdoor seating with a great view of the fountain and nightly water color light shows
no really its just hamburger that is after we asked what the entree was and how it tasted
joe was a great waiter
this hotel offered a shuttle to our reception venue which saved us some money only 1 uber ride home after midnight instead of needing a ride both ways   the room was what i expect from a hilton hotel room
great beer selection and nice happy hour deals
other than the speed of the service it was a good evening
it was a pretty good experience
although topless is not my thing i had a good time here
the service was stellar and really felt more than welcome
the best customer service and knowledge
at any rate this is perfect place for anyone to be among friends
our table got no drink refills and we had to chase down our waitress to even get the check
we and plenty of others thought it was located on the corner under the big sign so when we walked in it was empty
im not even a stout man well i am stout just not a usual drinker of stout beer  but i love coffee
came here w a party of 30 or so
first off the staff is wonderful
he had recommendations knowledge and a great personality
would i have made a burger like this at my place
ive ordered the melonies turkey wrap for lunch on several occasions and its been delicious every time
if you get the opportunity to go you should
first the service is outstanding
in the greenhouse tavern i felt like i was being totally ripped off here less so
for the entree you got to choose between fish and meat but when we ordered the meat they didnt even ask how we liked it cooked
at that point i should have left but we stayed
we then refused the chips and then she informed us that we order both chips and salsa and nachos which makes no sense
i am exploring the charlotte area and i  will be returning
what the heck
the reason to hate this club is due to the overly packed dance floor irrespective of long weekend or any regular weekend
the venue is tiny compared to others such as encore
felt like i was eating an onion salad
heres the things we got
its also pretty expensive you get charged for everything tomatoes sauce whatever
the only thing i really remember about this night club is how beautiful the ladies bathroom was
juicy tender and flaky
these tasted like i was eating the grill
i really think it was only because we were fashionably late and they were already pushing people out of the tailgate and into the stadium
the way the restaurant is arranged it can be a gauntlet navigating through it as well my sympathies to the wait staff who are excellent by the way
after talking to management they told me they were too busy to look into my issue and they would call me back when business died down and never did
she seemed very annoyed by this
thanks a lot
just make sure to be at your club between the times they tell you and you shouldnt have a problem
i recall that in my inebriated state i asked if the tax was the catch
came here on st patricks day because we were looking for a bar where we could just get a drink and chill
the beer well it seems to have high scores but i didnt find them particularly interesting
wow what happened to chilies service
20 for this one tiny room obnoxious crowd bouncers on the power trip horrible music like really
service is good but heading out now for another small meal or great dessert bcs it wasnt enough
also their specialty drinks are half price
dessert was good
awesome location in old montreal
and dont get me wrongthey are ok but i guess for pizzas i rather go to places ive rated 4 or 5
thankfully we didnt miss panic although they are no longer a favorite because all the lead singer does is add screaming to every song and it sounds like a little girl screeching and weezer who were amazing
mostly everything is gluten free on the menu and it is stuff you dont find too often fried pickles fried oreos
simple menu but great tastes
my date liked the blood orange margarita though
when i finally finished all the toppings apart from some jalapeos which are a little on the spicy side for my mild palate there was a only a handful of nachos left
i do like the pool tables
i didnt see these on the menu online but the meatballs are there and listed ingredients are fresh ground imperial wagyu italian sausage and veal
great beer selectionblack market brew left dreamsicle wow
a nice warm pasty would go really well sitting outside at the cornish pasty during cooler weather and after finishing an event like a game
it did take a few months after your grand opening to get you operation running smoothly
in other words i understand there are regulars but do not allow them to consume all your time where the new person at the bar is ignored
husband and i drifted in here today on a mooch around town
i ordered a blu cheese burger and asked for it to be cooked medium and it was beyond well if that is even possible
i usually never want to get my food remade because it will always be cooked rushed even when you tell them not to rush it because you just want it right like it should have been the first time
theres nothing special about the wine list but the choices are alright
the pimientos rellenos stuffed piquillo pepper 14 consisted of only two stuffed peppers
well worth it
this place has been around forever
for me this show was a hard 2 but ill give them the benefit 3rd star since we came on a holiday evening though i think they should have just gone dark that day if they didnt have a solid lineup
thats unheard of
thats it ok then this one guy told me to go to joes section btw i made that name up well there was really a joe there and since i was with a bunch of girls it didnt matter so we walked through the hall into the man floor the cramped white room floor and onto the area near the dj booth omg awesome wait is that britney spears swiggin champagne
all flights come complete with the requisite water and chocolates
i live too far to come here regularly and it wasnt super impressive for a drive but it was nice to try
i went to this venue to enjoy an event the whiteout all white partysad to say after 1520 min of attendance i was forced to ask for my entrance fee back  exit the premises
kinda weird but you can get the idea
my husband and i celebrated our 1 year anniversary here
i figured id give them another chance especially because my family loves the food
come on this is vegas
not sure why all the one star reviews this place has decent mexican style food
of course when the fairies came in to clean they would fold it ever so carefully
if you get to the restaurant right when they open you dont need to worry about reservations yet
while i am cool with the low key vibe of a pub i still like being served and when it isnt busy dont expect to be forming a queue of one at a bar
i topped my dog with chunky peanut butter and chili and it was an excellent choice
the food arrived after not long
i got the pulled pork with bananas and the chipotle tomato soup
they do have a decent beer selection and food as well as pool tables and darts
i find it a little weird that people can just walk through a restaurant and im pretty sure i saw a few homeless people wander into the bathrooms but whatever
love the dark atmosphere and music
bring back the lunch specials
i was there for 2 hours
upon entering one can enjoy the colorful fish in the saltwater fish acquarium
i was at the encore casino gambling and decided to take a walk by the pool
they were just standard tots but cooked to a nice crisp
food was delicious
the waitstaff all had on authentic germanbavarian garb and they couldnt be nicer
there is alot of stuff happening around you and there chicken waffles seemed like a good size portion
lastly we got the oxtail croquettes
everyone is dressed in lederhosen and quipped jokes and encouraged us to dance and stand on the table
horrible excuse of a theater
both times the server introduced himherself which i like since i hate saying excuse me to the air to get someones attention
location was good cuz we seen concert at the joint
they also served hot dog paninis
they also have these really spicy hot peanuts out as bar food pretty good especially with my cold cheap bottle of stella i feel weird giving only four stars but i wish this place had a pool table or two  central tempe needs more places to play cheap pool and this place totally has the vibe for it
lots of brownie and tasted amazing but very very rich in flavor
very happy to have dooneys back
especially with such an amazing food scene happening in pittsburgh right now all i have to say to james street istry harder
due to the fact i work weird hours at work i miss the 46pm happy hours around town
like a couple of other midpriced options would have been nice
had a solid champagne glass of mango juice for about 7
other than that though the atmosphere here is nice open welcoming
the parking area are spacious and the presentation on the food looks good
i have found all the staff to be friendly often funny and genuine
so we leave and walk a couple blocks to edgar hypertaverne where i spent my birthday last year and have some drinks served by nice employees
i know there are bugs in restaurants but you can at least say something to us about it
sicuramente se avete voglia di un tacos andate l
dont go if your hungry
i had the mule which was ok but expensive
just to start off with i had a very good experience the first time i walked into the location on indian school
while i have had limited experience with the food served there ive spent a few evenings in the football themed pub on the second floor
riding up to the 107th floor in 30 seconds really helps if you are scared of heights
ir comes with tortilla chips and garlic bread slices for dipping this is a winner
i ordered their house grapefruit soda
the manager came by to ask how everything was and both of them asked us to come back
ive tried a number of dishes on the menu and each item has been better then the last
since the food was already cooked the waitress rang up our bill included a 20 gratuity even though all she had done so far was bring us waters and take our orders and we had to wait another 20 minutes or so before we took our food home drove 20 minutes back to my house at at it there
it was a huge portion enough to share with 4 people
the red salsa was very tasty
heyits the drew carrey bar
i absolutely loved this place
perhaps more sugar in the crust
most tapas places to me are very lazy with the presentation
and its right beside a free water taxi that takes people to the west bank of the flats and back
since we just had a beer i dont have too much to say the bartender was very nice the bowl of nuts that we were served was delicious
when i got back with my order my fries were cold and my order wasnt even correct
not quite sure if this technique is really professional or even more efficient than the old fashion way but i guess thats just how they do things here  i have no problem with that
great irish pub
we were seated in russs area
one saturday evening my bf and i checked out wildfish for the first time
oh did i mention the food
i will be back for sure
25 minutes preparation time  so pace yourself or youll be on round 3 of drinks before ya know it
must visit for corned beef particularly on st patricks day
i went up to the hostess desk which is perched up above the rest of the restaurant
we came here with a group of friends and acquaintances to celebrate toronto fcs victory nearby
this is definitely on my list for must return to
we finally went up to the front and had to beg the hostess to get us a waiter
vegas definitely needs a little tech house
the lobster bisque and bread were about the only good foods served to us
my wifes entree was the soy cream louisiana chicken pasta 15 rich and spicy
this is going to make for a tough decision the next time i go and try to order a burger
the staff is friendly and attentive
i found a new hang out yay
cheese sticks were exactly as if youre at like applebees not amazing but its korean place i would be the retard or i expected jaw dropping cheese sticks here lol
will be back
my salmon was delicious but otherwise im unimpressed
save it for the daytime or relaxing at the pool
after my holsteins visit i dropped by gordon ramseys burgr restaurant at planet hollywood
i brought all of these to her attention after she had to literally be sought after and she flipped out and walked away
no offense steve your wife is hot and all but the giant chryon light show of just her eyes facing the dining room from behind the bar was a tad creepy
we are going to start saving for our next anniversary
full of meat favor and the fat just give another layer of taste
between the two of us we had  1 koong sarong deep fried prawns wrapped in bacon and rice paper 2 nam kao tod minced sour sausage mixed with green onion fresh chili ginger peanuts crispy rice and lime juice 3 yellow curry chicken 4  pad swew chicken stirfried flat rice noodle with egg and chinese broccoli with black soy sauce
tiny portion of fish even
all along our server dori has checked on us to make sure all is well
i actually asked them for a lunch menu and they told me that is our lunch menu
dont waste your time or money here
its another beer celebration
the lack of a high chair speaks volumes about the type of neighbor they plan to be
i walked through the restaurant looking for someone to seat us and found someone coming out of the kitchen
great brewery and open atmosphere
i like how they converted this old brick building into an open welllit space
next youre brought a baby bottle of either red or white wineyour choice  its bottomless
the first floor collections and experience rooms are great for interaction
once we nestled up to a high top menus were promptly set out and drink orders taken two iced teas on this warm saturday afternoon
but the service favors locals visitors not welcomed in my opinion and experience
we were left in the corner of the bar with another group of patrons to eat our food and watch the entire restaurant have a great time with the staff while we were ignored
called ahead and put my name on the list quoted 20 minutes
i went with th erosemary foccacia  kale salad  flatiron steak and  frambois
the food was very good with an amazing selection of food
i have gotten good service in the past but today it was horrible
crunchy aromatic and gooey this grilled cheese sandwich is definitely one of my favorites in town
im partial to a game of knob touch from time to time and in bar salsa youre in good surroundings to achieve a new pb
both were cooked perfectly
the mac and cheese was amazing as i left no noodle behind
for our lunch we had the mac  cheese 2 which was ok considering the huge chunks of bacon that came with it
all round good boozer
its robust flavors will make your taste buds dance with glee
the size of the portion was huge and worth the 1395
we ordered thai chile wings as an appetizer and i ordered the gorgonzola chicken salad
so glad i went it was fun and the singers were great
the people working were super friendly and the owner himself delivered our food
i could see perfectly and i wanted to try something ive never had before
it was hearty  quick
it had me and my girlfriend saying i wonder what they ordered and grabbing the menu to figure it out
i really like their creativity in transforming it from the old irish pub to the knew hipster kitchen and bar
brad is the best he knows cigars better than anyone
the beers on draft are decent
ill spin better tracks and do it for free if maduro will let me
the service was slow a little uncaring and unavailable
it was just around the time when they were about to start to serve the regular menu instead of breakfast but service was great and told us we could choose from either menu so no need for any michael douglas falling downscenes
great sports bar with lots of hd screens extremely friendly staff and good pub fare
the tortillas were fresh and provided great corn flavor
if you can get past the sloppy branding i would recommend stepping inside and trying some vegan fair
has such an amazing time
the onion strings are pretty good with ranch
they have a fantastic beer selection there is always beers i had not tried yet
i was exicited to come here because i had heard good things and i am very enthusiastic about bbq
first time here
i ate the whole thing
a variety types of food on the menu
craft brews from charlotte and other parts of nc are prominently featured but there were also some interesting choices from other parts of the us on our visit i enjoyed two delicious pints of wicked weeds pernicious ipa which isnt the easiest brew to find on tap
i tend to come here with the lady friend from time to time
she saw this xyz the tavern on yelp and checked out their reviews
and id give it two thumbs up for happy hour
everyone should come here at least once in their life time
sit at the bar
tried their lemon bars today
zumanity is sexy
i did see that draft beers were around 5 so ill probably choose beer next time
its usually pretty busy every day of the week friday and saturday though its pretty packed so be prepared
austrian pronunciation for back
the food was sub par
i saw one fry karaage and takoyaki battered banana another grilling black cod and brushing miso sauce while heating up bibimbap stone bowls
came in on friday for late lunch and had to come back for breakfast the next day
it is a dive bar so do not go their expecting anything else
we were told that there was a problem with the pretzels and they had to be redone and since the calzone is made in that oven we had to wait
when i used to go there was always some bald guy snoring super loud in the back of the room smh
they even had brooms and i joined a pick up team and we broom balled until most of us were quite bruised and battered from playing
the reason we only gave 4 stars was that the corn and bread was very tired
the llama was really delicious
oxtail chili cheese fries the portion received could easily feed 4 people who are also ordering a burger
i went on a tuesday and the drink special was the greyhound
great food and atmosphere
we walked in and i immediately saw the unappealing and ancient pizza slices that were sitting under glass looking like they had been sitting there for days
the salad was small but tasty
he said hed rate the flank steak dinner with roasted potatoes a 10
if in the area and craving for thai maybe worth a visit and its a nice trendy unlike a typical thai restaurant ambience
now for the food porn to say the bacon burger was decadent is an understatement
the noise level predictably does become quite high when the place is pretty crowded
until i courteously passed him my glass over to him just to leave me alone
ill be back
one wouldnt expect a sandwich of fries beef and coleslaw to be tasty but in fact it was
the staff was great and the people there were so much fun
visited the oxley for the first time a few weeks back and thought this was a nice concept pub ramped up a notch to be just a touch more sophisticated
it was my second time getting it and i will probably get it again
we quickly ordered food sensing she wouldnt be back for a while
we immediately got thrown out
the salad was good as well
id be remiss if i didnt mention the great patio area and the live jazz i saw setting up as i left
i enjoyed my first visit to wooden vine
food   garlic prawns  the best
i did enjoy the chipotle sauce on it
the wings with jack danials sauce were awesome
justin timberlake taylor swift some rap some hip hop a little michael jackson sprinkled in
i had the chicken parmesan sandwich with parmesan french friends and oh my lord was it good
perhaps next visit
i did notice our server called the gemelli a fusilli but they do look pretty similar and i didnt really mind bc either way the dish would prob taste the same
never had any issues with the waitstaff uniformly friendly and efficientgrew up in westside charlotte so this is like going back homewith dishes named after my old junior high school herbert spaugh and my old street camp greenehow can one beat that
well i enjoy eating at the bar section because theres loud music and the service is a bit faster and waitresses are friendly
kudos to that
weve eaten thai in the depths of thai town in hollywood and some really great places in long beach and thisi have to sayexceeded in quality and authenticity
ill probably check back in the next time im around  pros its gordon ramsay lol
i started with the white fish croquettes which were pretty good
i will never give this location any business nor will anyone i know
it was more like a toasted dried out dinner roll
now its known more for their beach volleyball courts out back and being the only driving range in the city than an it place to go
it started getting busy and the gal handled almost all the tables
lobster was overcooked but the shrimp scampi was very well done
upon a second request it was explained to me that he did not want the tvs on
we were over charged for all of our beers
aces and ales has a rotating tap list that is never the same twice
the seats are amazing the food is great and the service is awesome
the felit was amazing
as the name alludes their fresh tortillas are really their signature item
it has been quite entertaining everytime i go there
you wont regret it
ambiancelocation  located at cosmos hotel
nice place with a live cover band playing 90s hits and a friendly bartender
goes above and beyond
b the pricing doesnt warrant frequent visits and c its pretty far from home
the other tables were also part of our retreat but we decided to dine in separate tables
they dont have a lunch buffet but the 2 things we got  chicken tikka masala and chicken korma were both awesome
no offer to bring those to add to salad
he finally said well i can take it off your bill i guess
and please im not knocking appearance im not a barbie type person but i do expect people regardless of age or size to look presentable meaning clothes fit properly clothes are clean  neat
overall a wonderful meal
i barely finished mine
their pink vodka sauce is light but flavorful and the crust of the pizzas was woodfired perfection
however the food is not all there
the tickets to the night shows are 350 for each night
the waitress came back with news that the managers had found some root beer for me and brought it over
this place is great
there are tons of options of games to play from jenga cornhole bowling darts and more and this is the attraction of this place
but food is always good
i had the rail trail wrap which was chicken lettuce carrots and provolone cheese inside of a pita
the location of this club is in a really nice hotel
came upon this place the other day and went for lunch
food was great
even on a busy night there are at most two people working the restaurant floor  service is quite slow but you dont mind it so much because you are enjoying the ambience of the restaurant
it is essentially edamame with a twist no kosher salt but rather lime wasabi salt and a garlicky soy sauce
parking is easy lot right near by
ok so what do you do in vegas with a bunch of  coworkers after the trade show has just finished
the service is great and they are very attentive
it has the bones of the old jewelry store of the same name that once occupied the space in the heyday of euclid avenue as a retail street
ribs are my favorite but its also awesome on grilled chicken breast or on wings
they have an eating area both in the bar and around the lanes for parents with kids bowling
at any point in time if he would have just said hey i apologize were really short staffed today im doing the best i can and just basically pointed out that he knew there was an issue and that he was trying to fix it we all would have been completely fine but nope never did
and when all your going to order is water that suxs sitting there thirsty  waiting
id go back to see if the drinks have changed
the most romantic and intimate restaurant on the valley its truly a celebration itself and should be reserved for the best occasions
now they explain there is triple sec in the margarita although i did not request an upgrade of any sort
i like this place because of my politcal views
remember it is a high class fine dining restaurant so you will pay high class fine dining prices
not as they are described with specialty toppings that i feel make the tacos unique
again it was only fun for maybe 10 minutes
all were good good
simple  our room was over tryst the hip night club
what a deal
looking for good sauces and a full course meal
i heard the peppermint pie
this was fine since i was still waiting for my party to show up
really it is difficult to have a peaceful meal and enjoy your food when people are making a huge noise while you are trying to eat
the elevator lines both on the 2nd and 51st or however high it actually is floors have no organization whatsoever
no explanation needed there
great cocktails also
sls has something special its an unusual and innovative little minicity amongst all of the other minicities in vegas but sls is more like a mini beach town city on the coast of somewhere chic
the staff seems to really have a connection with the customers which is what makes eating out an experience
not a lively bartender and i will not be back
i think it would provide a much better atmosphere if we could hear the games on the speakers
im sorry but no it is not
my husband was clearly worried about this adventure as evidenced by the fact he had disappeared prior to my leaving never bothering to call
the pool party was fun
do not go here
although i dont like beers my friends did really like it
we liked it so much we took our favorite dancers advice and went back during the day around 4pm
and darn it we were too full for desert  and i cant forget the live music a few feet away from our table
yes and no
definitely not impressed
also includes lots and lots of fun eye candy too
the service was outstanding and the food was very fresh and better than expected
not too many smiling faces and they seemed young and not into it
i havent really had real good mexican food until i came here
talk about having  issues
the bathroom attendant talked a bit much for my taste or perhaps bathroom attendants creep me out in general who knows
i went here last night for the first time
its been a while since ive been to shadyside when someone asked me to go to marios i was confused
what a cheesy place for a concert
they needed to stay away from fried or fatty foods
i have some peculiar dietary restrictions and they made it very easy to have a phenomenal dining experience
my bf had a steak caruso dish and he was impressed with it
most of the area is covered by tables and sunbeds which you pay for of course so its not not very spacey if you dont go deep in your pockets
i dont order those any longer
they threw away our empty fat tuesday yards even though they were empty
the shrimp cocktail was all about the shrimp with large fresh tasting shrimp and a bowl of cocktail sauce
very small portion
they were well made and generous with the honey garlic sauce
she slammed the drinks down than walked away when we were ready to order
the staff may not speak great english but they are friendly and know what they are doing
overall we left with a lot less money then we should have and without a typical vegas memorable food experience
i ordered the famous banana pudding and the hubby got the 12 chicken and two meats with two sides
i think the best part of our evening was the service
ahhhhh stlouis wings
second time i buy tickets in advance and plan a trip solely to see a guest dj and do not have a chance to see them
i ended up with some desserts too
the waitress didnt bring the olives that i order in my margarita
turns out it was just about the end of her shift and she mustve just been ready to go
i heart milestones
i didnt give a full five stars because i still think 100 for a ticket to this is a lot but definitely see this show if you want to see a cirque du soleil in vegas
in my previous vegas adventures i have stayed in the cosmopolitan a couple times vdara bellagio mgm and new york new yorkthe big grandeur wellknown vegas experience
the restaurant is beautiful open and had ambient lighting that made catching up perfect
like get over it guy its 3am and youre clearly not going home with anyone so stop being so angry at the world
they always host the booty shaking contest which is guaranteed flashing of some ta to you boys out there
the manager behind the bar didnt seem to think that was an odd thing
think of the 1930s eramae westart decoamelia earhart but youre in a brothel
ive learned the menu selection is huge with all the variations you can choose like having chicken on the nachos instead of pork etc for beer my personal favorite is the dirty blonde but they have a large selection along with a full bar
if i can help it i eat here at least 2xweek
the pomme frites were very crispy
we stayed 5 mins
best part of this night was the band
thats right im speaking to all the kids who wasted countless amount of their parents money in quarter form
the produce looked fresh and of good quality
for entres my brother found a simple burger and fries so he was happy
this has to be  by far the best prosciutto i have tasted in the us
washed down with a great bloody mary this place set us up well for the whole day
we ended up going in to try the food  theres no waitstaff for the dining tables
offers a very eclectic irish bar setting with a great selection of beers
reasonable price and they do not overcharge for delivery fees
found hair in my food on several occasions
i like to hang out at this place for happy hour
wash it down with a great craft beer or a moscow mule my favorite
im guessing the thieves know this also because there is no camera coverage of the bar dining area of this restaurant
the one bartender i worked with was nice
they also add sour cream as well
if you want a decent drink you meat wish to go elsewhere
i really enjoyed my experience here
the bartenders at the bar were quite nice
chimichangas were amazing
i think this type of place really rely on good staff you need all your meat bring to your table
the sirloin was also delicious cooked to a perfect medium fully covered in black peppercorns and served with a clove of roasted garlic
still the atmosphere was nice and dinnering was wonderful here
so why two stars
i got a nice breeze through the window as well as nice city view
if you think hot dogs are boring think again
did not like soup was more like tortellinis in a very thick beef flavored gravy
after going over my whole order it wasnt that this place isnt good
the buffalo mac n cheese is super yum
this gay bar sports pool a jukebox and low low prices
atmosphere  awesome
wouldnt waste my time
music is so beautiful and really deserves a lot of recognition
the food was ok i had the house specialty beef short rib enchiladas
i was a little nervous to go here again but it seems like the have worked out some parking lot issues by adding another parking lot south of the building
joey is trendy it wants to be trendy it is obviously trying  very hard to be a cool spot to eat drink and socialize
and parking will always be troublesome so try coming earlier than your reservation because you can spend a ton of time looking for a spot
i know  thats the dumbest thing ever to complain about
this restaurant is a great addition to this area
had awesome gluten free options as they prepared the fries in a separate frier and had gluten free bread and bun options
the baked apple pie vanilla ice cream only i hate maple everything i know how uncanadian of me   is so heavenly  next time im ordering that first before my meal
she just waved it off and said the only difference was the seasoning
great place to eat in downtown chandler
i like sneaky dees but it wouldnt be my goto place for a saturday night
and if you have more than 4 people expect a horrible wait time
with that said there comes along a few inspiring ventures that try to bring the same expertise and dining experience that some of the better restaurants in cleveland have to offer only closer to families in the suburbs
my friend told me great things about this place so i stayed here a couple months ago and honestly terrible experience
i blame the stickybuttoned controllers
i would not visit this location again
we went upstairs and there are tons of kid games
when they arrived just before 1am and the general manager krista koller wouldnt let them in because they didnt have their ids on them
5 stars for the quality selection and speed
with all of the meets being bonein they really infused some great flavors
i got a wedding cake martini
not wanting to offend the drunk my friend said   no were in like
the band was great playing songs that had people including me
attentive professional and courteous staff that appreciated our desire to keep a handle on the budget for the meal yet still treated us as well as the high rollers all around us
service was excellent front of house manager was excellent
looks like third times a charm because i was finally able to step inside the glory that is peppermill and loved it so much that i came back the next morning for brunch part two
the cauliflower was delicious and i would definitely order it again
the menu was extensive
apparently theres also a nice fire pit in the other room which i didnt get a chance to see
pricing for the top of the line system was fantastic and steve even provided me his personal cell number rare these days should anything go wrong
as the name implies they really know what they are doing when it comes to booze
she proceeded to state that they were sauced but the mild and medium sauces were more of a buttery sauce
it may have been the kitchens fault and the food was still good
the appetizer the escargot was delicious it came with warm bread perfect for dipping into garlic butter
dont expect much here
its laid back here and i love coming here with my friends to grab a cold beer and some pizza or wings
loved my night at rok vegas
je nach dj ist die musik super leider nach 24 uhr zu leise
small portions so be prepared to throw down if you are hungry but amazing food decor and ambiance
45 minutes to wait for a table only to watch other people walk right in and get a seat
we arrived to the ambient restaurant and were quickly seated in a booth
granted ive never had vip access before in my life but it was kind of nice having people pour my cranvodkas and serving them to me free of cost
i had the chocolate plate for dessert and it was amazing
the waiter that we had was very knowledgeable fun and super friendly
the drinks are fairly cheap which is a plus side but it does mean that attendees are usually pretty drunk so there is that kind of atmosphere in the club
it was too much aggravation for me to go back but aside from the rice being a little dry the food did end up being decent
i was so excited when they built the hotel palomar at city scape
its not as circusy as you might expect a cds show to be
the club itself is spacious
but was not impress with the food
only tried a couple of things to nibble on while sipping champagne but nothing really stood out
the cons however is that we waited a long time for our food
id love to go back to this place during dinner rather than happy hour and have another nice night out
the waiter just said that the first tax was for one plate and the other was for the other plate
def try the ribeye its worth the 50 bux
we snacked on those while deciding on the rest of our meal
just came here last weekend
my friends and i flew from hawaii
she was young so she didnt have too much input on questions on the menu
5 wines and beers  any mixed drinks not cocktails
drink prices arent ridiculous eitherpretty reasonable for vegas
the hotel itself is beautiful
they need to find a better way to communicate
i love the area by the fire
scottys menu atmosphere and location have potential but they need to figure out food service if theyre going to have a regular following
try mr hos burger for a very different experience
i was due a chocolate molten cake and mike was due a pistachio milkshake
ensures you dont miss anything and the general reaction from the crowd will let you know if you did
ive read other reviews and i cant imagine giving this place anything more than 2 stars
the decor is very urban
the ravioli in vodka sauce was excellent
she was actually very friendly but just not prompt
no ball game no derby nothing was really going on sports wiseso you would think service would be better
what a hole in the wall site
menu is small and delightful brunch beverages are excellent
the music was pumping and the party was loud
weve been to other locations
friendly bar tenders servers even the managerowner who knew the client i brought was talking us up the whole time
my spouse  i consider ourselves to be great tippers as we eat out alot
they arent afraid of the spice of you crave it ceviche chorizo salsas
i had a great time and left with a fantastic bottle of tempranillo and some lovely art created by a local artist quite the productive night
id probably recommend this place if you are looking to get an appetizer with a drink
that guy was awesome
glad to see this quality of service and food up at boca park
i have been to this place couple of times
it is a little off the beaten path if youre just driving through
i grew up eating my way through north beach wmy grandmum so we are a bit snobbish and jaded when it comes to our italian food
everyone took care of everyones customers
yes i might and will say this
there was a waitress tending to the group i was with who provided good service
view of the bellagio fountains was second to none
id definitely come back especially if i get my hip hop music going
thanks again christina
wonderful pirogues and beer
the place is pretty small but cozy
wasnt crazy packed either so our food got to us pretty quick
that just went to overtipping the super friendly staff anyways
the restaurant wasnt even busy which was the sad part
strong and spicy it helped knock back a sore throat in a matter of minutes and helped me get back on my feet when i needed it
four of us are everything was great
oh and the views are priceless
i have yet to have a bad experience here  now that ive got my boyfriend hooked i know we will be going back soon
the bands are pretty awesome i love the drinks and i love that the crowd is mature and sophisticated
everything was expertly prepared with balanced flavors and appropriate portioning
i had the french onion soup  it wasnt baked but i didnt mind
we both also tried some pumpkin whoopie pies that were also great
i would have sent back the dish if there was better service but at that point i was famished from not eating all day
i mean wow drinking in a chandelier can be pretty dangerous if you are not doing it right
weve been visiting regularly since its preopening event last year i even proposed to my nowfiance outside of the restaurant after enjoying a romantic dinner there
while the food was good it is expensive
22 ounces of pure bliss cooked medium per the chefs recommendation so the marbling could melt into the steak
and i will try more yummy foods
the music is all kinds of different
visited the local for the first time and really wasnt impressed
the prices are low
sounds like your typical british pub right
i never got up and left before but im really glad we did
why do you think im still moving towards the restroom honey
from what i could see it looked like it could be a great place to hang out
i am not a foodie
i am a computer engineer for a healthcare company
its always a fun place to go
props to them for keeping up with our orders
schliess mich den vorrednern an food ok preis leistung ok service nicht so toll
personal simpatiqusimo y extraordinariamente guapo la chica que nos atendi cortaba la respiracin con solo mirarla de lo guapsima que era y lo bien vestida que iba
sorry for the inconvenience
the layout of this wet willies is actually nicer than the ones in savannah and chucktown
stage turns upside down on its side sand falling like a waterfall and the amazing actors running up the stage like its butta
i am a regular at this restaurant
things of which i was not a fan  my chief complaint was the salt
everything and i mean everything we ordered was absolutely fabulous
food is average pizza is not that good and they never change it up
their shakes are delicious
during that 30 minute he told a group of mexicans to go away because he had to be selective he made 2 overweight girls cry when he told them to go away because there wasnt room and he let in a ton of underage frat boys and fake boobs in
i thoroughly enjoy both the red and white version of sangria
this was flavorful and delicious
such a fun inexpensive experience
just a quesadilla with a small amount of guac and sour cream on the side
and to be clear i am not overly sensitive to salt
for dessert i had the nutella milkshake
chef adam lambert was out and about in the dining room
this bar is fine if youre staying here but its nothing to seek out if youre at another hotel
we sat outside because it was a beautiful fall day
both of our main dishes were lukewarm not hot and they looked like they had been sitting for awhile
ive found the ingredients very fresh and im looking forward to trying other things if i can get myself to branch out from the lamb
pequ de poco aventurero y no me atrev con la hamburguesa de haggis
the girls here are hot the hottest of all the vegas strip clubs read next review
they have great shows and are really supportive of the local hiphopbboy scene which is cool
it  seemed as though the staff were not trained on all the aspects of the shop most just bumbling around behind the counter
set your bookmark and go
no she did notbetch
prices are much better than dave and busters
the hookah they have is great very yummy
it was delicious
since the first time i walked through the door of this bloor west village restaurant a couple years ago ive found it a hospitable place with a great menu
she was attentive and super patient in answering all of my questions
i enjoyed this show very much
it was a little busy so we had to collect a stool to sit together
the bar is set so that the main focus is on the ice rink
to say it was delicious is an understatement
we have had some great chefs too
the food was average
not the best experience but i come here often because its a popular spot right by my house
i even purchased a groupon and was finally able to get him to go last night
im not sure what happened maybe it was an off night or something
the burger was overcooked and overoaded with onions
if you are a chicken wing aficionado  then you must visit
again nothing that ruined the meal but it is clear they are working out some kinks at the cf location
im hesitant to write a review as i dont want anyone staying at southpointe to learn about this little gem located right across the street but its so tasty that i just have to rave
everyone in our group no matter what they ordered was happy with their food
i thought the service at mix was very good but the food was about the same quality as mandalay bays other lackluster fine dining spot aureole
my sandwich was solidno complaints exactly as described
one of the best happy hour spots in town
this is a nice place to get a drink or an appetizer with friends
i love this place
i had a steak which i notice isnt on the menu anymore that wasnt bad but did not meet my expectations compared to the lunch
this is one of my favourite edinburgh bars
i came here for lunch without a reservation and the restaurant was pretty empty so i was able to get a seat at the sushi bar
not only do they play all of the games with the sound but they have a great happy hour as well 375 for a tall bud light as well as food specials
the restaurant was busy around lunch time and i can certainly see why
the chicken bites were great
i love how the only two options are scrambled or over easy
i guess these guys had a staff party the night before because 3 of their staff loomed around the bar complaining about being hungover while i waited for service
absolutely must get this
we too were lured in by the hostessand her offer of half off food
we brought our own fun to counteract the grumpy grumpsters behind us
i go for the salad and soup
for 25 that seemed like a steal
the bartender did not want to go through the hassle of voiding the cc transaction and instead said hed refund us cash
i also asked for a recomendation and the waiter answered by saying something was really good his favorite etc
i like that its close to my apartment but id rather stay at home with a bottle then venture to the saloon
based on the reviews this place might be better for happy hour
the service was prompt and the beers were served in their proper glass
it comes with the concert experience though
the 3 burrito is excellent but you really cant go wrong with any of their options
the burger wasnt seasoned properly if at all and the fried green tomato tasted like the flavorless fried cornmeal mush that is so popular in appalachia
you had so much potential
she took my payment and then i was out the doorfast and quick
this restaurant is garbage
not only did i have to pay extra for chips and salas at a mexican restaurant but i also waited 48 mins for some tacos just for them tacos to be dry no flavor  definitely not worth 54 of food at happy hour at that
the waitress was great and explained how everything worked
i enjoyed myself there
i hate this club and people there and dont think bellagiothe bank  has any prestige or values
considering we ordered as soon as we got there because we knew about the 2hr limit waiting 2hrs for food seemed a little crazy
the waitress warned me about this so my dude and i shared a meal vs having leftovers we had to drag around all night
a large waiting area that is very modern with some light fixtures akin to a 1970s attempt at a futuristic home
it is kind of annoying people walking back and forth the whole time and while there is more space between you and other people it still gets distracting
surely the wasabi purists would point out that they were most definitely made with wasabi powder rather than the real thing but the flavor was amazing
our server was very friendly and accommodating so i give them a thumbs up also
note if you come to this show you can get a free ticket through myvegas on facebook or the mobile app
haha thats how i read it first intense
this was the worst nightclub experience ever
i know why they have 5th in their name the street they are on but not sure why they even have wine in their namethe wine list is terrible
after addressing this with the waitress the manager comes over
my new favorite spot for sure
tryst has a clubbyloungelike feel to it
so i was super impressed when this place was the exact opposite
i very nicely told her we had called ahead of time and no time limit was mentioned  nor was any time indicated in the fine print of the groupon itself
not sure if the oil was dirty old or not hot enough
so much fun
high class trendy and really comfortable
our waitress said they were catering a banquet for over 100 people next door that same evening so not sure if that factored into things
well it is ridiculously expensive  and i come from monaco so seriously
appetizers during happy hour are only 300
simply one of the best places i have tried till now in toronto
i went back to the bar to see if i can get my change
it was appreciated and didnt go unnoticed
came out here for a girls night and had a fantastic time
had like 5 beers on tap and more in bottles
the service was not good  4 of us were served food that was barely warm
served at all different temperatures that seemed incorrect for the dish for what we ordered anyway
the fries are fresh cut and do not look pretty like fast food places
do remember though that the patio is next to a bridge that overpasses the train to the east of the restaurant
ive been to prime mastros sparks alexanders etc and this is heads and shoulders above the pack
but what of that other small corner of the menu
besides i got the clear impression that customers are not important
amazing bar food in a relaxed atmosphere that i highly recommend
family owned and operated
perhaps other dishes are nicer but we probably wont return to find out
the saying goes you pay for what you pay for
ive dined here when it was brunch and also on just a regular weekday lunch where it was a lot less busier but the food never disappoints
what an absolute joke
the service at the bar was perfunctory nothing bad but nothing that stood out as great service
this was so unprofessional  by the time we finished one plate to move on to the next it was totally cold
imagine the lockin fun with that
the place looks clean and the decor is cute with a couple of old school video games scattered around
hubby and i recently went plant based and were excited to try our first veg restaurant
the service was great given how busy they were
must go here when youre in town
then you should be fine
the food was great
the curry was delicious and just spicy enough asked for level 2 to give you the heat without the burn
i went here around 20056 if i recall and it was much better
maybe not so slow cooked
but small and too dark for me
the service is of the best in town and always a good time
wed heard and read really good things
and the fans going in the patio area made it bearable to be out there
this is my go to quick bite when at phjust always say no to blondiesbewarereally bad
movie paraphernalia framed gold records lava lamps minifootball helmets like every little boy collected in their youth and more
unique combo but seems to work
so although it comes with a price the view is amazing the food is delicious and the service was great
she said her crew just wasnt on tonight so she comped our 12 dollar burger but we still left paying 17000 tab and i ended up stopping at nnout to eat dinner since i never got one
bonus points for having draughts other than the norm
their name is an extension of their sister restaurant caf 56 which features 56 types of salads
i had the grilled haddock taco  skip this
we then realized we had been waiting an hour for a table
our waiter was sweet and incredibly busy so as long as my glass was full i was feliz
id do it again
vanity overall is a very sexy club
its a supper club serving steaks not a steak house that looks like a supper club go elsewhere for a steak experience
i opt for the 14 lb
i cant help but rate 1 with the terrible service we received at the restaurant last weekend
were a thing
well there is no line
you can stay as long as you want and we lasted about 65 minutes
not a good first impression
we would primarily stop by for six packs and maybe a beer since my best friend lived around the corner
the one common attribute to both meals was an over abundance of fries
after he went by a few times i stopped a busser and asked him and i had a container of sweeteners in no time at all
some people dont drink because they could have a low tolerance or are pregnant
it is walking distance from fremont st it is very clean
this is by far the best club i have went to in vegas the best part about it was a lot of honeys  girls and there was actually space to move around
you dont have to read any reviews  just go and eat
i got a little tired of the drive everytime i needed a putine fix
most managers apologize and try to make it up for screwing up an order being that one person has to eat 20 minutes after everyone else
worst place ever
seating is also limited because of the size of the restaurant which is very small and when it fills up the place gets pretty loud
im being spoiled with all the good places to eat around my place of work i called my order ahead before showing up
when you go make sure you try their fried spicy green beans with their homemade ranch
it was boring
our favorite side were the baked beans
overall the place is lovely but i cant see myself returning unless i have a couple grand to spend and just cant make it to vegas
they cut them in half and serve with a robust mustard
you cant spoil another persons day because you are not in the mood to be nice
i tried their pizza which was not the best brick oven i have had but very good nonetheless
feel free to check out my other reviews to compare
from reading these previous reviews i chose bar smith as the rendezvous place for my birthday
this was delicious had a little spice to it and man i wish there was more
not over crowded for a rainy saturday
good place to grab a lunch and a beer
and i am picky person
ive only seen djs so far but the music selection was always fresh with tunes with many i havent heard before
the property had a scent that made it smell so good
if you havent been well you should fix that
it will take 34 to make a meal so the chips and salsa for 3 may be a nice add on
the take home point of this review is order the sea bass
our bartender got very busy so the owner stepped in and helped out a lot
we were a group of 11 people and we enjoyed our time there
i met this one chick that was leaving for the night and she stayed for a last dance i paid her for
we sent them back because they were tough
i was very happy at this point
ive never had a drink made so poorly it was undrinkable which i cant say for other bars in the area
first my server was the freaking bomb
orstick with happy hour and some appetizers
no ice machine in the story tower two phone calls and 3 hours before a mostly melted bucket of ice was delivered
since i didnt do the ordering we had a bunch of other dishes that my friends liked but i wouldnt know the name
theres nothing around you can walk to
they should start playing better music downstairs
4 out of 5 stars only because of the lack of coordination earlier on at the venue but otherwise an enjoyable experience
though the faded type is cool it isnt all that functional so please back to dark solid font on the menu and the happy hour menu  i had to get the bartender to help me find a nice belgian from the menu and even she had some trouble reading down the list  so maybe some larger type as well
we had to ask that be removed from the bill
first time here was recommended by my coworker
the hash browns were soggy the coffee cost 3 dollars and wasnt even good and the bloody mary was completely bland and cost as much as a meal
use your yelp app and u get 10 off your food bill
the worker would teach you the basic buttons but there are a lot of other ones
asked for medium and got well done with a crispy burger
we used a groupon for this place last night and hate to say we were a bit disappointed
ive been there twice now and have enjoyed it both times  once on a first date great first date spot
to say this is reminiscent of the old produce section of phoenix is like saying david duke rally is a perfect representation of the apollo club
we were in disbelief when it ended
she was on top of everything and we never had to wait for anything
a memorable sight to see is the giant rubber duck statue located in the luxurious pool area
worth the investment
no acknowledgement of it being a special occasion
hes always accommodating
not bad not good no true complaints
from what i understand holiday inn will  at some point  take over the hotel but leave the hooters restaurant
we opted for two different entres so we could explore a bit
the food is simply amazing
great show venue with solid acoustics
it was also very thick but it was cooked more appropriately
the service is good the chefs are funny and the food isnt bad
first of all this is the type of restaurant i could see myself conceptualizing so i was sold when i first was told about it
they have a self serve beer wall bar games both a dj and a band that played all kinds of music
delicious food quaint atmosphere and delicious food
they were fine
makes me wonder what would have happened if i didnt ask them for a receipt
il y avait des planches qui semblaient intressantes
the beer was cold
its like coming back home
and yes i shared
this place is off the beaten path for sure but definitely worth the risk
from the poutine which when ordered with mushroom gravy and an egg on top is as close as youll get to an order of this awesomeness in toronto
great wings so crispy and yummy
i was pleased with a spicy mix of cheeses meat and vegetables that dazzled my palate which was happily followed up by two delicious cuban mojitos
the atmosphere of the restaurant has a modern casual feel with great decor
da bemerkte man eine karte unter der treppe zum unterstellen
the tacos were dry and lacked any flavor
you cant beat the pulled pork and the great selection of beer
looking forward to returning many times
the bruschetta is beyond belief good
the green chile hummus was also good
we had been shopping across the street at last chance
great patio too
the apple martini was blah too
the black pepper shrimp was yummy as well as the black raspberry cosmo
i went to the house at secret garden last night with a friend for my birthday
i wont be going back
the burger was mediocre and i believe that most places cook their burgers medium
i would recommend coming here for a late drink or a quick get together before going to another restaurant
hoops  hops march madness weekend
our host showed us which items should come out quickly and rather than making empty promises  our server and then the kitchen ensured we ordered and had our food in less than 15 minutes
after an hour waiting for our food they brought it out
as for the actual food it was a bit of a let down
doug and his team were extremely accommodating and quick to answer any questions i had in preparing for our event
the food was really delicious
gomaae yelpers posting should at least post how many spinach balls there would be in each order
the reuben i had was pretty damn gooda little small but still very good
it was really really good
the veggie burger was moist and tasty
i had the carnitas salad which consisted of romaine lettuce pickled onions carnitas and some awful pork rind thingies
she then goes on to tell me that their system wont get the order until 640 um wtf
the owner introduced himself as turbanator
my buddies were pleased as well  they both had burgers and were simply too happy eating to provide additional comments except for mmmmmmmm and happy smiles
if youre entertaining visitors or just want to splurge brand is nice night out
i love ghillie dhu
heres a thoughtif someone is unfamiliar with your particular wine list ask them questions about what type of wines they enjoy
we were already super buzzed before heading out to hard rock
loved the atmosphere the bikers really added to it
overall i was pleased with our entire dining experience
for dinner i ordered an appetizer version of the fried lobster tail but found it lacked flavor and was a bit rubbery
definitely a good time in that sense
i guess the beans were okay
if you really dont like it dont buy it
that dressing is amazing
for those who immediately get irritated by just looking at the crowded dance floor just walk over to a bar and ask them for a shot or two
boyfriend said burger was ok and his healthy side of berries were yummy
i saw slices of meat with nearly a quarterinch of pepper on the rim
called the next day and a female staff said yes she found it and even commented on how nice it was
if youre there on friday or saturday youre going to wait in line
also be careful theres a toothpick in the dates that my server failed to tell me so although i did bite into it luckily i wasnt punctured
the dressing was not the best pair either chili lime vinaigrette
this bar provides a nice setting to hang out and have a few drinks with some of the most individual quirky unique and innately beautiful brothers and sisters in the burgh
tiny and fantastic and worth a visit
the customer servicenot so much
that isolates one area of tables such that they cannot see the dj or dance floor
i was attending a convention at the nearby las vegas convention center and my group decided to stay at the brand new sls hotel
not worth it
of course those menu filler style choices are going to be sysco or us food brand or quality because for some odd reason people do order them so it may help the restaurant by having them as an option
the burger was good except it was a little dry
o a couple of miscellaneous sparks a good selection of glutenfree vegan and vegetarian items are called out on the menu
i had to check out a rumor which is why i chose this place
the hub is amazing
would i recommend this place to a friend
with very limited space inside you could barely move from your spot while listening to the artist
we are looking forward to come back
my wife and i wanted to stop by for happy hour because we liked the former central bistro
1 its bigger than its counterpart chada thai  wine and a little more casual  2 service is friendly and efficient 3 its in the same mall as the golden tiki and is super easy to find 4 the food is delicious
the food was mediocre and greasy
though the menu is heavy on comfort food meatloaf pierogies crab cakes the food is definitely closer to fine dining than bar food
the simplicity of the few seasonings were light and sensitively used but exactly how a piece of real quality meat should be treatedseasoned
i probably should have ordered a cocktail instead
we came here from la that has arguably has the best thai in the country
drinks were weak and expensive
however this is not ruths
no that sht is not
trust me if not checked out district one you need too
thicksliced but not soggy or underover done
beers on draft and luxe cheeses in their fondue but much of that goes wasted on the douchey guys drinking heineken in bottles and the skanky girls in skimpy outfits whore on air diets
both kids had a side of strawberries a large bowl in you
patio decor is nice
to top it off she asked whether the bill will be together or separate and was absolutely fine with splitting the bill for 16 people which i find to be rare in toronto
first they got my order wrong then gave me attitude for it
come for brunch one day dinner another
definite have to try  oh and the samosas are lentil filled delightful treats  slightly spicy
really suggest the duck carbonara
the food was good dont get me wrong but portions were exceedingly small in spite of the fact that our waiter claimed that all the entrees could be shared
quelites tacos i love me some braised greens
visit 1 i go with a handful of girlfriends
not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as i like it
the chicken was thinly pounded and the size of my face
again it was unpleasantly salty as were the fries
when you try 200 of their beers you get your name on the wall and you can move up all the way to 1000 crzy right
ive had good and ok experiences in this restaurant
this is a club for teens and young adults like really young adults
walked in very pleasantly surprised to see a ton of open tables
if youre visiting downtown lv make sure you stop by here
2 why would you be so carefree to not compassionately care about your food your staff your service
the ambiance is fun and laid back and its an infamous joint
great indian food  great atmosphere and great service
a great dining experience for a romantic dinner for two or for greater parties celebrating milestones
orgy in the pool later and plenty of people upstairs around 12ish so their was a weight for the couples only room but no problem cause people just hung out on couches and played
holy clogged intestine batman
i went to college in portland oregon and live near hawthorne and 39th where hipsters run the streets like rats in a mumbai sewage ditch
if you go to a wing place you should order wings
here is the bad i called lolitas and the phone rings and rings and rings and rings the lady who answered said she is not a person who can take reservations
utterly disgusted with the poor service at this place
the view and ambiance was great
my friend ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which had a mushroom sauce sundried tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes
but we were starving and the limited options on the buffet seemed like a reasonable tradeoff for instant gratification
it has a real natural feel to it
so a lot of flavors here that took me a few bites to get used to
the servers too were all very warm and personable
i can say the beer was good once it was cold
then they have their tricky ticket system 5 get you 10 tickets 20 gets you 40 so theres no benefit to buying bulk
marcus busserhost was extremely rude to us right off the bat
it was extremely disappointing that we wasted our time for nothing and the waitress did not take ownership in the situation
the best part of the meal was the lemon meringue pie
the staff was really friendly and knowledgable about their menu
as for the drinks they have a great selection of wines drinks and even nonalcoholic stuff
we are from youngstown and my girlfriend and i wanted to get away for the weekend
everything was priced well
refried beans tasted like they were taken from a can
what we did have was noise
it wasnt a heavy brunch but i left satisfied
anything at the wynn but you gotta deliver a premium product
the food is what it is
basically a good selection of beer nice tasty food if a little on the expensive side
their freshly made chipssalsabean dip is the first awesome platform to begin the meal
we ordered tea to drink
poor management poor logistics and average venue
however i would opt for another place when i visit again
they either use fish fillets not fresh enough or choose a type of fish that is not meaty and make the fillet too small so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments
all in all the staff didnt have to be as great as they were really could have just sent us on our way and i was expecting okay at best bar food
i must said that i order some water that tasted like chlorine
well dont really because they are awesome
this club also cant pull the same quality dj roster that edm fans practically go to clubs fori feel this place is marketed to people who hate hakkasan and omnia yet this just wasnt for me
after picking up a to go order my car decided to not start
the pasta is always reliable as are the sandwiches and small plates
man with an apron
i only wished the staff had been a bit more attentive  i discreetly asked for the cheque when my friend got up to use the restroom and the server seemed more concerned with her coworkers at the bar than processing my payment
the service was very nice
very good and probably different from what youve had in the past
while waiting for my boyfriend to finish in the bathroom one of the men in a security shirt flashed his light in my face and  yelled at me that i couldnt stand there
windy is a sweet waitress from minnesota who made it an enjoyable time
my girlfriend and i werent planning on seeing any shows due to a lack of interest but when we got to our hotel we leafed through some of the magazines there and noticed that brad garrett was going to be in town playing at his comedy club and thought that it would probably be worthwhile
i should have ordered a full serving of this
recommendations fish n chips baked oysters it is an oyster house after all beer specials  their burgers and fries are very very good
i opted for the roast beef dip with salad
so guess my wife and i wont be trying those new spaghetti dishes unless we drive to a farther olive garden because we wont be eating here ever again
the steak was smaller than the baked potato that came with it
they have a few arcadelike games such as shuffleboard pool darts etc
the inside looks like a limo party bus appropriate for vegas
priced great for large dishes
excellent rich in flavor but tastes very light
the only nightclub in vegas that plays hiphop old school hiphop rap new and old all the best dance music mixes mostly everyone enjoys
dessert chocolate delice  this was more of a block of chocolate ganache with a piece of peanut brittle on top
maybe because i couldnt see that well in the dark or because i was sleepy i didnt realize my soup came with a grilled cheese sandwich
my boyfriend had a tequila cocktail that was to die for while i found that the rasberry mojito left something to be desired
this review is based solely on the wings and cold beer not the shady crowd at the bar or the atmosphere
lyrics  neil diamond  the art of love she said its time to try out artizen she said were gonna eat brunch at artizen a place you never yelped a place that lives somewhere inside the camby i know im on a eating journey i wont forget i know i had to to wear a bow and yet i always could before i had to if i wanted to be bobites happy national botie day everydayi wish
food was delicious
i could have gotten this burger at tgi fridays and it would have been 5 cheaper
our security door  courtyard gate was just installed by first impressions
im handicapped and asked for table that was easy to get to the girl i spoke to assured me it wasnt a problem i had assumed that she noted that in our reservation
hung out in their tented area which is kinda nice
best one was probably the fish tacos but everyone i know seems to let me know that the scottsdale location is much better
it comes with a fried pork rind chicharrn in the middle
the rooms are nothing special and the hallways have a funky fried food smell to them but you can pick up a room for around 25 a night during the weeknights off season
about this time my friend noted that her sandwich was incredibly dry  so much so that the crust on the bread was almost sharp and causing a scratching sensation when eating
the gniocchi had perfect texture and was served in a delicious tomato based sauce with wilted greens spinach
day clubs should be outside of course with a lot of open space
till next time
the guys next to us actually asked what it was the flight is a great deal at 10 and comes with a ridiculous number of beers
la sala was a disappointment tonight we went to order drinks and even though they call themselves a tequila bar theres no speciality margaritas or even a tequila list
i have eaten in steakhouses all over america and in my all time favorite city for steak florence italy which i suppose carnevino attempts to emulate
and ruined their service for the remaining customers
plays mostly top 40 along with older songs that are popular
excellent service this time from brian and i wish this place was in palm desert
was the meal expensive
i was slightly saddened by this my friends mahi burger seemed much better
i was so taken back by the attitude i actually forgot what i had decided on
i found the bar though and that makes things seem a little brighter
the closest subway is villa maria  cross the street and walk straight on down
i really love the look and vibe of this place dimly light and for the most part a very mellow hang but i hate that they allow people to smoke in here
first off pretty good atmosphere the place was hopping and we had to wait a few minutes to get an open table
make reservations if youre going on a typically busy night frisat
i came here one sunday after a gig with some friends and because it was early it was quiet
except one tried to change the price of a skyy cocktail for me  charging me 11 bucks instead of 9 stupid bitch
i love it here
i cant even remember what it was but it was cooked perfect
these guys hang their hats on killer burgers terrific mac  cheese over 150 beers and some of the best tots this side of napolean dynamite
tldr  lots of great cocktails to choose from great tasting but a little overpriced food and very helpful service staff
so now we need this so called bartender to unlock a game so we can play we ask politely if we could use the tables and this motherfucker doesnt even have the nerve to turn his back around and answers the tables are broken when we just watched these other people just get off like wtf kind of service is that
i am a hotel guest and stayed here many times
we got a pizza and a microbrew and both were simply amazing
he then left to go put our order in
the atmosphere is what gets you
but my kids 4  8sat there hungry and waiting patiently
the mac and cheese was da bomb
they bring you bread you can choose from with amazing soft butter
i was surprised by my pleasant dinner experience on friday night
the french onion soup was a very generous portion
the clam chowder consisted of several clams in open shells and a little bit of liquid in the bottom of the plate with small pieces of vegetable
from beginning to end i had a phenomenal experience here
good food hearty portions and good customer service basically sum up my experiences at toms urban
composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast avocado bacon chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette the dinner sized southwest chicken cobb salad 1250 was almost big enough to share
the quadruple bypass burger awesome
ive been in madison for four days and weve been here twice so there must be something good about it
great atmospheregreat bar
thats when we learned it was 65 pretax per guy rather than 40
while it may have been a very adult mac  cheese there was nothing my inner child didnt enjoy about the dish
everyone i went with loved their meal
everyone in our group at their various tables were served their food at different times
we headed here for postdinner drinks and we were all kind of merry already
they had a nice menu and fairly reasonable prices
this made us confused as who our server is and who do we call to take our order for the next round of plates
this restaurants happy hour running from monfri 26pm features 5 martinis and bellinis plus 7 pizzas
the drinks or lack of knocked off a star for me
overall this is a great authentic mexican restaurant in the st lawrence area that will give nearby el catrin a run for their money
server didnt want to check if there was shrimp in my dish allergy and asked me to order something else
this is a true neighborhood pub its just a narrow room probably smaller than paris hiltons walkin closet but offers all the services and products that you could ask of your bar such as an electronic dart board juke box television a pinball machine a variety of sundries including cigarettes candy otc medications a great menu of pub grub and of course lots of booze
she was very friendly and attentive to our needs
this is the resturant that my boyfriend and i went to on our first date
4  45 stars
we came the friday after thanksgiving and i think management just didnt have enough people on staff
the pepperoni on the pizza were larger than normal and they covered the pizza we couldnt see any of the cheese because there were so many pepperoni
plus they charge a hefty cover
great atmosphere food music was the best part
the bar is always full of people during college football games
expect to spend an average of 100  150 per person including cocktails tip and tax
our food came out before we had even gotten our drinks
very violating and disgusting
its on the top 2 floors of the palms
we make it a point to come and get the kobe beef sashimi everytime we come to vegas
accidents happen so i dont hold that against jupiters but the fact that one person hadnt received their food yet when we were finished i do
loved the pizza  including the slight charring from the wood fired stove i think others have considered the lovely charring as burned
my friends and i have a cabana every sunday and we always have a blast
when i looked into the restaurant it looked barren oppressive and half the tables were empty
with todd english lending his name to the place i expected better
however emily at the front desk was extremely helpful and we received a partial refund due to the mold issue
more modern than bootys staff is more attentive than their next door competition
all you can drink
they have awesome happy hour specials  5 for the equivalent of 2 glasses of wine if thats your poison or a mini pitcher of beer which comes out to about 2 12 glasses of beer
my son chewed the ribs to the bone
and the guacamole was awesome because you can customize it since its table made its also a huge portion
the manager of this restaurant seriously just blamed us for talking to one another i dont know what you rest of you folks out there do at restaurants and not listening when our disinterested waitress supposedly explained things to us
so why not go ask before aggressively telling us no accommodations can be made
the food was a nice experience but our waiter was not as attentive as i would like with our drink orders and pace
my girlfriend had the red snapper and she loved it
will definitely be back
i had an ice cream for dessert which was amazing too
sound is alright but ive heard worse
this is the only way to really make the cocktail sing
yes i have a crush on him if you must know
i had made a reservation about a month before we were due to be in vegas for 630pm
always get the pandora love u long timeall star
in retrospect although we should have toned down our expectations we couldnt help but feel a bit disappointed when the waiter showed us the portions
this place misses the mark on the food and the other three things arent enough to compensate
i absolutely loved their food and the bar area the place to sit for ambiance is extremely warm and inviting
the amount your spending here its probably better you go out and buy your own karaoke machine and you will have a better time
i had always enjoyed my experience at tremont tap house until last friday
would definitely come back
i will definitely come back soon
first the view was amazing
the service has improved significantly since they first opened and brian is an awesome bartender who does a great job taking care of everyone
i gave flemings 3 stars because the 12 oz filet was seasoned and cooked well and also the manager came by to thank us for coming
next we had our entrees
the girls sang her their version of happy birthday and the food was well cooked and timed with the appetizers perfectly
makes a nice change from the usual run of the mill vodka bars that litter the streets of edinburgh
the caesar salad was alright but thats more because of my preference towards a creamy caesar not a vinegar one like they serve
i would give this restaurant 5 stars for their shakes
unless you type the value into the box but if youve had a few trying to type on an ipad is nearly impossible
dont bother with this place
but when customer is polite the least you can do is response
shortly later we had a regular waitress and she was very good
old movies that should have been on mystery science theater 3000
my detour to the bathroom revealed a  clean wellstocked john
it was highly inappropriate
when our bill came we were charged for 4 memberships even though we only signed 1 person up for a membership
the beans reminded me of my moms beans
i like these small desserts and now that pf changs does not have them anymore i may stop by at this place just for the desserts
the managers and staff were very friendly and helpful in having me set up everything
so great food but lousy service
all the dished looked great and had good flavor
this is a great place
the place is kind of dumpy which i dont mind
i say definite go as long as you are not easily offended by ethnic jokes and overt sexual content
the nachos did not measure up
vbgb is a beer garden or as close as it gets here in charlotte and a lot of us charlotteans are not familiar with the concept
chashu was just ok  outside of the restaurant parking is difficult to find
how this place stays in business is beyond me
we were given bracelets to get ini didnt know they did that in vegas
das essen ich selbst musste mein essen zurck gehen lassen und bekam auch kein neues mehr
everytthing we read said they have a great happy hour
the tvs are way too loud
ghost town it is not at least not on the weekends
then it took over 20 minutes for us to get water
no pancake option although you can buy them the adult plate version
walking in your nose gets invaded with cigarette smoke before you open the doors and get inside the dining room area
my boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich to which he added tomato and lettuce and honestly this might be the best breakfast sandwich of all time
came here hearing good things but was disappointed
cant wait to go back
the peach bellini was 14 and tasted good the kababaq with beef was 15 and it was good although the beef was quite tough to eat the crybaby curry with chicken was 13 very good and spicy and lastly we had the watermelon freeze hookah for 20 and added a vanilla alcohol flavored base for 10
that was odd
staff friendly enough
i came here for the first time in 3 years for my birthday supper only to be horribly disappointed by the quality and the manager oscar
we both had the ribeye as this is our favorite cut of steak
looking forward to our next meetup
id much rather be here than the mgm grand garden arena
the kitchen really shines and executes at a high level everyday
i bought my full setup here
she went to figure it out and came back with a computer error explanation
a bit of a walk from where we were earlier in the evening but eyecandy was a fun night out
go for the drinks
just no longer willing to put up with the noise the intense crowding the crazy parking thescene
the only thing i didnt like is that there is absolutely no cell phone service   the room was spacious and had tables closer to the stage
thats too much cover for what happened when i went inside
she went to a supervisor who didnt know where our seats were either
the one thing i liked about this guy is that no matter how busy he was he was downtoearth made us feel that he was paying attention and truely wanted to take care of us
we should have left then
perhaps one day ill have another chance to dine here and ill be able to gain a new impression
after drinks in the fabulouslyappointed study we went onto dinner in the dining room
anyway back to the burger  its a super great flavor profile but the texture is largely just soft
the food is always good
its worth it even if youre sick the whole rest of the day
its too loud you cant even hear the people sitting at the table talk unless theyre in your ear this is not a club or lounge
the beers are great
for food we got a few things to share zuke maguro special menu item unagi bibimbap tebasaki salmon tataki and hojicha pudding
after this there were three petits of smoked salmon foie gras and mushroom streudel
i also tried the pork belly pastrami which was also very tasty and moist
fun expensive indulgent when in vegas blow your hard earned gambling money at a trendy restaurant with dim lighting and blue cheese glazed bread
it was a huge fruity sweet dry ice steamin concoction that made my birthday
but seriously the service was outstanding
the tasting menu was definitely a good value and the food was near perfect
lage  in der nhe des hans im glckbrunnen in einer wie ich finde sehr schnen lebendigen und gemtlichen ecke stuttgarts
however feeling out of place was all in my head because the waitstaff was awesome
my friend ordered food and i swear i couldve heated up a hot dog fries and nachos in my kitchen faster than they did in the kitchen
and exceptionally small for 1200tax
theyre a cool local band called safety orange check em out sometime if you get a chance
the other day my friend and i went here for dinner as we were seeing a movie at the cineplex right after
also i just happened to be there at the same time they received their sanitation rating
i highly recommend it
what a shame  mill location so much better managed
we had 19 dishes and the chef is preparing everything right in front of you
i liked the pork chops but the meat was a little dry on one end
everytime i have been here it has been good times
and that was after i notified the manager
after so many years coming here its a shame that we are now looking for a new after game hang out
bolognese  smokey flavorful meat sauce over perfectly cooked pasta
food was crappy bar food id stay away from it unless you are really hungry
cant wait to try the divorced poached eggs
it doesnt taste particularly better than any food youd get at any other pub
we loved this bar
pulled pork tasted like it was finely shredded last week and warm up to a nice dry tasteless texture
he was also very knowledgeable of the history of the restaurant
perfect a dinner for two or a family affair
local to az but still like to go to this bar inside the hyatt and feel like im on vacation
the outside tables very comfortable and and allowed for some nice people watching
im not a huge night club person i kinda gave that up a while back but kinda had no choice since it was my friends bachelorette party weekend haha  my very first table service experience at vegas
large restaurant with a view of the lake plenty of indoor seating outdoor seating and a separate bar area
i really wish that they would put this on the menu i definitely would have just shared my own burger with the kid if i had realized
any and every kind of sports event will be on one of  their 8 billion tvs
melts in your mouth
the prices are average
my group ordered some and i was able to sample a few and in conclusion they were really good with all the flavors balancing out with each other and also jjanga probably makes the best salmon skin hand roll in town
have been coming here from 2007  their desserts are amazing also the main dishes are pretty good
ist ja auch nicht viel platz vorhanden um dort etwas zu gestalten
i had an alright time when i came but i wouldnt go back
they have poutine on the weekends generous helpings of the stuff
terrible customer service
its not a place we would return to if we stayed up in the north end of the strip
nice chill vibe with great food
heavenly  not a missed step all evening perhaps they couldve upsold me another glass of forge mill rose light and frivolous was the description  indeed
i ordered food tonight and after being told it would be an hour and a half wait for delivery my boyfriend and i decided to pick it up
not to say its a big list but at least they have rickards red
the salted marshmallow  and caramel
the neighborhood is kind of seedy but the food will keep you coming back for more
salad was very fresh
must have gotten a bad bartender or server but dont let that steer you away from this amazing place
as for the white castle slidersmove on
some of the beer selection is indeed 2 bucks as are a few of the apps
we ordered craft brews on tap me an ipa that was not too hoppy but hoppy enough if you are goldilocks of ipa
the sandwich was a sloppy mess that was so soaked with cooking oil that the bottom bun was soggy and the filling was just slop
not only are the displays fantastic but rent the headphones to get the full effect as you near each display you can hear the musical instruments being played
very slow service
the two of us came in at 8 sat night
then had a delicious chicken parm with a small accoutrement of vegetables escarole and potatoes
given it is a 360 stage and it rotates there is really no bad seat in the theater
our room was nice we got a horrible view   over all it was nice and if you have the money go crazy as for me i prefer a more humble hotel
she recommended the grilled wings which also were very good and i recommend
dessert of choice hands down
we then ordered a second drink during dinner and it came out after dinner wtf
waitress must have been having too much fun with her work friends
three more hersheys chocolate caramel martini
dish choices were clams and pastared sauce and chicken marsala
we also placed an order for bananas foster
egg white skillet only offered 2 choices and of course the protein options were extra
a 9 margarita made with patron silver i believe doesnt really seem like a happy hour steal but still a very well crafted margarita
and believe it or not i didnt have the appetite to try any of their awardwinning tacos
the interior has cool dcor and lighting
my friends ordered the burger which comes in two sizes 9oz and 7oz i think
they come out fast so you can nibble while you wait for your drink
im going to say that fez was more of a threeandahalf star experience but deserves to be rounded up to four
after that one i knew i had to ask for something stronger if i wanted to keep dancing that is so i got a double vodka and cranberry 24 which was much better but way too expensive
have been here a few football sundays
im glad we got seated when we did as it the place was packed i guess a play had let out when we left and i could see that they were a bit short on staff to accommodate everyone
the cheese looked like velveeta and the chicken looked scary
trying to mix it with the salad dressing didnt save it so we just picked around it
i had the ribeye hubby had the nystrip
what can i say about the traveler that hasnt been said
definitely have to try something new when i go back next time
food average but customer service makes it worth it
will return again
it has an interesting menu very flexible and understanding service good wine list and is a pleasant space
i didnt think id like it because i always walked passed it thinking its more of a drinking pub kind of a place
good variety of beers and ales and a fantastic environment to eat drink or just watch some sports
she managed to keep my beer full and did separate checks for a crowd of 30ish that was constantly shifting around
any place that smokes their own meats is worth a try
the clean glass case wine rack display and the display of lupicia tea tins were very cool id love to have actually try their tasting menu but i was on the run back to my hotel and had to grab my dessert to go after eating at monta ramen that plaza is full of good eats places
kreativ gekocht mit frischen krutern
i give cooperstown a five star  based on their pricing alone
the sauce was rich and tangy and after we raved about it our server brought us a serving of bread to sop up the rest
course is in great condition fairways and greens are perfect
pasta war auch ganz ok
in the bar is lively and loud in some of the other spaces quieter
we both opted for the combo  a skewer of bbq shrimp 14 grilled chicken and a couple strips of tri tip
i thought the sampler was excellent except the nachos which were just ok in my book
when i heard they were reopening another location at fashion show i had to come and see it
will be back
the security staff are not afraid to eject anyone who gets out of hand or causes trouble which is good
i knew it was going to be bad just remembering how terrible it looked from vip but when you have guests visiting you have to let them choose
the atmosphere inside is very art deco and modernreally cool and the best part is the outside patio off detroit with about 4 large picnic tables
dont go here i wish i had the name of the waitress however she never gave us her name
i went down the street to la frontera and got real tacos
wait staff is horrible here
we sat at the bar to have some drinks
mind you scallops are a normal menu item
10 came on a plate
we decided to sit in the bar area so we could eat sooner
as you can imagine neither of these explanations make any sense and illustrate a complete lack of logic in your staff and an embarrassment to the donovans brand
busy restaurantpub style place that is close to accunion etc and gets very busy when there are games
i wont be going back
we anticipated a wait for a table but when we got there we had to wait a good 5 minutes to get our name in
i thanked him profusely when he returned to pick us up
the three dishes plus three coffees came to about 75 bucks which is a little steep for breakfast food
he wasnt even ironically funny or accidentally funny he was just bad
fun atmosphere easy to hang out there
its the most delicious part
very mild and its supposed to be all natural
we also go the candy bacon as an appetizer
the problem was that he sandwiches were made on texas toast so there was just too much darn bread to properly eat the thing
would i recommend this show
chris ordered the lamb stew
rich smokey bacony goodness i could have eaten another order but didnt want to spoil dinner
theyre all hustlerscant even walk in before i get the would you like me to rub my tits all over your face line
its a bit pricey and the chefs table brunch was not too impressive
probanly i never tried fried duck before plus the sauce is very addicting
id definitely try this place again id like to try out their brunch offerings
you cant beat their 247 prices and friendly service
the good great location food and atmosphere
the vegetarian sandwich was unlike any vegetarian sandwich id had before
birkdale location keeps it front  center and busy
the drinks decent selection of craft beer and really decent cocktails
our most favorite visits have actually been sitting at the bar
you will need to get reservations at least a week in advance cause this place is sooooo popular and tiny as well
nice people the right size of portions
the best time we had in all of vegas
this is not my go to place
its a very cozy atmosphere and the food was amazing
i wanted to come here because i always heard great things about this place but it was a terrible experience and i truly regret it
i wouldnt mind returning here again in the future
this would be a good place to give your kids a few dollars and let them hang out while the adults talk
def enough for two people
party of 9 730 reservation
good bartenders trying their best to keep up with the crowd
i wont be returning
help yourself to a monet
i really wanted to like this place
food was excellent
and kept speaking on subjecti got to my limit then asked her for tabwife refused to leave to make a point
if you havent been here i would say find a reason to go asap
stopping briefly at the entrance to the courtyard ringed by brick and wrought iron he harvested a few flowers that sat in a carefully tended planter their yellow petals shone even in the shadows
it took ten minutes before anyone noticed that no server was taking our table during which time our soontobe waitress gave a great big bear hug to wait for it someone that she knew
had the charcuterie board wings never had wings with this taste very tasty and barrata barrata where have you been all my life for appetisers
not worth your time
everything on the food menu is 495 and i find the quality suits the price so dont come here expecting gourmet cuisine
i highly recommend this place
never been in this place when there were more than 8 customers and only one person waiting on everyone
well i stopped in here after taking my sons to the movie theater near by
our fault we should have opted to wait
the chicken fingers were extremely dry hard and crunchy like they had been sitting out for days or over cooked
great for sporting events even go alone and meet new friends
the vegetables were terrible i thought they had been soaked in vinegar  awful
phew now that i got that important information out there i can tell you that it was a delightful lunch
i had the opp to go back to firebirds and i must say they have redeemed themselves in my eyes
i hope that doesnt change  because the dish prices range are extremely affordable ranging from 618 most dishes averaging in 812
there is also an outside area that will be very nice as the weather cools off this fall
the waitress was welcoming but when she advised us there was a wait on tables place was packed i pointed out to her a small table by the window
they used a variety of potato that gave their fries a nice chewiness rather than the usual starchy kind
if youre a music love and a music junkie like me this place you have to go see
like i said this isnt really our thing but if our experience was always like this it could be
i would never go back there
such a good restaurant with so many menu options
the flavor on this as well was somewhat lacking
i mean i get it you guys are busy and have a nice view but seriously
they make you feel welcome and the vibe is very friendly
finally the tongue brioche
especially when youre drinking
perhaps they shouldve diverted more thought to the menu for nonmeat eaters and apparently the kitchen size
overall this burger was good as well it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas of the burger
wtf seriously  terrible place terrible employees attitude  i will never waste my money there again thank you chada street for ruining my friday night dinner
food wasnt mind blowing burger was kinda dry but ill take it for the price
service is just so so and food is very generic unthaw and serve
the atmosphere is also amazing
she immediately responded oh yah
the food i ordered korean tacos looked great when they arrived
i went with a large group and we ordered at least 20 trays of food
but it didnt wow me
when the intermission happened some guy came on stage and tried telling some jokes
the bun holds up really nicely to the size and greasy drip of fatoh i want another one now man
i went back again to the location on camelback and my burger was raw again
prices high for the quality of food
pro good location nice outdoor patio great happy hour  stick to cheap beer and maki con everything other than the maki is pretty lame classic rock 247
i loved sitting on the couch rather than a hard woodback chair that you often find in barsrestaurants
i had the steakhouse burger and fries and i couldnt stop eating them
the salsa is not what it used to be and the food is getting more expensive with more fillers
i guess you cant go wrong with decent food at very decent prices
if you are getting take out on a friday or saturday one the main reasons is because you are avoiding crowds
i had to ask for mustard
we switched back and forth between the dance floor and the hockey arcade game for the night which was a blast
im pretty sure she simply forgot we were there
et le dancefloor est plein de jeunes trs beaux qui aiment danser
the mac n cheese topped with doritos was interesting but not worth a repeat eat
la santisima is a great option for legit mexican in phoenix
kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didnt try and fight each other
on a side note ive read other reviews about 9 where people have commented on the english language skills of the servers and i feel i need to say that yes at times the language is difficult to hear but all of the servers that we encountered all worked very well as a team and if they were unable to describe or fully communicate with us they immediately got someone else to help assist
the only thing they had available was hamburgers
went there tonight about 630  there werent a lot of people there
overall its a unique place to experience
overall i would definitely come again
the best comfort food
the restaurant itself is very cute and rustic loved the vibe
jack astors is like the everyday ontario restaurant
great food a wide variety of beers on tap and solid service
youre saying that a costume that isnt a superhero didnt qualify for the superhero contest
i would like to consider myself a relatively cool person however no matter how stylish i may feel that day p and l will always have the upper hand
i got the bruschetta which was amazing
the friends started screaming heyyyyy and the bartender screams back oh shittttt this bitch then idk what else they said but one of the girls goes well be back in 20 mins and the bartender goes no 17 im very horny
the guys  i am sure there are girls but we only had guys that day who work there are wicked laid back and fun and were very much aimed to please
not so good
most of the food was kind of cold by the time you got your plate to the table which made it a lot less enjoyable
all in all not a great experience but i still love the idea of this place and from what i hear they really support the cycling community and its a great meet up or postride spot for cycling groups
oh and  get the chicken with the cheesy mashed potatoes
ive been to other hookah places and youre never charged if you arent smoking
i had the pork tacos and mozzarella sticks at half price for happy hour
a great place for a casual meal
will never eat there again
and nigiri sushi
at this point the straw that broke the camels back was the fact that they didnt bother to cover our bill or take care of us apologized and give us a shot in a dirty glass with a fly in it
i was not amazed as everyone else was with this show
who doesnt like chocolate
brilliantly salty and hearty broth balanced by crunchy carrots cabbage and caring
so well go off to his show  weve done it a few times  and well eat dinner with him afterwards
knowledgeable staff check out rich when youre here
the place brands itself as an authentic latin tapas bar
all of the saucesrubs are great
i am still hungry
overall it a was a great experience the food was amazing
maybe i will try a steak next time
we went on a weekday for happy hour and enjoyed it
the treehouse may be a great place to go for drinks but we will never go back for brunch
theres also an area outside where tao beach is and it was beautiful though smaller than xs
the guacamole was so fresh i swear the avocado was still growing
the manager said there is no way the employee said those things and that he is too calm to act that way
the arial dancers were fantastic as well
overall it was great
each dish was elegantly plated the food on the plates were excellent in quality and taste
the outdoor patio is set up nicely with cornhole and live music
first off it definitely pays to have a connection or know somebody who can get you in with a table
we got the unlimited mimosasbloody mary deal which was well worth it
sauna steam lap pool gym robes slippers the lot
stayed here on business this past weekend and here are my thoughts  sketchy looking area of the strip
le thai is le bomb
i ordered the sunburst farms trout because quite simply i screw it up when trying to cook it at home
dunno about you but i cant have thai food without my sticky rice
nothing inventive about them and edible with a 3 star approval
was not disappointed the servers and the hosts were very professional
ive seen yelawolf and chiddy bang here
our mimosas never got below a half of a glass and they were very attentive and friendly
its by no means cheap but you could probably get away with 5060 a head and be satisfied
we had waived the server down to get her attention and asked if she could provide us with an update on our order
everything made from scratch at this place
there was a sign that said please wait to be seated so we waited
aok with potential
then our food came an hour after that
especially the miso sake glazed brussel sprouts
waited 20 minutes to have the waitress judy shows up with no menus
this is almost always our first stop of the night
the husband had the hatch chili burger and described it as awesome
we were very happy
we sat at the bar where a waitress came by to ask for our order we said we were just waiting for our table
the roasted chicken was very tender as well
i got both
not only is the presentation on point but the cleanliness is a huge plus
i wasnt sure what to expect but was impressed
our server apparently a manager of some sort referred to us as my man and mom which i thought was super unprofessional but i guess thats soul food
everyone crowds together especially as it gets later in the day and things go to hell
always have a good meal and cant complain
the waiter finally brings the check and we got fed up with waiting for him to come pick up the money we walked it up to the register at the front
the other key factors was the aoli and balsamic making this dish enjoyable as well as flavorful
that seemed a bit unprofessional tho the rest of the staff were very polite
it appears to me that the kitchen staff didnt show up
see the entire place packed with guys no dance floor and no room to order at the bar
we got the mezcla de tostones 11 a combo of all of the meats
lots of room and great humidor
my wife loved the goulash
the location is convenient and the pub has adrquate seating
the food was lukewarm and mediocre
their beers seem to be very hit or miss
the boy who was serving us was not helpful in the least
they are completely irresponsible with capacity
when your clan of immigrants decides they are going to circle me and make my night bad and claim you have familia that are cleveland cops as well and you will call them i laugh in your face and point out that i am with a group of cleveland cops after a fundraiser next door at the union hall dont push the subject
there were hairs in the bathtub long black hairs i am a redhead btw couch was covered in black spots there was no batteries in the tv remote half the bathroom lights did not work phone kept beeping til unplugged it so couldnt call down to guest services and complain about everything and since was almost 1am didnt want to go down and bitch as it was late and the kleenex box was dead empty
both numbers will place you on immediate hold after about the 12th ring on hold with terrible elevator music
kommt auf den kellner an und man muss sich halt durchsetzen
we were not impressed with the garlic and bread for 500 and would have been happy with the baguette bread plain  but they charged 200 for that
the owner is an asu alum
it wasnt bad
the rehab size is twice the size of the relapse for only 2 more but after seeing my meal im sure glad i stuck with the regular
you get a good amount of gelato for the price
did not enjoy the rogan gosth
misschien dat wat blauwe kaas erdoor zou werken maar goed
fish tasted fresh and servers were attentive
youll still get a good view from there
i heard about this place on a local radio station
inattentive but only after reading us the specials in what almost sounded like a parody of snottiness without letting either of us ask any questions about them
it was dicklicious and magical and everything and youd ever want from a male stripping experience
if you havent tried this place you need to get down there and try it out for yourself
its practically commonplace to be served breakfast food in generous portions  enough for two people per entre or so i thought
got a tokyo tea was pretty good
once the waitress took our drink order her service was fine
the worst nachos i have ever had
the food was excellenti had the chicken piccatawith angel hair pastaand do recommend it
our waiter didnt seem to know much about wine varietals
10 seemed a little high but its scottsdale so i guess thats pretty normal
i also wasnt a big fan of the 2 bands i saw while there
and as always the food was delicious
the variety of pizzas is great you wont be sorry you stopped by
the wait staff is extremely knowledgeable in their menu and their confidence in their preferences is much appreciated
so in summary i would never ever under any circumstance go here again
1st time here and it will not be the last
in other words its my kind of joint
the server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which i didnt even touch because i was soo annoyed
definitely better than the first time i went in the autumn
so prices were fair
they get the extra star for the quirky fun staff but the food is meh
whenever i decide to venture uptown i always want to go to ri ra
the owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable and groovy
i got a cesar salad and the meatball soup and my mom ordered the crab cakes
they invaded the djvip area so at least i had that experience
strike two no apology just a waitress that didnt deserve to be in front of people and a cook who didnt care
he loved it
we all had an amazing experience and will be returning
we all thought the food was good and priced decently for the atmosphere you get
the beef tartar was a very tasty version of this fine treat with the beef cut into little cubes about onequartet of an inch across
we did a fri and sat night package and even though friday was a fluke due to our own issues not theirs saturday surely made up fir it
the food is awesome but service is horrible
i wasnt particularly impressed by marquee
just watched ka last weekend and i would tell you to go and see a different cirque show
i thought he was going to turn out to be rude but after one of the steaks was overcooked we got treated like vips and it ended with a round of taste testing pastrys which made my boss very happy
this place is not a brewery but we had told them were were going to four peaks
it came out super fast they werent that busy that night and it was a large portion
very happy with my first experience here and will be coming back soon
i couldnt wait to order my favorite items on the menuwhich they still had wedge salad romaine lettuce maytag bleu cheese dressing bacon cherry tomatoes 8 12 oz filet 38 side of potatoes au gratin 7 the lettuce on the salad was nice and freshvery crisp and juicy just the way i like it
i grew up in savannah and this is nothing on the soul food meternothing
i love the window view great customer service thats always a plus and delicious food
i was let down by the salad bar
we eat out a lot and usually it comes to 50 or 60 bucks at places like that
our waiter rene was qualified to work at any of the top restaurants on the strip
even though it was strong it was still smooth
we went back twice for over 7000 we got sugar water
the best thing ive had here was the sauerkraut balls
was not impressed at all with the food or service
better to leave full than hungry for certain but in retrospect my husband should have ordered one of the 3 course meals and we should have asked to share the pot pie and i should have just ordered an appetizer dessert and small side salad
we spoke with the manager and told her that the food was terrible and we were leaving
at least then i get something for my money
we had dinner which was unbelievable and our waiter recommended we check out the club
i feel like a poor person excluded from a place designed for folks with more disposable income
there were several bar seats available
the lil pink bus made the experience epic
i was really excited to eat at a restaurant that was open past 11 pm but was instantly disappointed when it took the waitress 15 min to come to our table
we went this last time for happy hour there was 4 of us
someone should tell the chef that the silverskin the sllimy shiny thin skin on a piece of beef should be removed
i did not drink any alcohol on this trip
food was not good
love this place
he even came to find me in line to make sure i was taken care of
i hope they make a better effort in the future with their customer service
quiet on the night i came
clearly they were understaffed but we felt that the whole place did not live up to any of these suspicious yelp reviews it also looks nicer in the pictures than it really is pretty cheaply decorated
no thanks casbah
the only minus was the southern american people on the street who asked you for stripclubs and bars
its like milf haven up here
this place was recommended as a good date night spot
when we arrived no one greeted us so we kind of just stood there
they have kobe
free wifi is available throughout
i would not return although family style is nice the price was rediculous for the quality of the food
the pad thai was great
i enjoyed my ales and our bartender was very helpful with recommendations and samples
baseline sports bar well its a nice bar with a huge screen to view sports and events
madison our server was very attentive throughout the whole night
a simple salad followed by a main course of a veal chop and dessert with berries and whipped cream
i hate coleslaw but the place kills it with the apple slaw its so good
had lunch here after hearing from a few people that the place was so delicious and amazing so i decided to have a bite one day and i ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich for pickup on my lunch break i got back to work and the only thing i could smell from my bag was pickles i had no idea why since i ordered a hot sandwich and fries
it had your typical spicy mayo dressing which was not exciting
one of the tastier bread baskets ive had
we got the food carryout for lunch at the office and it was still nice and hot when we got back
but tolerables not fair
i took a few bites and immediately figured it out
finally the food isnt what we came here for it was the beer
the restaurants are really good
the tapas plate had some kind of taquillo some eggplant pita triangles baked brie and a dish of tzatziki sauce in the center of the plate
was it worth it
the third disappointment came from the continuously declining service
second the staff
the chicken wings were surprisingly tender
it was great and well worth it
the fried wontons used to dip with were great
the cornbread wasnt my favorite but overall a cool atmosphere and quality food
in the bar
reasonable prices as well
we just go by ourselves now but hey  at least the food makes up for the service
by far the best dessert ive ever had in my life
les luminaires les bars la dco mais cest beaucoup plus jeune que ce  quoi je mattendais et vraiment bond de monde les soirs de fin de semaine juste pour dire lattente de la file slevait  45 minutes
overall a great lunch  date place
we had concert tickets for 8 but 20 minute delay should not be a problem
i eat burgers and pizza every week so im considered a professional
i finally went up to them and told them and all they did was say okay and we had to wait to be seated
trying some new pizza place
much better atmosphere and scene
very good food and even better service
the service was fantastic the drinks were unique mint mojito shooters if my memory serves me correctly and the atmosphere was fantastic
i never got an apology
the atmosphere was nice but the service and food were lacking
this was beyond repulsive and if they employ this caliber of people they are not worth frequenting
so everything would have been great if we could have seen him
i also ordered the sweet potato fries with a maple mayobest cooked fries ever and the maple mayo was so good
there were tons of single hott men that loved to buy us drinks all night so ladies this is the place to be
i have been here many times
it wasnt pleasant to cut and put into our mouths
we visited east end yesterday
they wee room temperature and tasted like plastic
ever been to a thai place with a sommelier
i finally got to try the food at this place
then came the burgers and steak fries
as you walk around you will also encounter showgirls cowboys nuns with their boobs out and all sorts of other weird things
started off with the pretzels which are more like pretzel bites
assuming the worst we ask the bartender whether their kitchen is open
after i was walked out of the back door by the bouncer i spoke to two security guards outside the hotel in the parking lot and explained to them what happened
aged meat is what this place is a all about
you had your selection of bbws and the petite ladies
the staff is awesome and the people interesting to look at
the burgers are amazing and the coleslaw is fantastic
they werent wrong
the wings are good and give you a rough time
the oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it the flavors just kindapop
bbq pork grilled cheese was really tasty and good
i order the schnitzel platter which came out a bit underdone but this was due to the thickness of the pork
we went in and they had the 20 per person which bought you two drinks which isnt a bad deal so no biggie
oh youre thinking about going somewhere else for a drink tonight
place is definitely a dive which i am a big fan of
love this place
the owner now knows my faceslightly embarrassing but its a great place to go and chill to get some good grub
not even like it was 658 it was 655 disappointed
die kinder knnten ins gebsch entwischen und die automatische sprinkleranlage oder das grnzeug zerstren
our waitress brought over the wrong type of potatoes and we decided not to complain due to our frustration with the experience thus far
i actually had a bar tender serve me a margarita that was just tequila with mountain dew sprayed in it with a lemon
but 10 for 2 portions of great food is a good deal so why am i complaining
we are from a small colorado town and dont have anything like this
i went for lunch and i have also been at night
vous le comprenez ce restaurant est un home run troisime fois ici et toujours un grand fan seul bmol cest parfois un peu bruillant mais je recommande dominiom grandement
if visiting the janesville location order it in advance
i thought alright at least when he turns around he will be forced to acknowledge me nope he just kept on pretending like i wasnt there
both were excellent
finally after asking the manager to fix the error i paid 20 bucks extra in cash just to leave
if i lived in the area this might be a nice little place to toddle over to for a bite
we travel to las vegas once a year and always wind up eating here 23 times during our stay
the galette was delicious
the 165 marg
everything was delicious and the service was fantastic
the bar staff was incredible though
go if youre young and single looking for a great way to start the evening
at 7ish on a weeknight the bar stools were mostly taken a few tables had guests and there seemed to be some sort of event going on in their private room
as previously stated the salad was larger than expected and included chickpeas almonds and avocado dressing so it was pretty filling on its own
psh provided me with two fun evenings while in town and i will be back next time work brings me back
also that the event  is video recorded
ok back to crying in my room thinking about what could have been
i can imagine why because its so packed
when my husband doesnt even finish 12 of his meal you know its bad
i stuck moinette brune by the bottle
the guy gave us 2 options to keep the patio table he brought us to or cancel our reservation for a refund
this place is
im not a hard sell
food is excellent
i thought we were in vegas not salt lake city
i didt drink but my mate did
so i order
seems to be a recurring trend based on other reviews
ive only tried like 2 of the choices on the menu but who cares
lj and scott behind the bar are always on point and gracious
the long island ice tea cocktail was great too
they are building a real winery down there using quality grapes not from pa
despite our thursday night room temperature entree and food runner kid who has no idea what customer service means i assure you that the server and restaurant manager were on their a game
the drinks are strong
the goat cheese overwhelmed the entire thing i ended up wiping most of it off because to was all that i could taste
the beers were very mild
had a fabulous spectacular time with close friends new friendsgreat venue over all however the worst decision ive made that nightbesides planking in odd public placesarriving at xs night club for a social gathering of some sort long story short i valeted my whip motor vehicle at the wynn for xs night club ended up cabbing it to my hotel cosmoroom and i figured i pick up my car that same morningthese aholes put a door ding on my car what really made me furious was that i know the knuckle head jumped a curb an found a nick on my rim and my strut is screwedfqqddissapointment
a good beginning to a night out
better than average bar food plus entire meals
when the food arrived i was surprise with a piece of meat that was so small i was unable to classify the cut the server said it is a 4 ounce piece but i would hesitate to say it was more than 2 ounces
ate dinner with my mr c sunday night
man hat beim fleisch zwei spiesse zur auswahl hackfleischrind und scheibenfleischrind mit 50cent aufschlag das finde ich aber ok dann kostet der dner 4 statt 350 man wird aber auch satt davon und es schmeckt gut
my friend wanted italian so we headed back to lombardinos
the hotel over all is nice but leaves a lot to be desired
my husband ordered a burger rare which he loved hes picky about his burgers
it was a beautiful day today so we sat outside
in the end the food isnt bad but for a the 12 dollars the tiny dull salmon dish cost and the 9 decent pizza better tasting and equally unique madison flavors can be found
it was delicious great ambience and overall experience
oober salty very expensive slow service
this was it tucked inside the bellagio right on the casino floor there was this hip trendy place
so so outstanding
i sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service
it was quiet when i stepped in maybe because it was easter sunday but i liked that anyway
i found the drinks fairly priced for what they are complicated and strong but none of them would be a repeat for me if we go back ill try something else next time
anyway we left a 15 tip so she wont say the same about us to other future customers
i had the heirloom spinach salad and it was good
lots of potential just not following through
like how they do keep things local and incorporate other businesses
guess i cant complain too much its our own personal outdoor area
the food was delicious my husband enjoyed his bacon cheese burger and my salad was perfect
had fish tacos
nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare
i consider these menu items to be the best in madison
120 with tax and tip for two people
friendly landlord and locals an impressive range of guest ales and a decent beer garden to soak up the rays on a sunny day admittedly something as rare as a beer garden itself in scotland
he had his back to us and never acknowledged that he even heard us
give ourselves adequate time to check your baggage and move through security
le pied le paradis
our favorite pizza place
highly recommend the spinach dip and pretzel bread my husband gets a steak every time there because he lives that
awesome food great service kid friendly and cold drinks
my faves are the shoshito peppers a little plate of manchego and the tomato bread
dont forget to wear a tie
i feel terribly for all of the people waiting in line behind us and only hope that they did not experience what we did
food was delicious
i love the fuego group
its great because it reduces the need for waitstaff to deliver food when its cooked
over the years i attended conferences in lvs atlantic city london et cetera
making beer here is a great way to build a memory with friends and family
eh it was just okay
i got a burger sorry cant remember which one bc i had had 6 drinks at this point
overall the staff and owners at page one are very friendly and open to conversations if that is what you are looking for
however we ended up at a bar across the street called blonde and had a even better time there
the staff is all wonderful friendly and very helpful
i had the rare beef appetizer and the champagne risotto for my entree
the service made this dinner
the photographer did inform us he wasnt with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo but as far as the food its mostly breakfast options the portions are large and its relatively inexpensive
ive been to georgetown for happy hour and for dinner on the weekend
the thyme was a nice compliment
bouncers are so rude  pushed the ga like a trash
super dry and no flavor which is super disappointing because we live down the street and know kanye and kim kardashian west had gone but its all hype
so i can say that the quality is consistent
the worse customer service ever  i dont recommend this place for anything
this place is extremely over priced
i was really suprised with the service
i didnt expect them to be so big though so i coudlnt finish it and took one home lolz
the turkey burger falls apart easily and is sort of dry
the food was great but as far as value goes there are much better options out there
great venue in cleveland for music
they repaved the parking lot and i even heard they added new insulation to the roof of the building
i try to big optimistic about the epicenter but most businesses here are terrible
the only thing that was good was the wineand they didnt make it eek
they were super busy so the overall service wasnt that great but the food made up for it
next time i would skip the 2 bacon addition  i was hoping for some crispy style bacon for added crunch but it was disappointingly of a floppy and very fatty variety not to my taste
fantastic place for families and large parties
bangk has a passion that translates to guest experience the alchemical golden equation of the restaurant business and experience
its bigger than it looks with a second bar tucked over on the far side of the dance floor
our third course was  i think a cream of celery soup which was heavenly
though it is at a low volume im not a fan of the music
this is the only bar i can think of where i know the name of the bartender  jason
it was a pretty dead night in cleveland and not many people were out
i tipped gabe 20 and told him good luck
the chicken and shrimp skillet was literally cooking in front of my face
same waiters and chef
id definitely come back here even if its not for food its a nice atmosphere has good drinks and good service
i took a buddy of mine whos visiting for a drink last night
also had a great gin and tonic
again soul does not disappoint
the asparagus was cooked properly but the mashed potatoes could probably have used some cream in them not bad but im picky on simple sides like that
i dont have to see servers ducking in and out of my movie
after going over the menu i asked her opinion on some choices i had narrowed down
i wasnt there for the service though we wont be back
ive had far worse but i have had better
thats always been a little odd to me
it feels so cozy and romantic
on both visits we really enjoyed the service
shame on them
rolls where fake  weck rolls the roast beef was nothing but watery meat chicken fingers where nothing more than target bought strips and the sauce was nothing like true buffalo wing sauce and lets not go there with the fries
steaks cooked to perfection sides pretty good and ample for sharing
then we were seated and waited somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes to have a waitress welcome us even though i complained to the host after 10 minutes
almost felt like we were interrupting table was sticky floor was sticky just yuck
visiting during slow hours does not make it any less amazing
not the business i am in
in fact will and lynn are top tier and choosing hot bagel boys
a bar for grownups
pay double  and you will get better oh yeah
great place for a happy hour drink or impress your farmersonly date with a big city cocktail list
this concept is popular there and im pleased they are trying it here
i have to say at 9 for a 14 of corn and a spoon of slaw and potatoe salad accompanying a poorly cooked burger on a cheap ol bun is not worth itand kind of disappointing
this place is literally right across the street from the markham street exit at bathurst station
i would go back but just wish it were closer
when i pulled up i almost thought i was at the wrong place
all the people in there are so friendly and the staff provides one of the best services that i have seen even better than saphire and rhino
service was decent
the cheese was good but expensive and the asparagus were alright but cheap
at 18 a meal and so many good reviews i expected much more
to start i ordered a jalapeo beer
i actually googled pec after reviewing the wine list it seems to be the niagara equivalent of appellation controllee
the quality of the music varies wildly depending on whose shift it is
anyhow we ordered the jug of caipirinha which was refreshing but more like flavoured water than the real deal
for our entrees we had the bone in steak that was 24oz cooked perfectly at medium rareit was divine
stumbled upon this place after wandering around aria and city center on our first night in vegas and the pub
i dont think i could trust this bar if i was in the same foxhole with them
if i wanted to get screwed in vegas i could have hired someone to do it for a lot less money
ive been to volo a few times now and have never loved it quite as much as i want to
the only bad review this place has is from some douche named erik who was pissed that he didnt like what another guest was wearing and fortunately she isnt on the menu so dont let that influence your decision
but the reduction sauce was rich and salty that brought out the tender texture and juicyness of the meat
we started a wine tour here a few years back and the sommeliers know their stuff
good location if you want to be in the old area of las vegas and freemont square
fine we didnt want to make an issue of it and just wanted to get on with our evening
quick with drinks and always made sure to come by and offer another
i would describe it as cross between a hunting lodge and a 1920s speakeasy
we left half an hour into kaskades set
was it pricey
i am a regular
while im standing waiting longer
the balcony seats are superior to what youll find on the floor
this is a cirque de soleil and a bit pricey but i thought it was so well done that it was worth every penny
have never had a problem with service
the fish was tasteless as were whatever else was rolled up inside the tortilla
there wasnt even salt and pepper on the table in case you wanted to add more flavour
quirky little place where everything is for sale
i do not want to leave a place without being filled up
he left it on the table for us to refill our cups when needed and it was delicious
if i tried making this simple sandwich at home with ingredients from my local smiths disaster af when you use high quality ingredients and prep it perfectly you get next level stuff
the jamaica green curry vegetables was good and spicy i had it with shrimp but you can also get it as a vegetarian entree
and the rest is just as amazing
i guess its a bit slow at the start with everyone first arriving
the eggplant that was there was in thin slivers not the chunks im used to getting
good tomato sauce
everyone who served us was polite courteous and quick
in fact when it came time for brunch the next day we found ourselves right back at the bar at pbr
good englishstyle pub food
it was hands down my favourite casual dining spot on the strip
we had a shrimp and avacado on a tostada street tacos a pork dish and several drinks and the total was around 35the shrimp and avacado was my favorite
i hate you
the food was okay a bit on the saltier side
we went here hoping for good mediterranean food  evidently sushi is the way to go
we ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated
very overpriced sandwiches soft pretzels were not soft and it was hard to get service i was at the bar
and the bar is stocked with the usual range of beers wines whiskies and other spirits
he is a young guy
went there for their dinner and a party saturday nights
im pretty sure free wifi and fabby prices
great joint for out with friends on the way to the bar or i would think for happy hour but not for a family dinner my grandma had to barrow a flashlight from the waitress it was so dark
i think it was supposed to be akin to a crme brule with a torched crust but the torch was probably out of gas so the crust was missing
the actual club is pretty small with seating areas surrounding the dance floor
for any of you big lebowski fans out there february brings you the dude abides melt gigantic beef and pork meatballs fried mozzarella sticks topped with marinara and romano and provolone cheese
i try to shop eat local because i am a surprise resident
location really depends who you are
ive had more selection and better beer at bars
gets packed well well worth it
its all pretty darn good but we are in the age of asking so what
that kinda put us in a sour mood until we were invited to a table for free drinks
its really cool that they have very revealing windows that really show off the inside of the establishment   oh 300 east how you teased me when i looked at you while driving past
will definitely keep coming back to this neighborhood gem
so here we go servers and bartenders excellent they really really try hard
wait person never refilled my water
he ended up with 17 pickles on the side
thanks yelp and thanks olive garden
we are vegetarians and they added vegan fajitas to their menu
its big box yet recently brand refreshed
we ordered the chicken wings which were actually a bit spicy but they were amazing
why michael symon
went on a thursday night at 730pm and it was almost empty
where you transcend cute is with your menu though
great value and definitely appreciated the drink specials
yeah there are a bunch of hot chicks shakin their thing at least there were when we went but the same can be said for a lot of clubs in vegas
although it was a tuesday night this place was definitely questionable
i find myself deliberately trying to be obnoxious so that i can leave an impression which isnt necessarily a good thing  fighting with screaming infants never is
we ate our fill and felt like we got a great deal
ps im a hotel guest on top of it
management needs to get in gear and get this place back in order
for entrees my boyfriend and i got the lobster and shrimp angel hair pasta
our server elizabeth was great
waited about 15 minutes and got my pie in a white box to go
boyfriend had the streak which he proclaimed to be perfect
gorgeous and delicious the drinks are on point as well
i asked the waitress if they were homemade
we had a spinach salad which was the highlight of the meal
the worst nightclub ive ever been
compared to other clubs in vegas they would say this is in the top 3 too bad you cant go into the pool here like xs if you have a room key you can get in for free up to 2 people
so once they changed it up they lost us
they made sure to put on a show while making your drink and they served you quickly
i like that this is a nofrills pub
throughout the meal i tried to get some service but i guess the layout of the place makes it difficult for servers to see you so a bus boy had to refill our glasses and do most of the work
we sat behind the bar and it was somewhat loud but as expected
it was a very nice save to a night that was going downhill
and guess what she never brought it out
it was a saturday so as usual downtown was pretty busy with the avid club goers and such
the brownies were either old or a very bad food service product
decided to dine on the outside patio because it was a nice evening such a great choice
prices are good service is great food excellent
the 5courses that we had were inspired by her travels to the far east including vegetable pakora thai seafood green curry beef satay nasi goreng and forbidden rice pudding
ive been here for lunch twice
my husband and i were looking for brunch on a saturday at noon and all the popular brunch places in leslieville had long lineups so we decided to give braised a try
drink card on table does not post prices
the two of us had a dozen each they go down easy
after being told that they didnt have the ingredients to make a couple drinks i requested at the bar which btw were nothing super fancy or unusual for las vegas or any reputable big city bar the female bartender handed me their menu and said pick something off this
i definitely enjoyed my experience here and would recommend any tequila loversconnoisseurs to try this place at least once
i went here again last night with friends and it was even better than last time
for non musicians bartenders are super friendly
it was tasty
very disappointed in the service tho the guys who helped us was nice just no reason for us to wait so long at all
this place will always be the primary place to grab a guinness for me
get the black and green burger with oxtail fries
the food  we ordered our drinks first and little did i know that my friend was on a mission to find banana bread beer
we started our dinner with an amazing ceasar salad
however its not as grilled cheese as i expected
i think i might come back and try again but i am not going to lie the patio seating kind of turned me off
avoid at all costs
we told him about what had happened and said it was not going to be easy to resolve the issue for some odd reason
it is basically a club with a restaurant built inside it
drinks take a while but we had already consumed enough that it was okay for us
freaky fun environment  i kept expecting something to jump out and scare me
if i could have tried several more i would have they all looked so good
made the mistake to head over here leaving surrender to come here was a bad choice
where else can all your vices become reality in one place and its legal
i recently visited waypoint for brunch
definitely try the agave dragon ftw
silkys is my go to spot for a laidback friday night where you can have a few drinks and play some shuffle board without a crazy crowd
we went back outside and 15 minutes later went back in
it was 11am on a saturday and when i walked in i was hit with a smell of good food and noticed a lot of people eating
ive been here a few times and it had a laid back feelyou dont have to dress up in your clubbing geara simple shirt and tshirt look will do
this place is the bomb
the food was good
i continue to overwhelm him with an eating bunch and despite running our waiters ragged everybody was beyond pleased
all which were surprisingly good since the female lead vocalist had such a powerful voice
dont come here
they had everything from a ground ribeye burger to a shepherds pie to fish and chips to nice salads to grilled cheese
the truffled mashed potatoes are excellent  very rich
our waitress recommend the spicy chicken sandwich with stuffed tater tots
just arrived so far very good service  ah food arrived
so i called in an order to go
i really loved this place and i will be coming back for sure
when i went to complain upset of course i told the bartender you need to get a manger out here right now
they had themed dance nights for various niches
weve been really disappointed in the food quality service and now this
its going good
rehab is definitely a must
also they crumbled blue cheese over the dish
they also serve a eggroll shaped fried mashed potato side thats delicious
it was a saturday evening  they were a little busy
we ordered two pasta dishes and a few hours after eating it my family got severe food poisoning
i had one bar all night long so did my friend
wob is a kicked back bar that does honor its name with a pretty darn good selection of brew
noodles and cheese were indistinguishable mush
an awesome batter and fresh sweet onions that are not quite raw and now quite fully fried
i had their shroom burger
ive been here about 4 times and each time i had a bad experience
these were impressive considering this was a gimmickytype of restaurant
the oysters are huge but be prepared the last order wasnt cleaned thoroughly and stomach contents from the oyster came shooting out as you bit into it and or cut into them  if the rest of the meal wasnt perfect that would have ruined the meal but my group laughed it off and moved onto the next course
dont expect much from a dive bar
filed up quickly but had privacy with a tiny booth in the back
i like that they have the ability to videotape your swing and break it down to while you watch its cool to watch
most are fantastic
hoping the toasted rye bread would compliment the meat and somewhat pickup where it left off it didnt and just made the sandwich more difficult to handle literally
lets start with the muscles
try the rachael
heres a random sample of a few other dishes we tried    ebimayo  loved how big the prawns were too bad they didnt even hold a candle to gyoza king
the food menu was a good size with a good variety
and get a little tipsy during happy hourit sounds like a sweet deal
the manager jeff always stops by our table to make sure everything is perfect
i finally approach this asian girl turns out she was just a bit shy since she was new
it was good but a little much
schlechte planung sonntag nachmittags bei strahlendem herbstwetter ist vorherzusehen dass da viele kommen
the free chips and beans are always a nice way to start our meal as well
i got tortellini with a meat sauce
the bacon jam is amazing and even better if you top it with apple slaw
thank you for making our anniversary so wonderful
the waitress was personable and nothing took forever to get to us as some of the previous reviews stated
puts hooters to shame
and their king crab and avocado stack  holy yum
stop reading this and just go to parlor now
the servers glide about all in black smiling at the madding lunch crowd
never got anything the rest of the movie
calamari is often disappointing at other area restaurants because the seafood is subpar and it comes out greasy because the kitchen either doesnt know how or doesnt care to fry it right
the sportsbook in lagasses stadium is a joke
i thought draft beer choices were limited for an irish pub
a thin sturdy layer of crust and charred onion giving way to sweet wheatiness another layer of thin crunch sidling up to a ginormous ridiculous muffin topping buttersaturated smokey fungusy portabella cap
all together the 17 got me a real basic and not so filling meal than again i do usually eat a lot so maybe it might be filling for some
came out for lunch and a day of golf
speaking of the bar this is the real deal
if youre looking for a place to be entertained you cant go wrong with the multitude of options at the nc music factory
solid 3 stars
i was impressed with the white house
glanced over the menu
i couldnt photograph it due to the darkness of the front patio
my boyfriend couldnt help but to add the delicious salsas on them anyways however
will definitely come back
i think its cool dont get me wrong
all in all though one of the best places ive eaten in the area
the grilled entrees especially the salmon and steak are some of our favorites
the beer i had was delicious but for the good we received the prices were pretty unrealistic
the crowd here is definitely more hunkish than other gay bars which cater to other subsections of the gay community bears dykes leather etc
we liked the food a lot  the lobster enchiladas were phenomenal
also the service was not good
blasted in the face
i had to pull up their web site to get descriptions
its creamy salty and just the perfect consistency to dip that breadstick in and do work
excellent food deviled eggs and tacos drinks bloody mary and service
the folks at the thirsty lion have a reserved section for us that has multiple large flat screen tvs a buffet and bar as well
highly recommend stopping here if you like a good night life
furthermore the roof top pool was awesome
my kale salad with butternut squash was a delight  a well balanced salad dressed perfectly
if youre a gamer they offer 10 in play after playing 20 for joining the slot club
got the happy ending cocktail and it was delicious
i also came one time and almost got into a fight by catching this guys arm as it was about to smack one of my gfsand finallyi came and watched people making out a couple one redhead and some dude almost boinking her outside by the waterfall as her dress kept riding up and her white panties exposed to the public while on the other corner some guys got two asian girls worshiping him like some fallic symbol
still i cant subtract a star
they boast that theyre fries are one of the best in the nation but they are really just over salted fries and ive definitely had better
the food is amazing and the staff is  friendly
first time at this location
expecting better service especially after watching undercover boss
i dont know what the salad dressing is but i do not care for it
if the wait was shorter i would rate it 5 stars for sure
both guys got major heartburn yuck
they have food never tried it though
very professional and awesome food if you like indian give this place a try
wish i could give negative stars
he just kept talking to a friend that was visiting him at the bar
and it seems they went out of their way to hire lots of good looking cool and sexy staff
wow the place is huge pricey but set up is legit and clearly bowling and laser tag are taking new leaps for the west valley
dance area gets very crowdedbut for the most part everyone is pretty friendly
both dishes came with what id call medium spice level
what i remember the most from this visit is the patio bar serving me the weakest long island ever
it is nice to have other options at the mall for food and the food was good enough
he said his team didnt make the playoffs
i understood since the menu said the onions were extra
this place is always great
they had a number of bottled beers but i can get that at woodmans
this was a complete flop
the second rule of mandarin bar is
food was mediocre for a restaurant of this caliberi was honestly disappointed
du gros niaisage pis bin du monde du donc je vous suggre daller dpenser votre argent ailleurs
i have eaten at the stone and vine in chandler several times
i loved that you could get beer flights that was one of the highlights
never had seafood but everyone who has had it says its really good
we settled on the salmon which was good but nothing special
we all know that the last thing you want to have to worry about while walking around inebriated is holding onto yo drink
the pork meat itself wasnt half bad but i think it had been cooking for a little bit too long as it was kind of tough
we simply wanted to view our cocktails being built given thats part of the reasoning for the extra price i would have to imagine
we always have serendipity for desserts here during the hot summer months but this might be my new goto for ice cream treats
overall worth a look at least once
a forever highfive to bar my new favorite local bar
food is good a little pricy just under 60 for two to eat
really makes you feel important for coming out
just an fyi
give me dive bar with pool tables and dart boards and im good for the night
one thing we liked was the  lighter side options on some of the pasta dishes which was perfect for my wife and daughter
the crowd was pretty friendly along with the service
salads are excellent too
wasnt a huge fan of this location
it was quite tasty but i think i would have rather tried some of the mac  cheese ive heard so much about or one of their other dishes
the place is great and you can choose a burger they have created which is what i did or you can build your own from scratch or make substitutes
but id have to echo some other yelpers xs is definitely better than marquee in my opinion
cest ma premire visite  ce bar sportif et je ne sais pas trop  quoi mattendre
we would have returned it but could not find our server or any other staff
as the name states this bar has bicycle paraphernalia everywhere wheels propped up as a wall bikes hung on the ceiling
although this place is lively i think i would much rather spend my time on the strip
i feel like the menu is missing things like smaller dishes for peeps who want to share or who dont necessarily need a big meal
we had the fresh pulled mozzarella and the fazzoletti pasta  both great choices
the friendly vibes from owner and staff makes this a cant miss spot
really good happy hour to serve even better food
this was a big deal and enough to get an eye roll
the cheese fries appetizer was not nearly as good as the server seemed to think it was
my husband and i went out here on friday evening
our server was courteous and attentive it was a pleasure to tip her at the end
they were all delicious but came in small portions 5 for each dish
we were the 3rd table in the resturant and ordered our food
i rather go to the one in gilbert
its a nice small place to have a business lunch or grab some food after work
they have a fun selection of cocktails and also different asian beers to choose from
wheres the chocolate
and you can see out but others cant see in
the smoked pork was good but not memorable
food is decent and beer was good
reason why i have a question mark behind the midori sour is because i got two in the earlier part of the evening from one bartender and was rejected by another one later so i dont know
though im too young for the era i kept thinking of rodney dangerfield and richard pryor
and taste like clean home cooking regardless the hour
i am not sure what the happy hour prices were but lets just say that the martinis were 5 according to our waitress
great olive oil in really tiny bowls bowl is too large a word for the microscopic amount
but this time i thought i could taste the chlorinated phoenix water in the drink
this place is great
this is such a charming location with very nice wine
i got the al pastor and carnitas and i wasnt that impressed
if youre craving pizza and wings then get here asap
we finally had to go get her and request the english muffin syrup and orange juice
its hard for restaurants to earn a 5 star review from me but i think i found my 5 star in pittsburgh
they were cooked the way he asked well done and he cleaned his plate usually a good sign
the menu is very italian based they do have your normal pub fare however
we got the hot dog wrapped in bacon crispy
instead of asking who had ordered what course the busboys automatically knew and placed your course in front of you
while waiting i read off some trivia questions to my friends
it housed at least five tv screens with hiphop rb jams curved black leather sofas and the dreamy multicolored night sky ceiling
also she ordered medium and i medium wellboth were well done
bambinos has a pretty darn good happy hour and very friendly service
love coming here the staff is great
the egg sandwich was yummy but i cant see myself paying almost 20 for coffee and a sandwich
my blackened beef patty came on the softest onion kaiser roll with horseradish cream gorgonzola and caramelized onions
good mix of people not alot of asu students but not alot of families
also she kept placing delivered items on the far side of our round booth table
i tried one of the molecular drinksblack truffleand words cant even describe the flavour
as an entree i ordered the mushroom burger and that  also tasty and small
would go again
hot house cafe is somewhat of a landmark in the st lawrence market
the filet itself is great but the added flavor of the wasabi crust make it both different and delicious as the same time
first off he kept referring to us as girls which i found rude
after our spice fest nearby we decided to check out the new boba kid on the block cafe teaze
and i have this special jennifer ks trio combine tacos 1495
the fries were not good
there were other wonderful selections though that more than made up for the lack  the northern eggs benedict was yum
really small portion size but it was good fried calamari and okonomiyaki
it was a real fine dining experience and one for the books
best burgers in town
i always thought pitchers were better bang for your buck
unfortunately i didnt know that ahead of time so we arrived for a 10pm reservation on a friday night
i loved it
let me repeat that again a full stamp like the ones you get at disneyland   later that night in the reentry way the security claims that my stamp wasnt clear enough for the club and that i had to immediately go back to general admission to purchase a new ticket
i like the laid back music i like the dim lighting hey i am getting to that age and heck i can use all the help i can get
the foie gras was not delicious like how ive had it in other places
the comedy relief was a nice unexpected touch as this portion of the event isnt advertised anywhere at the box office
the one positive thing i will say about this place is that they have live entertainment on the weekends but this also drives a very unusual crowd
the golfing aspect is cool
my girlfriend got a bloody mary that i am pretty sure could have served as a meal in itself
the chicken is spicy but not so hot that you need to desperately gulp water down
when im at home i tend to prefer a straight up single malt if im not having beer or wine
the food is nothing more than a panera bread chain quality
it is a good location for me since i only live a couple miles away
a long and narrow strip along the side of the building its somewhat sheltered from the din of king street
its a compounding problem a person goes there and sees how empty it feels and remembers that the next time heshe wants to go out and spreads the word of the diminished vibe
came to casa don juan on tuesday and ordered the green sauce chilaquiles with steak and i must say they were delicious i really recommend this dish
i will definitely be back
i would kill for a 35 star
the kobe beef meatball and their sangria is a good enough reason to spark my return
they are stuck up and rude
i meanthis is big with him because with him being vegetarian not a lot of great choices out there
i then told the manager i will be writing a bad review on yelp she replied i know huh worst worst worst service ever  update contact the manager brian told him about my situation and and compliant very respectful and understanding was advised some of the hooter girls were new so i understand ill be back to that hooters thanks brian
if i did live in gilbert i would probably be here every sunday
will never step foot in here again
do not eat here
they have some tasty concoctions including their drunken monkey which is my favorite
he looked at his place setting after finishing and commented that he had not used his knife
the service was excellent and i would come back in a heartbeat whenever visiting scottsdale
even if youre in the upstairs lounge you have to order one of these
the main dish was a very gamey lamb dish with too much spice on it i couldnt finish it very well
the minute you get there youre awed by the beautiful decor from the entrance to the check in lobby to your room
my caprese arrived first fried green tomatoes fresh mozz  a fig basalmic
i think their goal is to promote a fun friendly and engaging atmosphere
i was extremely disappointed to learn my jameson wings now only come smoked
i guess bulgogi in vegas means it has broth or something
the only negative was that at 3am they cut out the music quite abruptly
also there is unlimited wine that they give you with any entree
the barkeep also introduced me to a tequila called salt which was amazing
you stuck at that shitty hospital across the street
the dj definitely brought the beats
all in all id go back just to sample the beer and grab that beef dip again
the crab cakes are to die for little spicy sauce gives them a kick
thanks for this good food
the eggplant was sliced thin and the sauce was delicious
french fries are crispy and our in the sandwich
decent beer specials
it was nice to be able to check out the observation deck after we finished our meal too
anyway frankies doesnt serve food but will order you pizza or you can go get food and bring it in
then the manager moved us and we were still not where all the action was
plus instruments and types of singing throughout the world
party of 2
best beer selection ive seen so far and a really great atmosphere with live music on the friday night i went there
we tried the frites the turkey leg a cheese board and the pork belly basically like pork rinds and the fondue
were talking at least 30
i have now upgraded my review to 5 stars
amaro meatloaf not bad thats all
specifically we started with fried pickles
my girlfriend had the steak and it was easily one of the best steaks ive tasted in toronto
my one qualm with this dish is that its not served with bread to soak up the broth
meal of choice pretzel chicken dipped in mustard ale
this club is visually impressive and worth checking out even if you arent a club goer
great selection of line dancing
the thom ka has never been right it is okay but has way too much tofu the flavor is just slightly off and you continually have to pick lemongrass out of the soup
you definitely go here for an eating experience not a dining one
i am new in town and i am sure that there are better places to have a drink
you can never go wrong with karaoke
next is the noise
if they had liver pate i would have really been transported in time
while it was great that he did this it didnt seem too sincere and i was actually surprised that the manager didnt come out to talk to us to make sure this whole thing was resolved
to start the decor and feel of the bar is fantastic
i knew right away that i was being checked against whatever hooker list they have
above average wings fast and nice service a good atmosphere if a game is on a great patio on a hot day
audience participation  people who dont mind making fools of themselves makes for a good time
i like this place for all of the reasons listed previously
the best part for dancing in the back where the entranceexit elevators are is the bestest dance area if you really want to express yourself to the music
jeff got monterey jack cheese peppered bacon and avacado that was simple but delicious
we had a group of 10 and had excellent service from marie
h ja det fortalte jeg dig jo til at starte med
but it wasnt spicy at all
the whole place is a fun atmosphere
warning  bugs  worst experience ever
we finally ordered from the limited menu only to be told that what we wanted was not available
so many things to look at and the beer was amazing
and i also ordered a coke which tasted like flavored water
i wanted to walk out
although the prices of the tapas fairly high but hey its vegas
and my one regret of the whole evening was that i never got the chance to see and hear clarence clemmons live
thats just a fact right
this place wouldve received a better review had we gone just for dinner however our group went for dinner as well as the fun factor that they advertise
they had a full pan of asparagus spears that were cooked perfectly
always a crowd here
rib eye with couscous the meat was so tender  marinated very well
if you are with a big group of friends for some beers this is perfect
make sure when u go to sls to only deal with amir for your night time entertainment
i would love to give kennedys 4 stars but they just havent quite earned that in my book
no need to
300 down the drain because of wrongly forfeited tickets
i really enjoyed talking to them and getting a flavor of all of the different beers
2 stars because of the pricingcome on i consider this place a dive bar
went here for my birthday dinner with my hubby and parents on a sunday night
but i must admit this is still one of my favorite bars
they also own the clubhouse handy huh
our server was reina and she is fabulous
at least i know where all the cool kids go while in vegas
we were greeted and seated immediately
but i made sure to go back twice after that before forming an opinion
but nothing impressed me much except the milkshake
i called the manager and he asked  what can i do for you
the dining room was super nice and clean
the inside of the club is aesthetically pleasing with a nice dance floor
if i were a chain smoker id never leave
the wine flights were a lot of fun too
also if youre a whiskey drinker the barrel aged whiskey cocktail is delicious
we loved their beer selection and the bartenders were all on top of everything helpful and efficient
it was somehow too much topping without being much of anything
visited this location at the sky harbor airport terminal four on my way out of town
20 minutes later she finally brought refills and i never got the water i ordered our food finally came and it was mediocre my lettuce wraps were tiny shrimp and the romaine lettuce was all wilty and broken had to ask for more the tots were burnt or the oil was old just overall not that great of an experience
overall a good experience with the food being the best part
not a fan i find it pretty excessive they charge a cover 6 just to go have an average dinner on the patio
i went to a show at the mirage last night and decided to have dinner there
that being said its easy enough to ignore those beers and not drink them if you want to drink something else
it was a little cold and drafty in there though on a really cold winter evening and we were not next to the door but that was my only complaint
too bad for me that im not white like every person in this bar
im finally glad this establishment is in that location and its there to stay
this bar is way too small for shows but they go ahead and have them anyway
some garlic bread would have been a nice addition
he was very professional and made sure to ask questions even i was not aware to ask to prepare for the day
and we were certainly not disappointed
this place is pretty cool
first the service is abysmal
ots is located in a mini mall in the back of a large parking area with other stores and shops
id recommend the breakfast burrito which was ordered by almost the whole table
i really love the cajun food here
from 1 out of 2 friends who got in after 5 min the purse got stolen
bachelorette party this past weekend and one of the gals made reservations here
gotta check out their shot wheel or whatever they call it a giant wheel o drinks that i believe is 9 to spin  drink what you win
i just wish it wasnt so far
if youre reading this trying to figure out where to eat right now i hope your decision ends now and you dont even make it to the end of this review because youre already on your way to barroco
our drinks came right out
einige von uns hatten dann auch nichts mehr in ihren glsern wir wurden aber auch gar nicht mehr gefragt ob wir noch etwas wollten
my friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred
i would have given it 5stars but my bartender was cocky
4 stars for a great appealing and different menu the alcohol atmosphere and the service
the must must try is the donut holes with chocolate and cream fillings
this is your run of the mill plateau hippie bar
the bar is well stocked and bartenders are fun and attentive
so it is kind of dimly lit and you can buy weird condoms in the bathroom and it smells like smoke but you cannot beat their lunch deals
i would probably go back and try something else but for my first visit the sandwich did not impress me
has great action at the bar
id wanted to get here for happy hour since the prices are incredible for that but once i saw the very limited food options i was okay with our arrival time
we ended up paying 30 to valet at nyny
this place was amazing
theres very little in the way of flavorful food that i can have without giving me a terrible stomachache
all was very tasty and along with the beer i was one very satisfied lady indeed
i suppose punctuality is not a welcomed manner here at the brand
overpriced bland food and horrible service
we were seated outside heated patio which was a bit chilly but made better with the fluffy white blankets and comfy couches you got to sit on
about 10 minutes from the time we sat at our table to even greet us and ask if we wanted anything to drink
pretty much just your average sports bar
i love bw3
but the table being small there really was no place to put the spent plates and utensils
on the next trip i had the gnocchi with pesto snow peas and wild mushroom
the girls were free the guys were discounted at 30 wtf is general admission price then for this club
i hadnt bothered to try soyo til i got dragged here lol
younger a little hip
first time visiting the other day
if you are looking for romantic the outside patio is incomparable
all the manager had to say was well they dont get paid to be smart
they get good stars for a lot of vegetarianvegan options good service and a dog friendly patio
youd never know they have only been open a few weeks
i think i read someones review that called the place a hipster hangout ive never heard a more inaccurate statement made about this particular establishment
bad and few tvs
the triples plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad
second i ordered hot dang shrimp  the portion was microscopic for 11 and the taste was disgusting
we ended up getting forced to buy a coke product cause that was on tap and had refills
the experience is pretty consistent here
i would go back to try other items on the menu and watch a sports game on the 2nd floor where they have a large tv over a chimney ad comfy looking couches
this not thin crust pizza
but they had a trailer one of the catering ones parked out in front of walgreens
i personally dont drink beer but i do know from others that they have a fantastic beer selection and of course they have wine as well
a last minute cancellation afforded me the rare opportunity to have a weeknight dinner at a normal persons time so i decided to redeem one of my many read too many groupons
not once did the server introduce himself ask us if we need anything or checked on us
didnt do the bottomless though
plus why would you use bacon crumbles in a sandwich
we asked to speak to the manager and we were told no
i may have picked a bad day to go but i think service and quality of food should be great monday thru sunday
we also had a 6 inch pizza which was piping hot and had nice crispy slices of pepperoni on top
i love me some chicken wings so thought i would suggest this place for a friend in town on business as a place to grab some wings
if you cook german at home already youve already got a good background headstart
their old jackalope 10 seasonal was strong and tasty and i also enjoyed an orangevanilla accented ipa
i will not be returning here given the plethora of amazing dining options in vegas
tried the savoury donut which is a crispy donut filled with macsween haggis bone marrow aioli and crispy onion
the omelette bar featured local ingredients schreiners sausage and some fun alternatives to the norm
i had never cancelled an order and i do not fault the waitress as she checked on it 1520 min in
i ordered a glass of wine and found the service to be sloowww even though the barmaid was not busy
you had to request pasta with the dish when ordering
sushisamba offers high quality food and ingredients but it was all underwelming
the broth is too murky and not clean and clear like its suppose to be
their golden beet  praline salad over orange sherry vinaigrette was also notable
food was ok  came out a bit cold though
we had the blue cheese and bacon fries as an appetizerinsanethe bacon was perfectly crispy and the fries were super crisp
so it was my birthday
i likely wont be returning
and the bartender
my expectations werent super high but i also wasnt super disappointed
found the place dark and unattractive but then it is meant to be a bar
i was also surprised at the lack of variety of the menu
people say it is diverse but if you call all asian and white or at least light in skin color diverse you need to get out of your bubble more often
at this point i think the velvet tango room is my new spot
the last time i went in here on a thursday night i told the waitress i needed a minute to look over the menu she left me and never came back
burger and the ronin burger and all seem satisfied with their menu selection
sadly though it looked as if they just grabbed some wings that just got done and dusted the parmesan on them
its not everyday that i get to feel like andrew zimmern and a pbj with bacon and jalapenos sounded straight off of an albeit tame episode of bizarre foods
pastrami  swiss on a fresh sub roll was delicious
the drinks were kept filled and the food was hot on delivery
i went today and got a chicken burger
i would not recommend this restaurant as a 150 bill with tip for 5 on a night with 3 tacos and 2 for 1 margaritas was very pricey
dont overlook us
we tried the garlic shrimp the last time as our appetizer and wowwee
great service good atmosphere
doesnt do much good for those of us in ahwatukee tempe chandler
i felt like i was eating cardboard with onionsmy burger would rate a zero star
its still very early in the going but i think roman bistro is off to a great start
this is a great place to grab a quick drink and enjoy a bit of conversation
we left but had no options to eat as everything was full up
service was excellent
just an overall friendly vibe
the tacos are small more on the sweet side and not spicy just ok also sampled my friends shrimp mushroom  swordfish tacos
we have had salads sandwiches burgers and breakfast
i cant say thats a bad thing at all
the search continues for the hip swanky whiskey bar of my dreams
this place was gross
menu has a good selection of items i would try
ive discovered the secret to coping with overwhelmingly crowded shopping malls
i looked to the back and saw the outdoor patio and large canvas coverings and said oooohh lets go here
we had 4 nights in town and wanted to spend our time at stoneys but everyone refused to return due to the excessive sound level
if you are going to go to a casino to pay a lot for a thick burger there are other options
expect long waits and crowded environment but its worth it
literally a small metal shopping basket
while the sushi was fabulous it was disconcerting having a very strong grilled meat smell coming from the neighboring table
second was miso scallop and chardonnay
seriously it was a bunch of old folks and firsttimers with an awful atmosphere
get here early and be prepared to make new friends because everybody shares booths and pitchers at the end of the night
they went down really easily with our meals
i was never offered an opportunity to defend my position
some might think well thats just silly spending 60 on a burger but it does come with a dessert or shake of your choice
we had appetizers first course second course and dessert
the only issue was that music was to start at 900pmwe left at 1030 and the music still had not begun
i had the salmon and it was so overcooked it was tough
admission is 20 less if you are a senior or a kid
the door guy did a very thorough patdown of the males which i found it to be quite creepy
salmon was slightly over cooked but nothing to complain about
theres cafes that dont break the bank and a nightclub tryst that i am also a fan of in this property
cant ever go wrong with the happy hour here
when i realized it later anita offered to take care of it but again i waited in line when i went down
i will be back for sure
we ordered so much they probably thought we had he munchies no we just wanted a little of everything
my boyfriend and i were in the area this weekend and didnt know where to eat lunch
the steak and seafood tower are the best
went to hexx for breakfest and was dissapointed
but there is definitely better value along king and other parts of the city ossington even yorkville  different scenes but still a good time
i just wanted to trade in 2 claws for more tail but he gave me everything to make sure i was happy
who doesnt look sexy by tealight
if you appreciate rawreal comedy please go see him
i call the front desk and she was sending up someone to get new room keys and to move us
from the menu to the exceptional customer service you will not be disappointed
my husbands sandwich was good corn beef hash but cold fries he asked for different fries but they never arrived
checked out this place on a monday night for the first time
the sushi was  and went ahead and ordered the monkey burrito
this is going to make the rotation of small dive bars in our area to frequent
i also experience the lack of food quality with a boston pizza in the area
the burger came about 15 minutes after we finish the fries
so much fun
overall i enjoyed my fish fry at laurel tavern for a townie stop
it happened againsomething that can occur with a stop at giligins
this place has great potential
so big points for the first dish
a great place for ladies night or date night
i think its like 250 bucks for a huge water cooler size jug
seriously so good
the over salting was really jarring
because im difficult i get it with blackened chicken and crawfish over mashed potatoes rather than white rice
handsdown the best restaurant on mill
the mojitos are fantastic
service was great and food came out spaced good
karaage was basically a deep fried chicken finished with spray of salts
this was our first time there and the first impression was rotten
we have been a couple times with our toddler and she loves the rice and little chicken tacos
sometimes i dont want to make new friends
i liked the vibe and it was happening on a friday night
it was last minute and the night of santana opening up his show but they fit us in in the time frame we wanted without a problem
the patrons are occasionally rowdy sometimes hostile
chocolate  caramel and raspberry
the mac and cheese was bland but im very picky about my mac and cheese
service was ok i am from texas and this is not texas bbq
you could be at a quite table or with a loud party and still have you own unique experience
what a great dinning experience at a restaurant by the famous gordon ramsay
both were excellent tasty and awesome
we sat inside and enjoyed some hockey on two tvs while waiting for our food
and quick  efficient
i have to say ive never had a bad item on their menu even the non meat items are delicious and im a meat eater thru and thru
and every time i have friends visiting i try to bring them in so they can experience fizz too
and the beefsteak tomato on it was so delicious
cons the music that particularly night i was just not quite feeling it
all were excellent and large portions
overall i would only want to come here for the food its ridiculously cheap
retire that in 2015 i tried to take a photo but someone came up from behind and touched me to stop
my kid ordered fajitas and the wraps came out 20min before the rest of her dinner
the food was horrible along with their service and prices were through the roof
he comes right back and tells us they might be out of the batter for those pancakes and the kitchen wants to know if he would like something small to eat in the meantime
cheap drinks check
yeah i know
and i told him noand i showed him the piece of metal and told him what happened and he was shocked too and he told his manager the manager came a lady didnt get a chance to get her name apologized and she said that they will take care of the check or tab  and she took the piece of metal and the pasta right away and i didnt get a chance to take a picture of it because i was shocked and choking
i love that it felt like an intimate speak easy to me
best thing about this place was the back patio on a nice evening and the margaritas so i would go back for happy hour
they even have a ramp to the dance floor
i walk in with my eyes adjusting from the suns rays
we were hoping for more strawberries but it seemed like it was 1 strawberry sliced and diced 100 times
ordered at 410p
for dessert they brought out injectable donut holesyes thats as good as it sounds
on samuse tout le temps au bar inc lambiance est cool  la musique y est toujours bonne un habile mlange de styles musicaux accompagnera votre passage le staff super sympa et la petite qui fesse complte tout groupe damis  merveille
being from los angeles im used to traditional mexican food so i can be a bit picky
metallica is ok but not much of a karaoke choicethen again if you are into it all power to you
they hooked us up with a lot of pita bread and hummus which i couldnt stop eating
hopefully she will soon be out of a job however if she isnt she can continue her career cleaning up after bar patrons who have real jobs
it tasted ok but for 9 i expected a lot more
i was very disappointed
service was divine we were seated quickly greeted warmly and educated on the menu
no butter for his toast either
hash browns the fact that the hashies came in huge hunks of hash brown pie was pretty awesome and ridiculous pecan pie dope and icecreamy fruit crepei  wasnt a fan  too passion fruity for me
my fiance and i made last minute reservations here for valentines day
yes i have to travel into downtown from middleton where my hotel is surrounded by mcchains and tgifried places but it is worth the trek for the crafted cuisine and engaging company you meet from boston
this is exactly the kind of concept of a place we would go to regularly but after tonight my husband said he wont go back
not of the league of mh in nyc or noble experiment in san diego but an a for honest effort
old couches and tables are scattered throughout the space for seating and a small raised platform infront of the multimedia control center is also sometimes used for seating
these margaritas and any other kinds of drinks you might fancy are available
food is not even separated in portionsexample you get a burger and its your job to split it somehow into 4 pieces
a must if you are visiting or live in gta and never been
my wine was nice and chilled though and the fish was tasty
discounts including a yelp deal are available
we were greeted immediately and advised that we could sit pretty much anywhere
the patrons attracted to this locale are often those that are above mid 40s harrahs itself is like a retirement community so it comes off as no surprise
i cant wait to go back for brunch
there are a lot of teenagers there but it is to be expected
i also nibbled on the waikiki great caramelized onions and the il diavolo super spicy
it would have been nice to have small lights above the food in order to see what you are eating
3 the food was lackluster
45 stars service was slow to begin with but when daisy finally made it over she was all over my dining partner and i  very responsive fun and efficient
no i did not have all 6 but are you kidding me with those prices
pretty small as well and the wait was a lot longer than it was a year ago
the mixture of kimchi miso butter and cheese curds is not necessarily a combination you would expect to work but somehow it does
and the choices dont just range from pico de gallo to hot to hotter
the servers here are extremely knowledgeable about all things beer  i got a great recommendation chill winston which paired nicely with the charcuterie board
its full of different flavors that come in waves
8 for a margarita in a 10oz plastic cupreally 8
it came not on the rocks with a lime
best thing to do is have respect for yourself
but do be warned if you are with a large group call ahead or get there early as this can get crammed up easily and definitely try to take over the basement
we usually sit in the bar area at one of the high tops since the boyfriend loves football and can watch the game and act like hes paying attention to me lol  we order drinks and place our orders within 510 minutes of sitting down
our waitress is the only reason there is 2 stars im not sure of her name but she was very nice very understanding and decently attentive for how packed the place was
if it was just the plumbing in this room id understand but multiple people complained about it during our stay i would have paid 60 more a night if i would have known that if have a better experience at the motel 6 down the street
way too much and the people sitting next to us felt the same way
no big deal
overall i felt appreciated and wanted
this place is family
what happens in vegas go big or go home please
obviously management was lying
but the burgers really were good
this is a wordy review but im not going to apologize
i give it 1 star for jalapeo poppers needed to be roasted longer
horrible customer service
servers were slow but the bartenders were good
i visited the double door on two occasions while in vegas many many years ago
they have sake bombs and jello shots for those of us who want to not drop 5 on a little tiny drink
as a memphis bbq fan i wasnt quite sure what to expect from cleveland bbq
back to myvegas slots
la slection de breuvages varie des cafs alcooliss aux drinks rguliers en passant par les classiques ths  tisanes
this garnered the attention of a party of two ladies who checked out the photos before one of them remembered they had the yelp app on their phone
if you want a good selection of tasty north carolina beers do as their slogan suggests and  ahem  tap some ass clown
we go to scarf our dinner as furniture was being moved all around us
my main pet peeves at typical vegas pools are the chairs stacked basically on top of each other and the inability to find a waitress  not an issue here
we were so happy that we wanted more
i feel you pay for the scenery and atmosphere totally worth it
had my first visit here last night after joining some folks for a run in that neighborhood
not a huge portion
those are the only things i can point to as a critique
in the booking options we were given multiple different choices and i specifically picked king non smoking
the food was lacking to say the least
after reading the reviews i decided on the pappardelle with with pulled brisket tomatoes garlic and fresh herbs
there was not a soul in the bar
i dont know what it is about this place but it is a must go to when i am in vegas
everything is reasonably priced definitely one to try if youre in the area
nonmeat options are clearly stated on the menu fries veggie dogs etc
when i was seated i asked the waitress if the happy hour beer specials were in the bar only or the whole restaurant
it was cooked a little more medium but still very tasty
when youre a table of two and you see 4 other tables one being 6 get their food before you receive yours you begin to wonder if perhaps there may be some preferential treatment here
what this place teaches me about myself another year older another year closer to death
burger madness back in business at mission  minder binders went there this week what a blast great food and craft beer on tap
the next day my parents were in the area looking for a dogfriendly spot so we had to take them back here
nice bar area and the lanes are nice
yes was cooked as asked which is good
the out door terrace was the main attraction
maybe a little more sauce is needed to hide the taste of grease
she recommended me to get oxtail pho so i did
waited another 5 minutes for the 2nd meal an appetizer of 7 for a few asparagus spears
finally found the best burger place in town
they even have a selection of blended brews
if you want fancy overpriced head to cesars
we had the cheese appetizer heirloom tomato salad lobster  shrimp bisque ahi tuna steak and gulf white shrimp with jonah lump crabplus the crab fried rice and the broccolini
anthony cools is a funny guy with great stage presence but it really was the audience members who volunteered to be hypnotized that really made the show
way too crowded
we had a different server this time and we still had to repeatedly remind her about our drinks
we decided to share a bunch of appetizers and entrees among us and the standouts were the grits yes the grits and the corn as appetizers
there was long wait line but the hosts were attentive enough to come by and check every 5mins with drink offers
the main draw though are all the things and activities to do
both were very good
house of comedy is a nice spot and ill certainly come back
i came here to play pool on a night when there was a gig getting ready to start on stage which seemed fun until it started getting crowded and people kept bumping into my friends and i while we played pool
but it was so worth it
appetizer was gross waitress looked completely bored it was all fine but i expected at least good
tickets for this show are reasonable compared to other shows like o
both were delicious and came with a side we tried the cole slaw and the side salad
our server was lauren and she was very nice and made sure our glasses were kept full
the only thing bad about it is the service which is not just bad its fucking retarded
lotus of siam is by far the best
one bartender and the three patrons seemed to be ownership
ill admit it might not be as good as lotus of siam but for those that arent foodies or even tasted authentic thai food you wont actually notice the difference except for the hype
i am not trying to stand in a line 376 people deep only to get herded into another line with even more people
lots of tvs and good vibes only
if they held any of my favorite house djs ill be back or someone holds their birthdaybachelorette party here
i love a weekend happy hour
and i think its because either im not a regular or i dont have the right body parts
wish it was closer to my house id be a regular
however i will remember this in the future
i guess cash in hand for customers who are at your location isnt as good as people who currently are not at your location
not the best burgers ever but pretty decent
food has always been good
i tried a few bites of my fiances milano pasta troife which was absolutely amazing  succulent pieces of shrimp and sausage in pasta and a flavorful garlic sauce
this time right in summerlin
she also got fries cooked in peanut oil and awesome
if its a bit on the empty side you can feel the conversation bounce around the room
sort of a dive but friendly with two pool tables
service was suuuperb
fries and shakes arent bad either
shaun was amazing
the portion was as expected big  shareable yet they werent the best nachos ever
i guess theyre known for their drinks
i am also very tempted by the spa casino this casino is one of the cleanest ive ever seen
good service good food and great place for family dinner
my favorite restaurant in town
its not a place i want to chill at for drinks just a place to get an amazing grass fed beef burger
its not even a matter of the price of water
i could tell that the bananas were frozen the brownies were gross it was just bad overall
we were polite and whatever then his sasquatch friend came out not even kidding this guy is like 65 while all us girls are like 54  under then once we opened our door to go in sasquatch pried himself into our room  refused to get out so 3 of my tiny friends had to push that fool out of our room
the atmosphere is cozy and intimate
bachi burger belongs on the strip
my stepdad tried to talk to the bartender about the four german draft beers on thier list and was pretty much blown off if not insulted
i was so excited to try guys new place in vegas
we came in for sunday brunch a few weeks ago and there was a live band absolutely blasting music so loud my date and i couldnt even talk to each other sitting very close
after traveling over 22 hours we decided to eat dinner at the conveniently located bisque at the best western bruntsfield inn
the floor was disgusting
i couldnt eat it
it was thick and chunky and quite frankly disgusting
one of the employees who answered the phone claimed she was a manager and she is unable to help me however she will take all of my information and manager brian will call me as soon as he gets in
its a 5 stars
i love the low lighting
one end of the room has old school astro turf as its flooring
that explains why he was overly pressuring us to order drinks
the place was very busy and loud
i also love their oven fresh bread with the olive oil  pesto dipping sauce
it is not a pub but his food is so much better and would rate it a 5 over this 2 if you are a total rewards person be sure you tell them for that big 1 off per selection
the portions are generous and the naan was very good also
my friend got some turkey chili
you get to experience vegas without mobs of people downstairs in the casino
split one appetizer and one entre and drinks for a table of two
their beer prices are outrageous
out of all the margaritas i have downed in the last few years this was the worst
but i have to say i might be one now
i slid a hundred into a poker machine and pressed sticky buttons
the only issue was that we wished they were bigger
regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space complete with standard tables and chairs
went here with a large group for a birthday party
when we picked it up the guy told us its best to get on the guest list of the clubs you want to go to before showing up with the v card for hassle free entry
nice patio outside on a secluded side street really interesting menu and a wide array of beer wine cocktails and sake
offer good room service and make the sundries people want available to buy in the shops downstairs
chips were cold and stale salsa wasnt good and we paid to have a the chunky salsa and that was a let down as well
can only speak about the pizza and service
i wish i could remember the servers name but she was fast and friendly
i think my favorite part was the service
the fries are crispy and seasoned perfectly
this exclusive bar is a interesting place to check out but needing to have a membership kind of takes away from its appeal
this is a personal favorite spot of mine
a terrific addition to the neighborhood
it wad our dining companions first time here and he asked for a budweiser the pretentious server said they only served their own brews
this restaurant is truly worth the 5 stars
every sandwich also came with a side and for mine i selected mixed fruit
after paying i took the opportunity to check out the changes since i had been there before
not much parking
only when i got up to grt my own did he try to assist
and if you dont you ask someone that does
definitely recommend this one to others
my date and i literally only customers on a cold thurs night
individually loaded each chip
next while we were waiting for our food over an hour just to let you know my wife took our 4 month old for a walk outside
we ordered a bottle of burgundy style pinot noir that was heavenly
our waitress was slow and had no knowledge about the specials on the board
i liked that they offered daily food and drink specials
and  drumroll please fried oreos
rock killed it
i ordered the carnitas street tacos
server oh ok go ahead
some are jus down right strange but so be it
ich kannte die rosenau bisher von erstklassigen kulturveranstaltungen
entertainment was great
thanks for making it a very memorable night
2 off signature cocktails during happy hour
it made for a very exhilarating experience
my friend and i both ordered without realizing their tuesday special of whole lobster over linguini
my omelette was cooked to perfection
gold standard with skinny fries and the turkey burger are a must if you come here
robert the general manager is a pretty good guy too
i only stopped in with a few friends for drink at the fat cat wine bar
there is cute irish riverdancelike music that goes on below
the wait staff was great and the food was tasty
tips are encouraged
apples  pears     petite ferme     aureus     simon girty     funky peach     r2 koelschip ale they were all awesome
was at the morrissey show 112011
then she told me to sit at the bar
dont like the trek to the restroom as i was lead thru the stand where the wait staff are picking up food and i felt a bit out of place and in the way
we sat at the bar hoping we could get a couple of drinks in
all other food is mediocre at best
most thai places do not make it spicy like i ask and they always spice it up for me
my friend boyfriend and i decided to go for ladies night  karaoke
i realize that the 2 new towers are the place to be but its still no excuse for renting out ratty rooms for the prices theyre charging
it is a small restaurant with a small bar  but the place feels just right
jamie m mentioned having trouble finding a vegetarian option there but i have not had a problem
and also its a bit overpriced with the fact it cost me 9 for a can beer and 11 for a cocktail drink
barely any food
there are 3 lines to get into the club
i have no idea how the food actually is but was given the 12 pizza on my way out with parting word to not order the 12 thin crust to go because they just dont hold up well for travel
the meatloaf also isnt bad or their burgers but like i said quality that we have expected from a great dane restaurant just isnt there anymore
but why would you only put 2 bathrooms in when your club is that big
this has literally happened to me every single time ive gone to melt
tonights peppered steak had sirloin pieces leeks zucchini and stilton cheese
the service to order dessert and refill water was slow
the flatbread pizza pretzels spam sliders and burgers are amazing and the menu is constantly evolving
the hubs and i came here for a late lunch on sunday
so yum they pour chambord  bubbling confetti on top of champs all for 8
he said he would give us boxes to take it home and he would take care of the meals for us
if you are on a tight budget this is your spot though
we cannot wait to go back and try more of the dishes and we are really looking forward to when they start doing the famous bloody mary bar
chicken nachos were delish
theyre very relaxed and its the place to go if youre looking to have a nice layed back dining experience
just hard to get reservations last minute
but the star of the meal was this unassuming little bowl of perfection they called cheddar grits
great food ambience and service
papaya salad soft shell crab noodles drunken noodles pad thai fried prawns the soup that could have been my last meal and i wouldve been fine with that
my husband had the scallops with risotto and i had the crab ravioliwe both enjoyed the scallops but the crab ravioli was very averagewhat was really irritating about this dish was that it was featured on the rachael ray show and it had crab meat on top as well as inside the raviolinot on mine however
i had a hard time deciding between the scallops the halibut and the meatloaf
start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and youll bring the locals in
they came with a very tasty dipping sauce
the flavor was outstanding in both but neither burger was cooked the way they were ordered
real crab not imitation
im not suggesting they do standard mexican fare rather that they keep a dishs integrity
if we had known about the turn down service we would have turned on our privacy sign on our door
the salad came with a tasty flatbread pizza slice too
the bread was served with maple butter and was ok not the best i have ever had but not the worst
instead of just letting me go get it i was told to leave   and then while waiting for my friends they wouldnt stop harassing me
the steaks were big and the cocktails were too
and convenient if in caesars
vibe here is great
they do not accept cards
steak was okay but when you do not get what you ordered it is disappointing
i gave mine to jen because i just didnt want to drink
definitely recommend if youre an adventurous type
so i ask her if shes got any club soda to which she replies  do you want me to bring you dish soap
i hate country music
nit at midnight
the manner in which he carried out the conversation was very coward like and unsure
first time and i love this place
its basically a bowl of clams in a buttery sauce of awesomeness
our party was 11 girls
it has great service cleanliness and friendliness
i am not a big fan of country music so that added to me not really enjoying myself
best happy hour for fooddrinks
she said listen i dont care how many zappos ids you have because we didnt even know your entire company was showing up until you did
they hand you two picture perfect ice frosted mugs filled with your favorite brew and you realize this place isnt for amateurs
in fact boar belly was porkfat chicharrony crunch savoury oily cholesterol bite of death
comedy club is nice big acts in the heart of downtown
i can understand why they do their best to get girls in because there just were not a lot of ladies in there
my soup was perfectly creamy with cream mozarella herbs and a generous portion of gnocchi
its not just another carson st gastropub the menu is unique and creative and the beer list never disappoints
for example i ordered two different kinds of summer rolls shrimp and pork
our last course was the chocolate cream puff with vanilla custard and a side of strawberry and mango jelly
ill be back to try more of their foods
i like the restaurant it so it looks very nice with good vibe if you want to try something different definitely check out urban turban
when we arrived we were asked to wait at the bar even though half of the room had open tables
the spicy tuna though is part of the reason for a star deduction
we have now experienced happy hour brunch lunch and dinner at perfect pear bistro in its original ahwatukee foothills location and cant say enough good things about it
the lack of engaging bartenders was made up with the excellent beer selectionthough i didnt have wine the selection appeared to be even better
it didnt take long for me to notice they dont have draft beer only bottles
our meal at dresslers was hands down one of the best that weve eaten
we were at a badgers game and were hungry for some wings and a burger
this part i appreciate greatly because i place a high premium on space in a vegas club and the outside area provides that in bundles
great face place tho
the wings were sizeable but not a lot of flavour
as for the food the nua nam tok was flavorful but the meat was tough and chewy
when we told the waiter he began with the defensive routine and gave us a look like we didnt know what we were talking about
i even like that the ads in the bathroom stalls have not been updated in something like 3 years
kurz und knapp derzeit kann ich keine empfehlung mehr abgeben
probably would taste really good if you come in hungry late night lol services and environment 5 stars  nice atmosphere and very attentive services
definitely not a place for kids
before that all came out however i was served a bread basket that contained your stereotypical baguette and butter
so i scoured yelp for a nearby place for food  drinks to start the night off
id take a big smoke or burgers priest over this any day
service is slow indifferent and haughty
the sushi is good but again is just plain bland
mermaids is literally the best casino in vegas
first time here and we  enjoyed it
the potato cakes are also really tasty
my friends enjoyed the pad thai and i had the pork buns that were delicious  the drinks are great too
the patio is nice as well
some mild to moderate changes could make this a 4star place at least
and the fish was blackened something we werent aware
we turned up in good time for our reservation and were shown to a remote corner of the restaurant with no view even of the rest of the restaurant
black pepper sizzled filet mignon with udon noodles 35 stars noodles good and flavorful but filet mignon had too much black pepper and salt
he was very knowledgeable friendly and professional
they told me they dont take reservations
definitely a place id love to return to next time im in town
check other restaurant staff who delivered and made our food perfectly to our specifications
weve since came back under the new ownership and our experience was more enjoyable
the rice with andoulle sausage that was the side dish was actually worse
if forced to choose id go with  over joel robuchon considering the similar price point and for overall entertainment factor but you couldnt go wrong with either for a dinner and show all rolled up into one
not worth it
when we asked for the check we gave her a bogo entree coupon
but i digress
hands down one of the best meals i have ever had
my wife had the chicken parmigiana
they are always friendly and attentive and greet us by name
the bedford academy is an excellent place to enjoy the outdoor weather while taking down some pints of european beer and tasting good pub fare
lots of latin music
monsieur le grant il y a certainement un endroit discret pour discipliner vos employs
very fun atmosphere  decor
just as the chefowner admitted when he personally stopped by the table i spent some time working in miami so i learned a thing or two down there
not a good first visit
the place was super busy with a reunion going on as well as several families
lol like this dinner plate was brought out to us with a gosh darn espresso cup of dessert on it
everything here was good and for a reasonable price
whoevers on the calendar usually has some pretty cool stuff going on
ri ra has got to be my favorite place to visit when im in las vegas
my food was burnt and chicken was very dry
sometimes pure music with words and some old hip hop and some new hip hop with maybe a mix of just pip hits is just whats needed for some real fun
overall good selection of food good service just not good for big parties unless you want to order 3 or more orders of pineapple fried rice at 12 each to feed a party of 5
came to restaurant couple of times with my boyfriend after work
not the usual same 10 songs on rotation
the waiters are nice and the place really fancy
overpriced fair to average food small portions
cannot wait to come back
we ordered a few side items and some of us got fried chicken and the others got chicken tenders
the booths and the bathroom scream diner which is just not the type of interior im looking for when im eating sushi
first the service staff was very attentive and quick about their work
they have no pots of brewed coffee
my friend ordered the burger which was missing the cheese he asked for so when it came back it was cold and hard and tasteless his onion rings were also cold
the smoked paprika was my favorite
however i thought the eggplant was better
this place is sad
there is nothing quite like the common market plaza midwood
this is a great place for food or just drinks
it was bland and nothing special
either for another lunch date to try out the bowling lanes or just for a drink
plus the wait staff scoffed at us when we asked if they could perhaps turn it down a teensy bit
alright nothing amazing happened here
i also love their wings and i really have never had a bad meal here
i love seven saints
we tried the baguette burger and hangover burger
service is a lil slow
lo and behold my coupon was declined again
all were really tasty
is that even legal
lots of food for the price especially for a place on the strip in vegas
who knows but they lost a star for that
great service my dishes were hot fresh and tasty
i think i know a thing or two about decent thai food options here lol
even though you want more beer
so whats the point of asking
favorite spot to eat andddd drink after work always great service and atmosphere but be careful time slips away and the sun is up before you know it lol
more meat less cabbage filler to make the plate seem larger than it is please
i wont be going back to vegas anytime soon but i will definitely be going to the one in new york when i get the chance
will be back soon
back in 09 our total would come out to a lil under 13 bucks
this review is actually a comparisoncontrast and hopefully will give you a good idea what to expect
cool place and nice happy hour
they also usually have a 5 deal of the day which is an unbeatable price for what you get
i searched for steelers bars prior to leaving on a vegas vacation and would like to thank the other yelpers that gave me the great advice
the other bacons were great
also the bread with lard yes i said lard was so good
if you catch them on a special draft night then score if youre a beer lover
i also asked about how long they had been around and she told me that they opened in april 17
quite a few ipas browns pales lagers you name it
canadian celebrities thats why they have booths for like 30 people
i no longer live in toronto and after a long day working on a film down the street i craved  jamaican soup
i cant give 45 stars so the food quality and service pushes it to 5 i think the fare is a bit too high priced for the quantity of food but the quality was outstanding and the service was excellent
must be part of the bargaining with the liquor control board
the first time was with another couple
however there was about a 2030 minute delay between each of the 4 dishes which kind of put a damper on my stomach expectations but nevertheless it was worth the wait
the wings were very good
you cant argue with eggs and melty cheese
tommy vs takes pride in their service food and fine wines
cute outside patio and big tables on the inside for sitting and enjoying
deborah is the reason i give 4 out of 5 stars
was here for a stag party and the staff made discriminating comments to one of our party who happened to be a minority
the food taste like their isnt one fresh ingredient but rather it has been in the back of the freezer waiting for you to order up
crazy long lines and extravagant everything
when it is slow id expect the staff to be on the top of their game
as i havent been here before
i had been to abay around the corner funny how two ethiopian restaurants ended up right next to each other and i liked it much more than abay
joe and john besides being sexy you guys are top notch and this place definitely hands down
the interior is very nice new sorta has that flagstaff feel to it
service fabulous  they took care of us without having to ask for stuff
mouth consistency was plastic and taste was nonexistent
i ordered the chorizo mucho burro which was packed with flavor came with pineapple which seemed weird before i tried it but gave a wonderful savorysweet flavor and was covered in a white cheese sauce but none of that is not its main feature the thing was the size of my forearm
so this is the 2nd time i have been to a firebirds
the entire place is small in general but its never been too packed when ive gone on nights
we ordered their spicy mac and cheese and their stilton burger w cheesy potatoes on the side and split it three ways
this venue has a soft spot in my heart ive been here a handful of times 3 times for comedy acts and 2 times for a concert
this is the first place i recommend to people coming to madison for the first time
but this menu was perfect
everything was amazing
started with fresh oysters half east coast half west coast  i could have eaten a dozen more  delish
been here multiple times and the food is always good
my roommate and i came here for a friday lunch and there was a brief 10 min wait but the hostess still brought us cups of ice water
all in all its a cool place especially among all the other trashy clublike places that abound in that area
this was simple and delicious
i dont care how full you are even if you feel like you are about to burst you will try one bite of the butter cake and that glutenous masterpiece will create its own void in your gut to fit in as much as you can possibly eat
come here for a business lunch if you can expense it
hipster bar where the food is decent but the terrible wait staff and bar tenders arent worth the trouble
the 57happy hour is wonderful and they have several special nights during the week
we started with the nachos which were completely different from any nacho ive had before and now any other nacho is ruined for me
the food was the star of the show thoughi like how the menu was set up
server was good at the table so dont know where the problem was
the lucys pierogis were tasty and i would get them again
finally the owner is very charismatic and always greets his customers with a warm smile and converses with his regulars
lobster mash was unbelievable  with large pieces of meat very tasty and enough to serve 4 my very particular husband gave it a 10 that is a rareity
i get super indecisive when ordering at chain restaurants because most of the items are not worth the
ps the best way to eat the french toast is to pour the bananas foster over them and then eat everything
took my father there for his birthday
the beer was good and the mixed drinks were on point
ive never been here when there wasnt a game scheduled and ive never eaten off their menu either
it is not for everyone the patrons leave you well alone but acknowledge you
most of the time the staff people are amazing but there has been the one off night where the courtesy and friendliness is lacking
major dings for  no more open containers
i had asked for egg to be added to salad ya that didnt happen
the menu is small but varied enough
so next time i will check the street first and then if i have to park in the garagei will double check the validating
the server was so helpful to explain the menu and the food
i hate this place now
place has a narrow bar area with a cool little food kitchen im assuming that serves pizza
the way the tables are arranged in this small dark restaurant does not give you much privacy
i recommend this place to anyone i know
buikd it yourself or get it straight of their menu
this is better than tfdu
and that was genius cause it was all so good
after eating at cheescake factory i felt better but fat tuesdays defeated me
thats fine but i would like to do it with my after dinner scotch
they have quite a few regulars who are there every time im there
use the towel to wash the door handles before you walk out or get a vaccination when you leave but you walk in and it looks cool nice ac and a chill environment good service and attentiveness
and the sandwiches were superb is well
i ordered brussel sprouts for appetizer and half chicken as entree
despite the concierge recommendation to make a reservations for saturday night we thought wed wing it
finally decided to try it tonight and very happy we did so
very disappointing brunch today
that alone makes me not want to waste my time or money here on any future trip to vegas
we arrived around 715 and were told that it would be a 15 minute wait for a group of 4 people
he is intense
there were plenty of girls making the rounds and of course rotating through the main stage
the one thing i did not like about the tastings all were poured into the original glass
the cover charge amount is not the issueyes we did pay the extra 10 so we could get our food and drinks
salsa might not be everyones cup of tea but i thoroughly enjoyed myself and would love to come back and see if their dining experience has just as much to offer as their upstairs nightlife
she said no
ordered queen peach and white mint pretty sure the mint was completely forgotten
sort all these comments by date and read them
big strike against any establishment who tops sweet potato fries with more sweetness
it seems like all they care about is getting you to be foolish enough to pay the 10 cover and could care less if you have a good time
none of those amazed me or stayed in my tongue memory
note marquee is a ripoff
host didnt say a single word to us
patrons are never rushed
we have asked for years and dont understand why they dont get them
best dessert i have had in a long time and i couldnt even finish it
the plate i ordered above was 1287 with the tax
service was quick and very pleasant  but its a quiet sunday afternoon
then the topper was we got charged the dinner price for our scant lunch4more
the exact same problems i listed in my review nearly three years ago
the dish was capped by portobello mushrooms which were a little overpowering but when eaten separately they were rather good
yes they make all their beer in house
wide angle lens camera makes it look big but is smaller than my kitchen
there are however some downsides  1 it is really loud inside
he gave us suggestions on food and drink and was extremely personable
the servers are attentive and must know women day drinking 5 glasses of wine with their children in tow are very generous always responsibly obviouslytheres something to be said about a place that kids are allowed to play and mommy time is equally valued
not tried the food yet but it all looks great
might as well get some electrolytes while imbibing
the dopey female bartender finally served me after i waited 10 minutes
and it was
everyone would talk and laugh with us
the lemon cake is breathtaking
definitely a place for a group on the town
we had eaten dinner prior to coming here so we just ordered drinks
i like my porterhouse steak from mastros compared to michael minas
so just be well aware of this
angus beef burger wgruyere and caramelized onions
youll think youve turned into the wrong place
finally they make all pastas and sausages in house
my sister and i went here for a painting class and fell in love with their wines
the portions were large and most importantly the quality was beyond outstanding
i am told they no longer have that on tap and wasnt offered a bottle so i am not sure if they carry it anymore
i asked for another shot of the mix and she brought it
glad i got the onion rings rather than the fries and the you cant go wrong with the burgers
i gave one star for the spiceyness and cheese
drinks were pretty pricey and we ordered chips and guacamole for 7the guac came in a teeny tiny bowl that barely was enough for 2 people to share
tims has a a nice vibe and is a pretty good irish restaurant and pub
the singers came by every table and interacted with each one even when it got busier
it was delicious and refreshing
again heavenly  a perfect sized fillet with lovely skin and really tasty
like transporting yourself to nyc with its trendy beats in the background and the contemporary flair
we inhaled the popcorn as we hadnt really eaten anything all day
its right in the middle of the place and i recommend going on friday andor saturday between 3 and 7 for a similar experience to cap off your day andor to start the evening
unfortunately our experience from booking the reservation to leaving the restaurant left my family and i disappointed
well for the most part
they often have coupons as well and the service is good
the foods not bad and the service is amazing
stick to specials and youll do all right
but alas its closed
the wine pours could also be better
it took no time and we were set
if you are tired of standing in the long line for marquee i say forget about it and go here for some drinks which is what we did you will probably end up having just as much fun without feeling claustrophobic or getting elbowed every 5 seconds
ps pair the peas with a mint vinegar sauce instead of butter
the hot dogs are nothing special nor is one enough if youre hungry
i cant hear myself think
i often meet here with friends but always recommend to never order food
well here you go  a comfortable little bar area yes cocktails too in which to chill out at days end and catch the ball game of the day or vent about work
at this point our meal was getting to be so long i wanted it to be over we were approaching hour 3
these employees are a joke
cajun shrimp pasta skip it
chicken was dry and over cooked
this place is amazing the thai tea is the best in town and the shave ice comes shortly after
sure its not the most upscale place but i always have a good time when i go
all the meat was high quality and well marinated
we were seated right between the two which may have amplified the noise
im a big fan of the location the crowd and the bartenders are cute to boot
we took jeffs recommendation and was not disappointed
our next trip will be through t3 so i look forward to checking out the other location as well
outside patio with beer pong shrimp and grits that you will die over cool atmosphere
das erste mal war ich dort wegen dem schnitzeltag ok das schnitzel gehrt zwar nicht zu den grssten in stuttgart und es war vielleicht etwas trocken aber es war ein schnitzel
we would definitely return and try other items
the weather was beautiful out and being able to bring in our own water and snacks was a huge plus
the promoter who hooked us up was amazing and went out of their way to make sure we had the best of everything
she always made sure that we were comfortable and all our dining needs were met
i came here for the first time for breakfast
i couldnt believe it
i feel more strange at the bikini which i love too
lots of wire jumping and feats of onehanded strength that will amaze every minute
tyber creek is an awesome neighborhood pub
the beer appeared to be well looked after and tasted great and wasnt too expensive
its mainly because of their daily specials on drinks their amazing happy hour and i like to be iiiirissshhh pronounced arrrrggghhhrissshh
several tvs to watch game
others at the table were sippin on disaronno overall classy night
this would be your classic college type hang out
otherwise stay away
other than that id highly recommend for grabbing a drink when a friend is in town or before a game baseball football since its so close to the stadiums
the greatest place in town for st pattys day
i get the always innovating philosophy but ive found most of the things we had at ecco vino in august are no longer on the menu
the food presentation and service are impeccablebut lost me a star due to no choice other than the prefixed menu which starting cost was 125
they did just open so i will give them another try to get it right
my wife and i tried nearly all of the taco selections all worth it
highly knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations for us
the restaurant is very dark lots of dark wood the bar is like a piece of tree trunk the waitstaff does not seem to have any sense of style although i have to say everyone was very very nice but the point is that it is not what you expect once you have been to the more stylish chic restaurant in miami beach
plastic silverware cups  plates
oysters were big nicely chilled and fresh to the death
not only did our food come really late we only got half of it
he was friendly and took good care of us
the food was fantastic
we came here to enjoy our friends birthday and was greeted by fun hosts
for the main courses our table ordered the chicken rollatini parmesan the burrata agnolotti and the lobster milanese
the waitress had a great personality but service was average at best
i also noticed that they have shuttle service to and from mgm so that was nice
awesome place to go to go here youll love it its a bar its fun its cheap
were it not for the fairly loud conversations of other customers
the beer selection is stellar and happy hour half off taps and apps is from 57 i got the hummus and pita which was plentiful and flavorful
waren mal essen in der arche in stuttgart das essen war in ordnung aber ins sachen service knnten sie noch etwas zulegen war nicht immer freundlich
i totally recommend you try to come to this bar if youd like to get a top knotch cocktail
we met tiny who helps run the place and he was very friendly
a great place for a date or to enjoy with a group of friends
all those who were drinking really enjoyed their champagne and various mule concoctions and we got a kick out of the water glasses made from recycled wine bottles
i mean it was so strong that i couldnt even finish my dish and i didnt even bother eating my leftovers and im the leftovers queen
we even suggested to the server that she try it because she didnt seem to believe us maybe because we ate half lol but she declined politely because she is gluten intolerant she did say that she would let the kitchen know
i got the tacos they were tasty but needed a lil more spice maybe some kind of hot salsa on the side
there are also the complimentary chips and dip
how anyone could rate this pizza higher than a 2 star on here is beyond me
i could eat a whole bowl of just that sauce
this place is disappointing
ravioli di bello  i highly recommend
price is a little high but not terrible
the pink lemonade mayo pairs great too
i pointed this out to her and she said that the price of the dish had gone up to 9 still with the 50 discount but the menu that was brought to us didnt reflect this yet
the cream sauce was way to thick and lacked seasoning
i was silently upset by this because how could nachos without cheese be good
thanks to yelp seats we got tickets for half price
we all ordered steak which all came out at perfect temperatures
i even had to remind the fries order to the waitress i could have gone myself at the counter to get my fries
the special that reels us in time and time again is the 2 coronas before sunset
and the amc theaters drinks are even more expensive
nightlife club atmosphere with charlottes and ncs best djs rated and award winning on wedding website the knotcheck
since i had put we were celebrating my fiances birthday on our reservation our table had birthday decor and a hand written card thanking us for celebrating with them
my goto spot for wings and beer after raptors games
the establishment does nothing about the cacophony and behavior of these teenagers
great for a special occasion
she  didnt seem to interested in making suggestions for dinner and didnt say a thing about the fact that i did not touch my sophia loren  a really strong drink i had ordered
cannot wait to return and bring our family and friends
great ribs and steak experienced in a wild west setting served by a wonderfully warm and helpful waitress
but i refused and advised him that i will take my money elsewhere and wait for my date in my car in the air conditioner
made great wine recommendations and was very personable
there was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio and i could not help but want to scarf it down
blues is one of my favorite genres of live music and i think thats mostly if not exclusively what they book to perform here
personally it made me feel a little uncomfortable as though there might have been a menu on the table for pictures and prices for a half hour in the champagne room
dont waste your time and money here
i am mad it took me this long to finally go here
i dunno just cuz lax is the birthday spot for celebs doesnt make it more appealing than it actually is
food was good but service was horrible
the host that was there did not even bother to greet us
my sister got the cajun chicken alfredo which described as not the best thing ive add but also not the worst and wouldnt order it again
which previously looked like something out of trainspotting
i decided to check out some yelp reviews and was surprised to see how much positive feedback there was
the sushi is always presented well and tastes fresh and of great quality
if youre in a rush like me and staying at the monte carlo then yeah its not a bad option at all
save your money unless your just needing to fill your belly
the service was top notch with good recommendations
the cheese plate was huge and delicious
not as many tens as the spearmint rhino but less pamela anderson wannabe attitude as well
all of it was bland overpriced and just really not worth the time and effort to go there
5 stars for the cider alone
great food super service
ich knnte noch seitenweise ber das essen schreiben aber ich denke das wrde den rahmen sprengen
we waited at our table for our meals while four other tables near us received their food finished their meal and paid and left the restaurant
i then ordered nachos while finally bowling and had the ends of the green onions with roots growing out of them mixed into my nachos
the daughter was working so she could afford a field trip for school
great food reasonable lunch prices an awesome ambience and friendly service
this was the best ive had anywhere
they dont tell him how to make it whats in it or what it tastes like only that it is called singapore laksa but they ask him to replicate it using just the picture and the name of the dish
the service is very slowly
thank you monsterland
the faucet was inoperable one of the bogs was out of order wrapped in a black bin liner dripping into a cleaning bucket underneath i guess it was the most modest one they could find  just for that id mark it zero back at my lane uh table  which clearly had his own mind or a serious relationship problem with the wall it was supposed to lean against and the missus arrived and we decided that this table was a bit of a jacky treehorn he treats objects like women man
the pizza is amazing  i had the sausage and mushroom
i must admit though the one barman had this annoying obsession with the candles on the tables in the back room
i will start with the only great thingthe wine
hard to make a fatty bacon burger pink and dry
order it medium rare i say
he was ridiculously entertaining and made my night
the bar is either dead or crowded
if you are heading over and have a big group then i suggest a reservation
ive already sent groupon on email
a trip to the brat haus is like taking a trip to the old world and never leaving scottsdale
we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving so that was fine they were busy
customer service was great
we didnt order anything from the menu because we had just had brunch but some items on the menu did sound appetizing
they also have lots of great beers on tap which they switch out regularly
i really have been enjoying bourbon and i like my drinks more on the sour side rather than sweet
bowls to drink from
we would definitely recommend this place and go again
oh and the coffee was hot plentiful and strong
i immediately called my contact to let her know we were outside the club
she lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while so after a few hours of daydrinking we hit the spot
baked beans were good as well
the bartenders owner and other staff are always friendly
they did bring us extra bread at our request
dont come here
most of them are very attentive to your needs and very accommodating
when its just a couple ppl i like sitting at the bar but the tables they have are great for groups
i tried 33 coase dinner
i used to frequent this bar mainly for the live music offerings but since have only come here for large group gatherings
food was average
location is a little out of the way as it is basically in a basement in downtown champaign
i went to insomnia twice this weekend
for appetizers i had the plantain avocado spring rolls 8 and the pimento wood smoked mussels
our server gave this answer to our pleas for our food with a straight face  apparently at this restaurant its ok for staffers to be late drunk and provide bad service if there is a beer garden andor absolut tent within 10 blocks
i saw the reviews for the tacos here and they were all or mostly all of them were good to very good
it was the best ive ever had my husband agreed
we have never had a bad experience and the food is always amazing
the seminar opened with the panels background
i usually get spice level 7 or 8 but thats because i require hot ass food
im very impressed by the rock  roll bar  grill owned by the count
our server was great and quick to answer or find the answer to all questions we had regarding the menu
not a creamy sauce but liquidy with tons of cucumber chunks the onion rings are worth a try and they have a nice horseradish ranch sauce
it is worth it
my friends go to the free buffet most fridays after classes so i joined them
its cozy cute reasonably priced full of good food and has a whole slew of games to choose from
to share we ordered the fungi pizza in my opinion wasnt too heavy on the olive oil which i appreciate
only a few people were up there because it felt like we were sitting at a bar on mercury until the sun went down behind ceasars
if youre in the mood for a cozy dimly lit dive bar the yukon is the place to go
early morning breakfastinside mgmcasual bar  diner open quite earlybrowsing breakfast menu and wanting simpleavenue scramble and cup of coffeeselfserve thermal carafe of coffee providedhot iron skillet of a meal serveddollop of sour cream on topeggs and sausage mixed insidebed of hash on the bottomfinding the eggs overcooked very hard and dryoverwhelming sweetness from the sausageside of toast well toasted with choice of jams and honeysip of coffee and eating sweet egg scramble27 after tax and tip
if you know me you know this for sure  but in the nice and friendly i just want whats best for you way
but before o even noticed he promptly brought me some
the times ive gone here are kinda on the fence
i did get a soup with it which came out earlier  it was the size of a teacup
very difficult to decide
that really woke it up
if you like garlic like i do then beware
not recommended at all
this item is also a cheesecake factory dish but didnt say on the menu it was from the cheesecake factory
also the bottomless mimosas are more than most entrees on the menu at a staggering 2499
it all was great
however even though she could see the difference i dont believe he would admit it
thanks thanks a lot
the decor inside is nothing special but upon close inspection you will find echoes of the historic grocery that inhabited the structure in years past
the strip mall doesnt look promising but once you get inside the restaurant its a different world
i would have preferred the bread a little more saturated with the french toast soak but the other ingredients were so good i was totally on board
for the prices they charge they shouldnt be so cheap
id try them
please dont be the pirates and have a pierogie race every five minutes
go to a corner bar or two bucks if youre trying to get loaded
not sure if they do the world beer stamp card from the show
i had a decaf americano and it was maybe the best coffee ive ever had
great choices for normal folks and vegans
the food was delicious i got the teriyaki steak which was great
great idea for a quick healthy smoothie or fresh cocktail
want to watch a flick while waiting for your crew
the bartender seemed mildly busy with a half full bar too
went out and when i got back they were right there in my room
we ordered a mojito which was gross  watered down to the max  coming from me that means its very little alcohol
we were greeted at the door and our waitress for very attentive
i would recommend this place just remember to be assertive when you need something from the staff
they hypocritically ask you whether you are staying or taking the food out however
the sausage is a bit sweet but still very good
the main reason i go every time is the mango lobster rolls you wont find these any where else but here
that could be the nature of buckwheat im not sure
this is our go to spot
this place always remembers me every time i come here rita the best waitress by the way
my boyfriend had the chicken club sandwich and i had the blt which were both amazing
ambiance i love the open kitchen
so i decided to go and have dinner
my dinner mates a strapping teenager accustomed to eating just about anything and a grown man with a healthy appetite after working all afternoon on a farm exhibited no interest in that dish and ultimately we sent that plate back
just ask them to put the balsamic on the side sometimes they can lay it on pretty thick
the restaurant is dated in very tacky oceanic decor reminiscent of the 80s along with a taxidermy alligator if i recall correctly
it could go down to 2 stars or it could go up to 4 stars
we both loved it and cleaned the plate
whats worse is that 2 staff members walked past us without saying a thing while making an effort to not make eye contact
i may have to reevaluate that ranking
id give this a pass during the day
for over 10 i got fried eggs and a socalled hash which was nothing more than fried cut up potato with microscopically diced sausagebacononion
ambiance is perfect
we exchanged cards with eachother near the end of the evening
however pains au chocolat almond croissants are ok much more crusty and tasty and rose water croissants are original
we ordered their last 2 bottles of the 2004 boroli barolo which the sommelier delivered and decanted beautifully
the decor is gorgeus and space and staff unpretentiousunlike a spot next door lets call it  shmactus shlub
it was delicious
i was not sooo lucky
that not only describes sydney after dark but also current strip shows like fantasy x burlesque and crazy girls
the waiter started off a little unfriendly but he got better as we moved on through dinner
has awesome music just an all around fun place to be
very nice decor
it was dry
they have it all including a dark speakeasy feel
id go back for the atmosphere but i hope they get their staff sorted out
buffalo quesadilla  very good
my tea was kind of lukewarm and while they were technically loose leaf at one stage they were loose leaf poured into a bag and put in the pot
fyi this is not based on an employment issue
i wish i had known this before ordering a drink as we ended up finishing them off quickly to get back to our spot
all in all i was a great experience and id definitely recommend it
and beer of course
i changed my second order of salmon cakes to calamari
the menu also has wings various appetizers salads pizzas and sandwiches
overall we had a blast and we will definitely stop here every time we go to mill avenue
between sassi and very few other restaurants in az that i wont plug now the bar is set so high
a bonus the nights experience might help me develop new antibodies for the next superbug to come along
you will be blown away by the beauty and size of the club
im not one to easily give an eatery 5 star but barroco deserves every single star from me
alors la facture monte rapidement si on veut explorer le menu
check ta for the negative issues the guests had to deal with
you can seek the kitchen as they place items up for the various tables
and when the sun sets if i have my druthers you will find my happy ass in a dive bar drinking irish whiskey on the rocks and listening to some metal band shredding on their guitar
good service too
we got there around 1130pm when they still had drinks for 350 but beware the second it strikes midnight it jumps to 8drink
after a quick glance of the menu two items popped out at me for different reasons
they also dont rip you off with service fees like a certain place downtown coughhobcough does
dont settle for a bad table
i also tasted the steak fajitas
if youre not feeling a burger they have salads unbeef sandwiches and even sausages
but the food is very flavorful
i got a piece of dark chocolate and macadamia and bf had milk chocolate and coffee cookie they were all yummy
it is pleasant inside and has a cool bistrobar type of vibe
it is really convenient to the incline
i think the overall experience is where they win out
came here with a friend for happy hour and couldnt have found a better place
3 they charge extra for some silly stuff
i will make a long story shortyea i know too late
the pool was sooo small it looked like a baby pool
the burger there was slightly better there to me
he was so personable and described anything and everything on the menu that would have eaten anything he described
cashew chicken i wasnt quite sure why it looked so orange
before i knew it he started threatening me to beat me up cause he said he was from the streets and thats how he handles things
itd also probably fall closer to two stars taking the food and service into account
i had the wiskey peppercorn sauce steak with steamed vegetables and salad it was very tasty
for entrees my seatmate she sat next to me had the applebees riblet basket and i had the 7 oz house sirloin
on a regular night they charge 20 per hookah for this waste of potential and the menu says they charge 1 per extra coal you want
celebrated husbands birthday here last month and we really enjoyed our experience
i definitely will never be returning here
this is my favorite bar in the whole world
we decided on the carne asada plate with cilantro rice  beans
thats all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard days work
john was the best guy to get
the good the inside is nice and there are a number of large televisions
this isnt really a big deal except the only available seating was a straight bench along a wall so our party of 7 couldnt sit together and couldnt talk to each other
really good place to get breakfast food if youre not looking for a dennys or ihop
they have a huge variety of flavors and its only 1 more for an extra shot its so hard to choose a flavor but the bartenders will be more than happy to let you try samples of them
beyond that is the bar that sits at the end decked with floortoceiling windows offering spectacular views of the vegas strip
i would order the thai margarita again
to start the meal they brought around a variety of bread
but i wouldnt order it again
we had to get the bill corrected
another waterfrontriverfront place that thinks it doesnt have to be good because it attracts business based on its location alone
complements for the cleanliness and appearance of the dining room
the dishes were well prepared and the portions were generous
the prices are reasonable too
i dont like the fact that the lights under those weird desk stay on the entire time
oh well that didnt stop us
nothing more annoying then having to stop eating to more for that along with the dust falling all over us and our food
landed on a friends face
its also worth noting that the bacon cheddar fries are not on the menu
it was ok i should really give it another chance
i loved that the whole sandwich was soft enough to smush down but still held its shape together really well and i didnt have meatballs popping out or sauce ooozing everywhere
this place is amazing
i normally love this dirty little dive bar but today i had the worst service ive ever received here and as a regular i know thats saying a lot
my wife and i had the house salad which we split and its always outstanding
definitely a great addition to downtown dining
this branch hasnt changed much the menu and styling remain almost identical
nice gf options which is always good
we have years and years of birthday pictures from benihana
it was great as well to be able to bring in our own bottle of wine and champagne to accompany dinner
da wundert mich nicht dass mehrere eintrge davon sprechen es sei dort hufig schwach besucht
the onion soup was too salty the cabbage  corned beef had a very strong mustard taste to it  the buttermilk chicken was dry
i actually have never even seen the show but i love the idea of the sodas and that they started making them in their home before making it big
it was outstanding in presentation flavor and grade a
egg  omelet station made to order eggs and omelets
not a place to hang all night stop in a grab a beer before hitting other places on ellsworth
my biggest complaint was the food
i guess there are many screens which if you like watching sports might be good
hb has a cool brewery ambience and lots of people looking to have a great time
wings were subpar
i even saw her washing drinking glasses now that is one humble lady
i mean the person that brings you into their home welcomes you and makes you feel like a part of something
the waitresses are always nice and the food is good
you gave the server your name and every drink was rung up separately so you could have a party and everyone pay their own way however they liked
if i were waka i wouldnt be too happy since they advertise the crap out of bentleys to everyone and i am sure wakas people bring in a ton of their weekly earnings now its not really fun any more
their garlic bread however gets 2 thumbs down
no nono no oooo nooo
the story is captivating and the dancing fighting and acrobatics gave me chills throughout the show
bhs just doesnt care
a taste of the risotto could have been an entree at a more pennypinching place
this is his respond when i say i would like to have a regular two seat table
extensively stocked bar
how ridiculous that in 2016 in las vegas of all places because i have a penis i am not allowed to enjoy this freedom of expression and dance around a metal pole that has been deemed only appropriate for women
i wish i could give this less than 1 star it deserves  a 5  epic fail
wish the mac was a bit cheesier but it was still good
a definite 5 star location
will definitely be back soon
we came here for dinner on our first night in charlotte nc
service is topnotch
i dont think there will be a third
i was staying at the sheraton in cuyahoga falls and decided to meet a childhood friend here
i love what they have done with the place
they should put a rug underneath it so its not so loud when it falls
today with thug kitchen it was a special treat and my meat eating sister gave it her two thumbs up
the sausage were to die for and their kobe beef meat balls are also fantastic
a beautiful 5 star hotel with exceptional service and attention to details
best strip mall parking lot wine bar in phoenix
it was just one of those places where i wish we had decided to have lunch somewhere else
i would recommend this to anyone
we sat there while numerous employees were inches from us interacting with every other customer in the place but not a single server made eye contact with us offered us water said be right with you or acknowledged that we existed
as the name says its a true taphouse
go with friends get a table near the bar and avoid eye contact with strangerscause this place has 1 pound drinks
my husband and i started with drinks
the half shelled oysters are amazing
my grandmother is 79 my nephew is 5 we had all ages in between and everyone had a blast
after about 45 mins of yelling at 4 different people we were slowly allowed to go in 3 people at a time
my wife said her eggs sausage and potato disks were ok but her toast was burnt
brunch was delicious and the server was soooo knowledgeable
this is not without change however and many things that make the former location great have simply gone missing
i only had the fish and chips but substituted the chips for salad
nice large venue with a center stage where artist moves to all areas of stage was nice to see artist interacting with each direction
they do have some regulars that come in like every night but thats no problem and a good sign that the place is good considering theres like 6 bars on the whole street
the french fries are solid and the onion rings were even better
housed on the street level floor of the luhrs building with a long architectural history dating back to the 1800s bitter  twisted still seems to continue that beaux arts theme in its decor i love the big long drapes and the thick comfy couches the tall ceiling and dim lighting keep the theme alive
the waitresses are beyond gorgeous and very nice
we came here because we had free passes and were promised free drinks and heard flo rida was performing
would give more stars if i could
it is a family fundraiser so its busy but that doesnt excuse ketchup being on plates given to us for the appetizers or a dirty table with crumbs french fries ketchup straw wrappers etc
i understand they are new and still figuring things out
when we asked our server about it she apologized and said she forgot
order the eggs benny
for starters we got told we could not leave with the bottle
i look forward to visiting again next time im in cenpho
finally save room for dessert
you would have to ask my friends for that kind of covert info
one i wont make again
i would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents
we all ordered something different and we all cleaned our plates
sigh  robbery i swear
i like how light the ciabatta roll was
the third time in approaching the window my buzzer went off
the pork sandwich was dry and small for 1195 price
my hubby and i can do dinner and a movie and be home in time to kiss our boys goodnight
went there on sunday night with my girlfriend and had an awesome time
nobody bothered to help us or let us know what to do
we were reseated but even after that the service and food were really sub par
we got our stuff and moved
i heart postinos
ich hoffe dass den wirt noch die einsicht trifft denn es wre schade wenn dieses ganz ungewhnliche restaurant geschlossen wrde
the food from the caffe next door is great and the bread she makes is outstanding
the staff was very helpful with our order and kept our drinks full and our bellies fuller
the 4th dish is a cheese plate that only has 1 slab of cheese on it
i got married at the kerr cultural center on october 15th
the server recommended the scotch egg and pub chips fries
my immediate reaction to the place is that it reminds me of bars at home dallas
i went here for brunch a few months ago i really enjoyed sitting outside  hanging out with the birds
i love trying the sandwich of the month though
it is exceptionally clean which i value higher than most things
the service is terrible
i was just handed a box containing falafel tzatziki and something else mediterranean with very and i mean very stale pita
two members from our group left earlier and paid in cash
the service not so much
bartender refused to take it and said server would take care of us
ok not ideal but again i guess i can understand
you would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty
but i still had fun however they people i was with did provide some high end bottle service so i guess i am reviewing from a different perspective
we had their tagalog for dessert
two people mentioned how amazing the place was
the service was excruciatingly slow though the supposed  jazz a single piano was okay
ive brought business associates here for quite meals and celebrations
we ordered the caprese which used to be good
i came to visit recently on a weekday for brunch it was my first time and there was bottomless mimosas
i definitely recommend the kobe beef burger
i absolutely love pho and have given this place many tries but le pho is always such a disappointment
overall good food but great beer selection
it was in the very distant past a solid restaurant
so bring an empty stomach or share it
i went on a super crowded tuesday triviakaraoke night and was told it isnt usually so full
a very good choice
mini baked alaska  chocolate mousse and some sort of apple cake i think
this is hands down my favorite market to go to
bartenders are amazing so nice and so good at their craft
the two drinks were free so they basically held my credit card hostage until they could figure out their problems
i liked the guacamole and there are five different types of chips that it came with
the mustard sauce to pour over the chicken was yummy
the outside dining area was very cool
i highly recommend
great staff great drinks great location
it was also room temperature
because the crowd here sure does feel like the bros i know in hb
my friends thought i was crazy for ordering a salad but i sure proved them wrong
the seafood of choice for ceviche was scallops put on corn chip 4 servings with a cheese base and some citrus and scallions
she responded and i ended up with menus
the service was very punctual professional and knowledgeable
i have been attending brunch services at insomnia for almost a decade now
lots of flavor very tasty and the portion is decent
came in with the family this evening for dinner
the dcor was relaxing and homey
for my dinner i had the scallops that were recommended by our waiter and they were great
maybe this style of food is just not for me but i found all the pasties hahah sounds funny plain and tasteless
good stuff on those fronts
its a bit pricey but its a swanky place and considering the fabulous service we received id say its totally worth it
delivery person was friendly and laid back
long wongs at the firehouse has an appeal all its own
yeah the portions are gigantic but the food is just soso and i would rather have excellent food in a smaller portion over a mountain of food that is just really bland i guess
i especially enjoyed the fact that they have staff walking around constantly picking up the props and making sure everything was neat and orderly so that the kids have maximum fun
such a waste
bottom line skip this and head to tribes ale house way north in mokena il
the owner maybe manager
ive seen many people get threatened with violence out of the blue from unstable people
its all about being in and having it and tonight i have both  we are ushered in i avert my eyes careful not to make eye contact but act like i belong here engaged in nonstop conversation with my friend from the moment the bouncer from saugus mass lets us in till i get my ass down on the pricey leather couch only then do i allow myself to scope out the place and laugh to myself that im here at this moment with these people and plan on when its appropriate to make a run for the bathroom break out the blackberry and start sending out messages such as you will never believe this yeah i suck
unfortunately most middle eastern restaurants that i have been to lack in the service department
we both ordered a pasta
i acccidentally came across tapas papa frita while walking around old town with my girlfriend
last time i was in here must have been around 2003 when it was very much an old mans pub which is what we were looking for
my wife and i went for dinner
lesson to be learned here ikea
i loved it on the wings and pizza
the hotel has a retrothe jetsons sort of vibe to it
black pinto or the 3rd kind that is a combo of blackpinto with some onion tomatoes and of course whats that
she didnt know what tequilas they had on hand and my man ordered a long island iced tea she came back and told us they didnt serve iced tea
we asked for more bread and got the same as before
they do not have a kitchen but they welcome you to bring your own take out from anywhere
when ever i go here i leave with leftovers
when they came out they looked unreal
burgers we ordered 2 create your own  1st hamburger fried egg swiss pretzel roll bun avocado and regular toppings
its honestly not that great but its the only place on the mountain
i highly recommend not trying them because i pretty much cried
we visited today and they told us we could order at the bar and sit outside
we went here with a conference group to do trivia
with that being said do not take your families and children here
i tried sunday brunch and went to a wine event here
even the kids were happy and thats not the norm
service was friendly and quick
the cocktails are also excellent
the dance floor is small n aparently the hot gogo dancers will let patrons up on their stages to dance n try to work a stripper poleso instead of setting the mood for sex watching hot dancersyou get inspired to hit the gym after seeing fat chicks that shouldnt be allowed to touch a 10 foot stripper polewith a 10 foot pole
this is the second time ive been here and its been great both times
the fish sliders were super
fries  meh
trip was worth it
if you want safe very white uppity movie viewing  then this place is for you
fantastic food for picky welltraveled eaters
this is now on our list of fine dining spots to hit up again
i might have just been really full from already eating the previous items so wasnt so excited about this
im aware that waygu beef is completely different so its not a fair comparison to carnevino but hey thats my comment
the drink menu was entertaining  i liked how they had several kinds of white russians and they all had themed names
they take your id and put all the info in their ipad which was a little uneasy but its so they can store your membership in their system for life
i had the cheese stuffed burger and it was awesome
yes plenty of tvs to watch the game
i liked how the rooms were very different with pretty views
but the pizza was fine
we were the only customers and that was fine with us
didnt acknowledge the party
overall a great set up with very poor customer service and organization
im pretty sure there is a cap on the number of people but its typically within reason and for us they said that we could bring in as many guests as we wanted
i made sure to clarify that the steak would be pink to red which he acknowledged
the seafood salad was refreshing but the crab bisque truly stood out
had the braised oxtail for an appetizer
at the end of our meal she didnt ask us if we liked the food
in my pictures i will show you the best part of the meal a garnish around the plate of caviar and dried asparagus
i visited vino veritas last friday evening
not the best experience
i dont remember the name of our waitress but she was fantastic
no need to win over customers anymore
if you know charlotte you know the selwyn pub
nowadays the sprawl of vegas has caught up to it and the glamor of driving out to it seems a little less like a road adventure
and my arms
best food ive ever had at a pub
very eclectic audience
the server did her best but it was a no win situation
its a good place for drinks but ive had two meat dishes and one was way too spicy that i couldnt even enjoy my meal
best time to come here for dancing and a pretty large crowd is obviously on the weekend
overall the atmosphere was nice and the servers were good
the food was satisfactory had minor new restaurant problems pork chop overdone and tough but it was tasty
the mahi mahi were the best with the chicken coming in second
omg  the marzen is sooo good   that dark drink that leaves my mouth with a smooth somber after taste
he bounced around from place to place and came over to us
its more for the business crowd i guess because the financial district is just down the street
their dishes are simply uninspiring
i mentioned that cider that was recommended to me and was offered a sample
important parking note uberlyft over or get there early enough to have a backup parking plan if no parking is available at sip coffee  beer house
awesome spot in vegas
i wouldnt even give it one star but as you know yelp makes you give some sort of rating
we were not fans of the negroni but we told our waiter freddy that we didnt like it and he immediately replaced it no charge with a delicious barrel aged bourbon
drinks at this place were disturbingly overpriced
i added a decent amount of cream to make it drinkable and our food arrived
you definitely have to keep in mind that the rudeness is kind of intense and remember to keep a light heart
brittany the waitress was very polite and checked in on us regularly while michaela who brought us our food was very pleasant as well
my wife had the chicken floutas and she loved it
nice little bar with atmoshere and good selection of drinks including some beers on tap
the sashimi sampler was really the highlight
im happy to see your beer temps did not fall too low for too long to separate the ingredients
cant wait to come back
my only complaint was that i didnt get to try the chicken dish that i heard was so delicious but that was my own fault and joes for being so efficient in filling my wine glass
its a waste
these were pretty tasty
their seasonal roles are super interesting and fun to try
so id like to preface my complaints about my meal by saying that i love salt and have always been pretty heavy handed with salt in my own cooking
we did not go to the haunted house so please take that into account
we were in the bar area for 9 minutes and nobody acknowledged us there were 2 tables and about 6 guys drinking  the bar so we walked into the dining area thinking that would be better
each person in my party had a different one  the coffee ice cream cake the cream brulee the chocolate cake and a cheese cake
my buddy and i were in town for a concert and wanted to hit a club one night tao was always a fave but last few times it has suckedanyways the night we picked was kim kardasians bday  whoopty dolol    as a result cover was 75 for guys we said fck that and found an alternative method we got in for free  we had talked to a promoter earlier and he said if you make a dinner reservation you get stamped to get in the club so we made a dinner reservation but at the time of reservation they didnt have a table so we found a server and told them we didnt get stamped she stamped us so we were in right
ive pretty much liked most of the places in noda that ive been to but this place missed the mark
the service was excellent and the food even better
i might try it again but not on
great place to come and kick back and have some drinks
the fried ice cream was much different than the tempura kind you find at japanese joints
i have heard good things about this place before but i was not prepared for how absolutely delicious the food would be
i expected it to be sad and pathetic as salads at wing joints often are but it was really good
so every once in a while you will find a club that not only you like but other yelpers like too do you know how hard it is to please an eclectic group of people all ages all music tastes all crowd types
both meals were amazing and fulfilling burger cooked well and very juicy
there really isnt anything fancy or cool about it
we would love to come back to this restaurant and would highly recommend it
make it a mini food tour
during holidays this place is packed
best tapas anywhere in the valley and my current favorite restaurant in scottsdale
we are so pleased with this place
it was just ok as far as food goes the service i give a i went during rest week and got a great price and good value but as for going and paying full pricei would say i would not go back
service no complaints
i give this place 3 stars because downstairs sucks
im just glad we didnt have to be anywhere anytime soon
mood lighting in the evenings is romantic but a little extremewhen you have to pull out your flashlight app to read your menu or see what youre eating at the dinner table maybe its time to throw in a few more candles
average at best
the waitress was very pleasant and personable
the best trash can brisket nachos
we expected sea food a little better than your local red lobster but didnt find it here
you may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks
i highly suggest trying this place
35 stars the food i cant complain about i guess the overall experience is what brought it down
will be back soon
i paid the 20 entry fee
such a fun bar
plenty of signature drinks to be had
the serving was more than i could eat by myself so i took the rest home
i even specifically asked when i made reservations if it was available that evening   we ordered the full serving courses not the tasting menu portions
i did not want to be rude so i did not say anything but as soon as we were done with the entres i asked to move back to the lounge area which was so relaxing and everyone agreed we shouldve stayed there from the beginning
the food was great
this is by far one of the worst places to eat in charlotte not enough seating food is horrendous service is mediocre the music is so loud you cant hold a conversation and did i say the food was horrendous
its not really spicy  its a sweet korean bbq sauce
this place had all 3 we were in the bar area upstairs and its so cute the bartender was very nice and hospitable
the restaurant design and ambiance is cool
so he brings out the martini glass that has a heap of cotton candy in it and waited so i could record the whole process of him pouring the drink in to make the concoction so nice of him to do that
the corn wasnt all that special and the kimchi fries could have used more actual kimchi and the fries were kind of burned and there were lots of small pieces so it wasnt as easy to eat
tell the guy at the door and theyll let you right in
just an fyi not all of us were drunk but maybe we were hmmmmmmmmm
jim jon aaron you guys are doing it right
glad to find it
the mashed potatoes were good
i laughed out loud said no and left
the place is arranged to be open with a middle easter n bazaar atmosphere with cushioned benches and booths
expect to play around 10 bucks for a beercocktail
try the coffee bbq sauce at every table right next to the ketchup it is todiefor
a few comments on some of the foods chicken wrap is excellent  whiskey chicken is excellent  better with bun then asking for wrap pot pie is great vegetables are great  fried pickles are good to great according to how much seasoning fried green tomatoes as an appetizer not my favorite but my buddy gets them every single time he loves them
the djs make it a really fun spot for a drink or dinner and a the perfect place for a cocktail or two before you hit the club
it irritated me that she handled a hard to handle situation the way that she did
per my recommendation we ordered a pretzel with honey mustard sauce and when it came out we devoured it in 5 min
the server was very apologetic at first but didnt seem to care after that
it was impossible to have a conversation or watch the game because the gemini twin barbie servers wouldnt leave us alone
hahaha  im loving all the negative review
everything here is bar seating
i also ordered a caprese style salad which was super fresh and the serving size was much larger than expected
i work in the service industry and customer service is everything
during my visit last night  my pizza accidentally went to another table
the second thing that really got to me was the wait staff
the surroundings were gorgeous we definitely took a few pics of us entangled in the strands of hanging crystal
additionally profanity could be heard coming from the kitchen
expensive but not worth it factory dining experience not personable and not engaging staff
also calling rockys a gastropub is misleading
this is really irritating me because not only was mine watered down who does that
the bartenders are wonderful they remember what i drink everytime i come in and provide great service
when i got the salad that cost 13 it looked like a side salad
my wife and i went here last night before the jays game as we live next door and wanted something quick
while writing this i still cant believe the manager and how he avoided the whole situation in any case we left and wont be back
the atmosphere here is awesome the food is great and it came out super fast
it took about 15 minutes before someone took our 1st drink order
food is absolutely wonderful
they were heavily seasoned with something like a general seasoning salt but they were delish
i can get 3 for the price of one as compared to one of the pricey clubs on the strip
so if your visiting dont trust your gps
this was the worst experience i had in las vegas
owner said so sorry as we left but no other admission of terrible service
its weird but very entertaining
the overall effect is likely a good 10 lunch in chicago or another city but high by madison standards
if the rest of the food was like the bruschetta the place would be hands down delicious
it was an insane amount of meat and she definitely had leftovers for 12 more meals
my only complaint if any with this dish was it came with 3 toast points
i would have given them 5 stars had he introduced himself though it was josh he remembered me and introduced himself so i revised to 5 stars
hope your experience is better than mine  the place should have been better from what ive been told by nakama fans
the ambiance is very upscale and unique
i stood there for about 5 minutes until they looked up and helped me
each dish is served with either soup or salad and we both chose salad
granted the stew was tasty
why have i waited so long to try this coffeehouse
after a horrid experience moments before at a nearby restaurant it has felt good to relax and enjoy a nice meal here
they have the most out dated system that i have ever experienced and their song selection is somewhat limited
dress code smart of you want to fit in but the staff are much less bothered than the other customers
and also made me realize that for a flashygood show you can never have too many feathers maribou fluff glittery rhinestones and lights
tip if youre calling an uber dont use the main entrance as they make the drivers go to the south end
its definitely a club to check out
cause they are savory and not way sweet like the way most people serve them
business is rebuilding pay for corkage if you must
i started with the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing
visiting north carolina from new york and stopped into carrburritos for a little mexican cuisine with my friend as per her recommendation
it doesnt take long for you to start feeling pain in your knees and hips
the rice on the tuna was eh
i ordered the funghi burger which was really delicious
id recommend this to everyone
everything works out so great when you combine their amazing sheesha with their top notch food and impressive service
very cool venue you will notice as soon as you walk in
only down side is the bar doesnt serve vevue or patron caf xoxo
market city cafe which was located next to dragon noodle decided it was time for much more than a facelifta name change too
the service was great
this place kind of never hits the spot for me and the food is always just ok
i always enjoy dinner at olive garden and this location is one of the best i have been
the water gets pretty cloudy who knows what happens in there
during ball games all the tvs are on the games and the place is rocking
also had the corn on the cob which was good
blue crabs we ordered did not have a lot of meat but still got charged full price
it was kinda ridiculous
i cannot testify for the entire menu i have 2 favorites that i keep going between
my shredded beef and my husbands red chile beef both tasted like a typical american pot roast
i am going to assume that if you are searching for the top rated dining spot in scottsdale that you abhor chain restaurants and appreciate top shelf niche estabishments whose reason for living is to create something wonderful with each meal
they have a decent beer selection better liquor selection and reasonable prices
either way too much good food in vegas to come here again
like it was awkward how many times we had to point to what we wanted on the menu
its like cheese dip on steroids a queso with chorizo corn relish and pico
there are self serve kegs dart boards and flat screens
die speisekarte umfasst hauptschlich fleischlastiges essenburger steaks etc
the waitress even had the nerve to giggle as she was telling me about the misprint
i will definitely be back
the beans and calamari was cooked perfecto
the only reason i gave it two stars was for the atmosphere
it really gets packed pretty fast so i would recommend getting there early if coming to see a show
i wanted to like this place especially since i luuurve lalbatros and parallax
went there on a friday night before seeing love for a second time
i wasnt  fan of the sauce but he was in another place as he ate his ribs and lumpy mashed potatoes
however the wonderful staff and relaxing ambiance makes up for the nonappetizing entrees
i get that some i look at you laura
i had panfried chicken without realizing it doesnt come with anything else should have ordered sides
its simple and lovely inside and has been around for 5 years its like a little secret and please note  it would like to stay that way in order to keep a crowd of regulars who are calm and kind and friendly
its always nice to find a classy place to unwind away from the strip
not sure what happens in the private dance areas but the dances on the main floor are fairly tame and not too shocking if youre with chicks
i can stay at a much nicer casino for less and be on the strip
this was our first time and we definitely plan to come back
oh yeah there is a bowling alley inside with lanes on both floors
at least they have a great beer selection
the main bar has nothing wrong with it although having another one or two real ales on would suit me personally but the rooms at the back afford the whole place an extra dimension
tldr scroll up and start at the top again you lazy hump
the food was okay better than average bar food not as good as a restaurant thats really trying
took a star for this alone
its worth its all in glory and i recommend you dont change anything about it
the chips and salsa with a margarita are worth the price of admission
as far as performance smheach one is different
it was definitely worth it there were plenty of options that were vegetarian and even vegan friendly
yes including the security guard
2 hot wings i was delighted
she ordered me the house wine that was on happy hour and delicious
we came here after watching zumanity by cirque du soleil
angesagt aber dennoch nettes ambiente
so my boyfriend and i enter and the hostess takes us to a table because there are no booths but it was too cold for me and my bf so she said where ever we would like i sat by the sun for warmth but then i saw a booth became open we moved
very friendly staff
they put warm toasted baguette slices right on top of the brie
hard by the ghost of jj muggs occupying a stretch of dundas just west of the more recentlydeceased sears flagship joey eaton centre is clearly pitched to the tourist crowd
my friend joked that we had all kinds of meat but turkey for thanksgiving
their menu is very limited and all i ever end up ordering is a burger
mind you hubby is not present
absolutely worth a visit though i dont know how often i will be back
orders coming out all over the place and largely incorrect
there was absolutely no line or cover
the popovers are outstanding as are the jalapeno mashed potatoes and the shrimp cocktail but it was down hill from there
i am by no means an aficionado but i have had enough haggis to have sampled offerings that were too dry and tasted like sawdust and on the opposite spectrum too mushy so that it had the consistency of baby food
i loved the steak fajita and the california burrito was also really yummy and unique
i was speechless and amused by his ranting and arm waving
i was excited to check out this place because of their beer selection however i was very disappointed in the atmosphere of the bar
we had a really nice time here
we were privileged to meet the owners before their soft opening and have visited twice already
it is always fresh and has some great topping and greens options
hit the spot
didnt pay for my order and i left
surf  turf slider are really good
the atmosphere is great
the choreography and music was awfulbasically the girls change outfits and dance on poles
tangy pickles fries and gravymy mouth is literally watering right now
l o v e  phx city
my one suggestion even though it was a beautiful evening put the fans on
i have tried many of their brews and they are all quality
the garlic mashed potatoes were amazing
then says because of building the wall
if you come back get the jalapeo dip and leave
the reviews are so mixed i was super hesitant about seeing this show but the price was right as it wasnt as expensive as the other vegas cirque du soleil shows
the chicken was nice and juicy and the waffle was pretty good also
i almost tried cancelling my groupon because of the negative reviewsbut i guess you can say i read through them as not being completely worthy of such negativity
the evening was rather uneventful with little to report
just a nice dinner before a movie perfect place
prices are low they match the quality
the wait staff is terrific its a fun environment if you have not been to this restaurant i strongly recommend it if i lived in phoenix i go every week
however restaurant needs to increase number of employers because when i had my dinner there there was only one waiter who served to table and there was a one guy who filled glass up with beers except chefs
this place is awesome
that and the anticuchos are my favorite things
if the other servers are as good as he was youll never want for anything
we had a cappuccino flan and brazo gitano
the menu had a nice selection of new southern items
i actually look forward to flying out of terminal 4 at phx because i look forward to eating here
ive noticed business types guzzling beers after work pool hounds and women that look like they belong in a scottsdale club
for a bartender to miss that was very strangeeven for the service to not even notice it on the glass
definitely a fun and tasty night
hmmmm this is truely a dive bar
to come through
the service was wonderful and so was the ambience
no one at our table was offered of given refills of their 7up their water their iced tea and i was never asked if i would like a second beer
the level of attractiveness and dancing abilities were super subpar
this time it was amazing
changs but i was wrong
their food lacks any kind of thought
hope this establishment remains clean and nice
this is a weird sushi lounge it has an open space so your right next to some sort of dueling piano bar  live band so if youre not in the mood for live band loud music this place isnt for you
have heard the happy hour is really good and busy but i have not gone for that
for the longest time parasol down was on my to do list
this allstar wings location has so much promise yet is so far from the mark when it comes to making chicken wings
in the bellagio hotel
that likely lessens patronsvicious cycle
we waited a little longer said screw it and finished our meals
everyones voices were spectacular the costumes great and the show had so much energy start to finish
recently i had a very good experience with videographer harold adler of  adler videographyphotography
it was very good n very juicy
its fun sitting at bench seats with a dozen of your friends drinking from glass steins the size of your forearm singing sweet caroline for the seventh time and ive never had a meal that i didnt like
its also freaking huge
service was good
first thing in the door the hostess was not terribly welcoming
the rooms are large modern and absolutely beautiful
there was nothing special about the pizza
the pickles were very good just tasted like regular deep fried pickles with a little kick to them but the poutine was incredible
we also ordered the classic cheeseburger and cup of clam chowder
bus boy named mark was nice and made the experience alright
no service at all
they have a tequila menu that is 6 pages long
theres a million beers here
the garlic fries are soooooo good
we stopped by yesterday and ordered a few drinks
great food and fantastic musicwent in for breakfast enjoyed the meal so much that we returned for dinner and to our surprise we got to listen to a great guitarist while enjoying our dinner of fried chicken
sticking to haze
love this place
we were hungry and i didnt care i was willing to overlook
we arrived maybe around 10 pm and it was dead so empty
what can i say everything about this place is fantastic
but im not one to let one grumpy bartender ruin this places reputation for me
we left money on the table for our beers and walked out
they buy the expensive sports package so you can come here to watch football or a ufc fight  they show just about every big sports event
we were like textbook comedy and of course we sat in the front row
one such act i remember its only been two days at this writing is an asian girl twirling a baton
i dont really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the cornish pasty but i really dont need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i dont need to see all the potential for crosscontamination food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses
really nice atmosphere staff is always super friendly
i didnt realise there were actually so many vodkas in the world
3 the service overall was slow 4  we complained to the manager and he seemed to give an insincere apology and i didnt get the sense that he was even really listening to us
1 to take our order and 2 for the bill
finally a young waiter ventures by and asks if weve been helped yet
we wont be back
the chicken was juicy and the addition of the artichokes and mozzarella was a yummy combo
id call it a glorified mozzarella stick
my group and i were not expecting a 5 star dining experience walking into cabo wabo but what we werent expecting was  to be so dissatisfied before our food even came
i had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes
plus do not forget to use your red card when you playseriouslyi never thought these cards had any major benefits but when you drop a few thousand or a few hundred bucks
in addition to their extensive wine selection they have a decent food menu as well
very impressive for a sports bar i was expecting a smaller selection
it was to include scallops only one shrimp scampi more like the size of salad shrimp and sturgeon i think so but not sure in a weak bland  out of the can tomato sauce
im having a hard time reviewing san tan
when we went to golf the server was no wheee to be found
came back again a month after opening and it seems they still dont have their kinks worked out
over an hour and a half for one piece of food
been here 2x under the name of bar 316 before it was called liaisons
i love this place
i found this place pretty easy to find
the service was dreadful as well so i just ordered a coffee
but i guess i just expected a lot more
am and i needed find a place for diner before going to the sting concert
that was the good part
the stage is so sick especially at night  it really makes the lights and screens pop
tried the fish tacos and they were delicious
i highly recommend it
i think grey goose should have a special of its own since there was so much gray hair
the waitstaff was superfriendly though service was painfully slow
this was a major accomplishment
and since its 24 hours you can always come back later if you didnt have room to eat everything you wanted to order
no open window seating for us
great service the gm there is super cool
the mexican restaurant in the area apparently closed and as the building next to it said tap house in the name i was curious what liquid may flow from the tap
there was live music and the whole place was buzzing
this is not your runofthemill theatre this is a true cinematic experience
best tacos ive ever had in my life period
security was quick ushers helpful and seating comfortable
it came topped with good veggies avocado lettuce red onions and good tomatoes hate the tasteless tomato slices served on most burgers
only other negative is happy hour is only available at the bar or on a couch
i cant wait to try out the rest of the menu
i heard the hostess say there was a wait for the patio so i asked if we could go to the bar
my husband ordered the veggie scramble
i was not in the mood to look up and study them   i had the prosciutto with brie on focaccia with the italian picnic it was the select two  gus had bruschetta and i forget what choices he had  mer had autostrada  well all i can say is i am happy we stopped here
there is only one instruction in this manual and it reads use common sense
are you kidding me
no full drink containers allowedof course  dance the night away at the cave
lux is like being taught physics by sir isaac newton
overall i definitely suggest people to consider purchasing presale tickets online to avoid the bs that you might run in with relying on a club promoter to get you in
the bartenders were nice and helpful and they really seemed to know a lot about each brew
our bartender dan was super helpful with the beer selections and all of the specials that were going on
anyway everybody liked their entree and our server was so nice dealing with our rowdy group
i rant about the lack of glbtq community in vegas so i welcome a place like this
i should mention that this past weekend was memorial day weekend so it can be especially difficult to get into certain events
didnt have a whole lot of taste and was a bit burnt
we had our own server who was quite attentive even as she had to come up the stairs
i did not spend much time in the other side except to use the restroom which is on that side
oyster shooters was amazing in their bloody marys
its beautiful really
you get your hand stamped at the check in then pass through the guards to the elevators take the elevator down to the pool level then trek past the pools
side of broccoli was good but for a burger joint i expected quite a bit more from the namesake entre
we drank a lot before we went because we were expecting it to be like any other day club but when we got there it was the opposite of that
der service ist bemht freundlich zu sein klappt jedoch nicht immer
this no frills cash only bar fits the bill out on the westside
1 sunday funday 2pm few table very slow
im glad they included the fees and everything into the price so that parking was free
we started with the beef carpaccio and tuna carpaccio which is a favorite for us anywhere but here
our biggest disappointment was the mediocre servicealmost snaillike for a relatively empty establishment
our generously sized client group was not an issue
my review will focus on how the bottle service is here
my favorite aspect of the dish was the knotweed which i had not had before
she was the highlight of the evening
dont know why we ordered dessert but the deep fried ice cream was also pretty pathetic
the atmosphere is that of your typical sports bar and the service is just fine
now the food
if youve ever been to and liked java house green room  nirvana then youll probably like this place too
the bartender was friendly patient and gave us good recommendations for beer
i ordered a cup of stilton cheese and cabbage soup for a starter and since they claim their fish and chips are the best in town i had to test their advertising
cons the bar service is terrible
these guys are the real deal when it comes to getting good deals
verdict way better than last time
i really force myself to eat it as i thought i needed to put food in my stomach but i couldnt
in the end  the waitress told the kitchen it was due to a food allergy so they accommodated me which was nice
i cant wait to go back again
we expected they would have good gumbo but it was not satisfying
booze was quickly served which i loved
our waitress sent the manager over and he initially came off as unapologetic and insulted that we were unhappy
i dont usually drink alone at restaurants but i would be totally okay to sip a beer by myself here or even sharing the communal table with a few strangers
only real good thing about hickory is the tvs
ive never seen a wine list so ridiculous in my life
also give the bbq a shot because its solid
excellent service and pristine presentation make the evening a 5 endeavor
in most places the toast is an after that but thats not the case here
if you dont like sweet drinks just look at the drinks special board and pick something else to your liking
thank goodness for this thing called yelp
came here last week after the lakeview
yours tastefully elena johnson
i ordered the pigstrami hash smoke pork butt with potatoes onion kale eggs and lepinja
it took over 20 minutes before anyone took our order and we sat at the table over an hour waiting for our food
my server was attentive but i was never offered a refill
so if you want to try the place out this is an easy way to do it
its easy to notice when someone is putting on airs around you and when someone is being genuine
filet mignon with sides of mushrooms fried rice and broccoli
the environment is cozy and very enjoyable
1lb of the ghost pepper strippers down and done
they have a nice dining area and bar but the lounge  is what caught my eye
when i finally had a chance to sit down at the new champaign location a couple weeks back the quality of the food and the experience lived up to the urbana location
ordered take out 200 worth of 3 lobsters a lb of crab legs 1 shrimp cocktail two bowls of clam chowder and 2 dozen oysters with live wiggling squiggling worms
i just wish wish i could take a picture before i devour all my food
my husbands creme brule custard suffered from being too loose under its hard shell with a more dominant vanilla flavor than we are used to
you can also get a flight of ciders so 3 tasters which are almost the size of a half pint
give it a try you wont be disappointed
four ciders on tap
not good food
the pork belly was a thick cut tender and flavorful and the steamed buns were soft and warm
i blew it on centipede  last time i made it to the boards
she skipped over a couple people when it came to ordering and said i took orders from those who looked at me
i tell her we are finished our meal already and want the garlic bread removed from the bill and get the eye roll
however all the items on the sampler were tasty
we played 4 games and they all had error messages
third course dw trio of desserts featuring red velet cake was good lemonlime pudding with a fresh blueberry a spoonful is not enoughi want more
the atmosphere is cool always a game on and music videos
if previously frozen they were unmarked and had remained long forgotten in some freezer bypassing customary date rotation were just recently discovered and i was served from that thawed and reheated batch that may have gone as far back as the reagan era
we were having adult beverages playing games and having a good time
mississauga natives find this establishment located in streetsville the go to spot for a casual night out with buddies
the only feedback i have is the brick fencing that separates the street peasants from the wealthy and rich made me feel uneasyits very poor and financially unstable looking  it was either that or the girl crying over the microphone playing piano
i even ordered it with an egg on top extra 1 charge with meal and they forgot to put it on
the other night my much better half and i had a burger craving so off we went to the qb
ordered foodwife had salmon and i ordered chicken crispers
basically i had ordered my rocky balboa with my girlfriends beer as i hadnt looked at the beer list yet
their home made sodas are the best
hey your wait is going to be an hour but if you go right across the street there is a postino jr consolation prize
show overleave theatre cross street few flights of stairs and youre on your way home
im surprised they let you bring your own sunscreen in
dieser bereich wird heller gehalten als die restliche location
so there we were
ill be back just to have a heaping bowl of the stuff
great food well constructed drinks efficient and laid back staff
die rote kapelle ist eine sehr nette und freundlich eingerichtete tapas bar direkt am feuersee
upon arrival i was confused about its location
i ordered the bone in pork chop medium well and paired it with the truffle mac  cheese
their is chickentwo good sized pieces shrimp crawfish and andouille sausage
je ny retournerai pas
everyone else loved their food too though other than the eggs benedict and burger both great i dont know what all the others got because my attention was laser focused on the pancakes
i was a big hooters fan but when i moved here everyone said try this place for wings and i did and they are great
atmosphere we had a table towards the back of the restaurant but it did have a pretty good view of the bellagio fountain
my wife accurately described this place as being both the best and worst experiences shes had at a restaurant
want to try everything on the menu
much better steak at jeangeorges stk or del friscos
drinks ran dry and we ran out of sugar for our coffee three times
also an extremely douchey and drunk patron was being extremely loud and belligerent
once finally seated the service was outstanding
i have been to hodges three times now and i would say its hit or miss
the garlic knots are  amazing
loaded nachos were mediocre
make you wanna slap yo mama
do your own questioning elsewhere
how does this place combine style and class with a familylike feel
it had clusters of feta cheese spread over a thin crust and almost nothing else
pepper marinated raw beef  beef carpaccio to perfection
and no one in our group expected this amount of country hickness at this place
i ordered it medium well and it was rare
the food is pretty good ill give them that
would have been more expected at 15 but whatever
the food is very good
it was yummy yummy
i ordered the southern fried chicken that was lightly drizzled with honey served with mashed potatoes biscuit and i added a side of brussel sprouts
he had to take the coupon out of his pocket to inspect it again
if you and i are likeminded the leftover posters from fringe shows are more entertaining to glance at midconversation than the italian football game coming in via the projector screen but  it seems like a good place to set up camp for something like a six nations game
it took around 10 mins to be seated
our server although he was younger was unprofessional
there was definitely a lot of heat from the sriracha and the cajun seasoning was excellent
in a nutshell sucks
definitely hilarious and worth it
decent place to watch sports
food was delicious
ordered the mushroom swiss burger and fries for takeout
however fter a couple of days even though they said they were prepared it was painfully obvious they werent
great atmosphere and great customer service
if your looking for a great meal in a fun atmosphere i would visit wg
i wont be rushing back here any time soon
it was really unique  fresh greens crisp cherry tomatoes
by the time i grab my books and i give myself a look im at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by
its been tough location for several restaurants
i approached the manager and he was useless
if i could give more stars i would
we decided to stick with the classics and ordered the gnocchi with beef ragu and spaghetti pomodoro with a side of broccolini to share
wellsir i do like the sounds of that
i asked the waitress once again after i got her attention if she had made a mistake
the food is always good
four of us had dinner here
our food was very good  id say 4 stars
i was expecting something out of austin powers but felt like i could have been at a bar at a beach in san diego
why you may ask
we were having so much fun
they have great food too
its very nicely designed and very classy looking
the food and flavors are very authentic
our chef started right on the appetizers
the pizza as always was great
plus we can enjoy each others company and spend some quality time chatting with each other
commenting on modern times allen delivered another hilarious line when he joked you know times have changed when a man goes to the drug store and says loudly ill take a box of condoms whispering with his mouth covered  and a pack of cigarettes
again really good
flavorless with burnt cheese on top
the few tables of people at this time of day were all cramped in the same area with one larger family party
they used to give you some bread with it
congrats to 4th street for allowing cleveland police officers to dictate their business
definitely in my top 3
the food here is really good
i have never been treated so badly
sometimes hard to get in and out of as well
in all it was a great show case for my friends first time there
impressed because we are smokers and its not smokey
but this is las vegas after all and expecting not to find crap like this blighting every available space would be like expecting williamsburg free of facial hair and ironic tee shirts
for those who have had this it is heaven
this food just really hit the spot and it was great left over food when i had the munchies
it was amazing
for about another 4 you can add some awesome aguas frescas like the horchata complete with a touch of strawberry
making reservations was a breeze and i was even able to pick the nightclub that i wanted to attend marquee at the cosmopolitan
not only did she not offer some ranch chicken or an apology they couldnt even offer up a side of manners
initial person who greeted us did not ask
cigar selection is outstanding along with their own rolled ones
if you dont mind asking your companion to repeat themselves after every sentence or are good at giving and reading sign language then you shouldnt have a problem
i  need to mention they have tvs so if any are wanting to watch a football game of choice they have it playing
the french toast was a close second
no wait on a saturday 7 pm
they compt the 2 beers and we left
they honestly thought i was going to pay 3 for that little thing
honestly though im not really into the club scene anymore
food service and wine list were all good  salad bar was good too
this is place is great
i ended up getting your basic pina colada which had just the right amount of booze in it
the bonein probably gave it extra flavor
we initially came out her for the vietnamese concert and show
so much fun and the history lesson is excellent
directly next to one of the cooks from another restaurant in the galley
we always enjoy their happy hour because they offer great dishes at reduced prices
the sad thing about this place is that on a week day at lunchtime 90 of the people in the dining room mostly locals from offices close by were having the lunch buffet something you can find in ohio or any small town usaville
im looking forward to going back for another fun night and good food
bire blanche tellement hte de la dguster sur la terrasse cette t
we saw more old folks than florida did in 2015
apteka disallows this
love the wynn
the rest of the restaurant seemed very busy
smelled of mold
food was good service was great
you may find yourself looking for the washrooms
dried corn for nice sweet crunch lots of fregula for some chew and weight avocados romaine heirloom plum tomatoes
granted they are renovatiing the dining room where i remember you can have dinner and watch a flamenco show and have free cover to go upstairs to the club
as a restaurant owner i can appreciate all the hard work they do
before i knew it i was being sold something and didnt really have time to process what was happening
ganz knapp an der 50 vorbei
the atmosphere is somewhere inbetween an industrial brewery and a cosy steak house
oh  parking was free
im not entirely sure why as this makes an awkward eating experience
ive never been here before ill be back for sure
i love this place and brought a lot of my friends for the fish fry
however once we got rolling it was fine
my most recent trip was this weekend
overall joes portions are sizable and their prices are very reasonable for the quality of food
overall a very nice meal but getting on the pricier side 35 per meal
had a nice brunch on a sunday at this cute little houseturned restaurant on larchmere
the margaritas are the best i have ever had whether its the house a seasonal or a flavor they taste great
good quality is good
the food is fine
everytime i visit vegas  i have to come here
great view and awesome service
1299 for the lamb shawarma i dont mind but u get reemed on the can of coke that is 250 yes a can not a fountain drink that is what made me mad
so id say the majority of my experiences here have been for beer n apps
seriously if you want a good steak and a great cocktail then you should check this place out
by far one of my favorite places lots of local music and great people
im not a fan of whiskey or bourbon bbq sauce and that was the only option
great service and fresh food
it will cost you 20 a song and is definitely worth it
the food is simple yet elegant
there were five onion rings far from a side
this place was a short walk from my hotel and im glad it was
ive been here 4 or 5 times and every time the food is fantastic the service even better
but i almost made an exception last night
ill be back next chance i get
the reservation was for 930pm and unfortunately that meant the entire time we were eating we were being rushed by our waitress
then to lax where upon entry i still had a reuseable bottle attached to by purse
ive visited on multiple occasions and have yet to have one negative event
when it came time to pay up she didnt mess up
ruined my birthday thanks senor frogs
i call downstairs again and am told that security would be up shortly
good bruch very extensive
the food was delicious
love myself some babes
it was great to have some seating to put your bags and jackets on but i wished for more
we ended up needing two refills of crackers
she was nothing like any other time we have come we always get a table to reserve and we were so bored that we counted back our trips there to this club and we were in aw because we have always had a 5 star good time always bringing our friends to join us for the fun and weekend stays in vegaswe arrived at midnight and by 115 we had reached our minimum purchase amount so we could leave but the night was over and too late to go to another club let alone this is our favorite spotdrinks were great and the hostess was awesome like always she is very knowledgeable and friendly always making eye contact with everyoneagain this review is for the blond dj that they had that nightmanagement please do something
too bad they were all 1 bills or i wouldve made banks
worst customer service ive ever had in my life and ive never felt so disrespected in my life
i did not for two reasons
but i had the absolute worst horrific taunting harassing service
or the owner who comes outside sits down lights a cigarette and doesnt take one goddamn puff of it not one
my sons pasta bravo was excellent
casual place friendly staff and great food
me the boyfriend and our double dates
the staff was very friendly and pretty chill which made for a pretty chill environment
she comes around to the tables on the weekends and dances with the customers
we were in a group of at least 30 and they didnt show us any love with a discount or anything
the woman who seated us was nice and pleasant
the food was fresh and delicious with many options available
everyone had a good time
and cooked it in a ball shape that had a bit of a paste texture
cant wait to go back
it lasted long as hell and the coals only had to be switched oncewe were there for well over 2 hours might i add
the sound and lighting system was likely improved and provided a clean but not overwhelming experience during the show
we really enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant and everyone is made to feel at  home as soon as you walk through the doors
we have stumbled upon duck and decanter
when the service is faster people will drink more
nothing like getting lobster salad scallop foie gras halibut and dessert in one continual  setting
cue the weird mojito commerical guy
we told him what we were ordering for our meal as well as our price range and he brought the perfect wine for our meal
i had the flat iron steak with eggs and home fries
cool vibe great characters just a fun hotel to stay when in vegas
i didnt want to come here at first because i knew it was going to be expensive 40 per person and i wasnt sure how much fun i was going to have throwing an axe
its definitely going to be a spot of mine for a while
we said yes
the price was listed 8 but she gave me a choice of a 6oz or 9 oz pour
not bad though i dont seem to spend much here
i only ordered a zombie and my goodness was it a strong one
patio  this is why i give them a
i have been missing out i will be back
theyve way upped their menu game too its not just divey bar food anymore
so we delayed our lunch time and sauntered in around 2pm
the performance was amazing and was sort of a variety type show
they have an outdoor dance area nice lighting couches to lounge on even if you didnt get bottle service you are allowed to sit
the second time he rolled his eyes was when we asked to split the check
its a pintxo place so its all about the small dishes
i was feeling indulgent and got it with the fries which were cooked perfectly but tried some of the grilled vegetables from another plate at my table and wish i had chosen them
still stay away
while serving on jury duty i decided to take in some big city eats
great food and drinks and the nicest people to work with
the music was not too loud or annoying
and there were 4 of us guys which didnt seem to be a problem though they did let in a huge group of ladies ahead of us
the chips salsa guac and queso are always fantastic
but the exhaustion i felt sunday as well as my scratchy voice and smokescented hair were so worth it for four funfilled hours at dinos
they offer such great food specials that cant be beat
looking out the window we got to watch a drunkhigh gentleman purusing the parking lot and then when we left we were confronted by a man who wanted to ask us questions and when we refused he started swearing dropping the fbomb and being obnoxious
but everything else is less than you desired
we were seated for much too long of a time without anybody speaking to us or asking us for our drink orders which i was disappointed in i had heard wonderful things from friends about this place and i didnt want it to leave a bad taste in my mouth
once i got there we were seated immediately outside near the heaters as it was very cold outside
give them a try at least  as i do feel they at least deserve a fair chance
small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone breaks the seal
we arrived in a super glam party bus were greeted at the door with no wait in line and were escorted through the club to the back room where all the male goodness awaited us
the delivery guy kirk i think was very professional and was a speedy driver
if you like your cocktails sour like i do then this is the drink for you
next time ill order something else and maybe it will deliver as i expect
food is delicious  ive enjoyed anything i have tries so far and look forward to going again soon
i proceeded home 5 minutes away and immediately sat down to enjoy my first dinner at wing nutz
ive had dozens of cocktails here and every single one was fantastic
i almost flashed the whole restaurant getting into and coming out of the booth and it felt like the bench was molesting me on my way out
ordered 4 drinks 27 total for all
basically the food is pretty good but the smoky atmosphere makes it not pleasant to go to very often
the other folks at the bar were also enjoying themselves and commented this was the rule not the exception
navigating steakhouse menus are always an interesting challenge for the nonred meat eater  i always opt for a seafood entree these days
ive had the chance to try several dishes at the avenue club and bubble up bar and everything has been excellent
after 50 mins our table was ready
i love their cocktails
real good authentic mexican food is not limited to tacos
who wants to go back there in the morning for coffee on yesterdays sticky floors
i watched halfdressed women walk around like animated characters in a really classy and sexy way
wow thats quite a mark up for carbonated water
referring to the foccaccia  and leaves
as for their beers the only one i can get really excited about is the scotch ale i really wish it were permanent
one had a garlic flavor that was amazing
someone at our table spilled his drink and when we asked for a towel or napkins she completely blew us off
we ordered papaya salad chicken pad thai and the famous garlic prawns
definitely made the day a blast and kept the girls entertained
they bring your check in these cool vintage cabbage pack kid books
hefs is the place to be
im not really sure why it takes so long to dispense premade slush from a machine or to shove in a few shots of alcohol
stopped in here on a late friday afternoon to check it out
our club met at iron works  and it was fabulous
the staff was kind and attentive
oh did i mention that my perfectly cooked juicy 12 lb burger was only 500 during happy hour at 1030pm
the largest floor played all that technotrancehouse crap music with no lyrics and a relentlessly annoying beat that made me feel like i was trying to dance inside a crackaddicts head
but theres still a novelty to seeing jimi hendrix hot pants combined with a hihat used by styx that makes it an appealing choice once in a while
i just wanted a bloody mary so i wasnt really sure what to expect as far as their brunch menu
we loved it
excellent service always
first off the desserts alone are worth the trip to firebirds they are absolutely amazing
il tait trs surpris car videmment personne ne la avis lorsque nous avions demand de lui parler en personne  23 employs
if youre lucky you may find street parking
stopped in twice one time they had their soft opening with a limited menu and the second time they didnt have a happy hour menu established yet
bar is nice and the drink prices are reasonable
the burgers seem to be the most fairly priced menu items from a you get what you pay for perspective
the menus have real leather covers and the food sounded delicious
they change their barrels and taps regularly so go with an aim to try something new
ever imaged an oasis in the las vegas desert
they also have some good beers on tap if you prefer that
nothing turns the heads of everyone in a casino including pit bosses like parading  a dozen hot tattooed girls in evening dresses and one big drag queen through the floor on the way to the club
take your money and eat somewhere outside of the vegas strip for about half the price but get the same enjoyment if you do your research of course
we have regular amstel
my hubby and l ate here today and while we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food it is the long weekend in may and our server liana definitely made up for the inconvenience by being attentive and whatever the word is for charming im supposed to use for women
so how does wildfish seafood grille justify charging 20 more during restaurant week which is supposed to be more of a deal
now this may sounds fussy but a grilled cheese should be a hot sandwhich the cheese should be melted and the bread toastedgrilled and that was not the case
the deserts are also some of the best ive had in the city period
we didnt touch our food
i didnt try the spicy sauce but i loved the little container it was held in
this place is sooo cute
wish this place was round the corner from my place id be a regular
the food was alright though a little heavy on sauces  dips
so it holds good memories for me  i found it to a fun little spot
this review is for the customer service desk for the hotel they where so helpful and compassionate
the braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience and the schnitzels are very delicious as well
congrats capital grill as i wouldnt have wanted one thing different
we will continue to come here specifically for her
boys dont get the wrong idea
if you love hip hop and top 40 music contact me for any bottle service or vip reservations at 5169872549 for the ultimate nightclub experience
they were to die for
the outfits they wear appear to be modeled after a 14 year old boys fantasy
theres also a mechanical bull controlled by an employee
so lets start with those outstanding dishes crispy duck salad  my hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before
the service was a bit off
but the bartender yelled at our server on the floor in front of guests
bar makes really tasty drinks
we had been in search of dessert anyway
surely quality food and drinks is not what you will pay for
love this place
the old elevator shaft with the glass floor is also very cool
fantastic chicken strips onion rings and fries
i would come here for last resort again but not as my first pick
we ordered margaritas and after 20 minutes i went to the bar to get them
we were just seated and the waitress came by for drinks order  we stated we had not had a chance to look at the specialty cocktail list as yet
he was more than casual
i tried the almond croissant which comes with an almond paste filling
pumpkin paste which had butter orange regans pure de courage gingerbread syrup dry curaao pierre fernrand  couvoisier  matcha misu which was topped with matcha powder and coconut
they are tangy barbeque wings so dont expect buffalo style
well spend hours playing
they experiment with styles feature guest taps and can have a large beer board so you may want to try some samples as the selection will be different the next time you come
if you like to line dance this is the lace for you
its casual but not too casual
it is a small club but thats what i loved about it
i had the kensington brewery beer a watermelon wheat beer which was good but not great
goldwater can be a little pricey
we had to push our dinner reservation an hour and the three girls up front literally talked shit to each other about our group when three of them walked away to get seated
when called the manager to let him know he explained that he was not responsible for the conditions of the patio
highly recommended it
soulpepper is one of those places that reminds me how lucky i am to live in toronto
we are addicted to the chili
the bacon was delicious
tonight again my burger is medium well the fries greasy and dry
my first and last visit to dillons thunderbird  since we are not big meateaters we both ordered tilapia
i might be a cheapskate but the beer is a bit pricey 350 for a pbr  the r word
awesome burgers and very customizable to fit your needs
the pizza ranks as pretty good for east coast standards but damn good for phoenix for sure
isnt that kindof a red flag
for my first time there i enjoyed it very much
the other dish shared was their surf and turf which consisted of a well seasoned fillet minon good 8oz baseball cut on top of a mixture of portabello and spinach accompanied by two shrimp and lobster enchiladas
in such a prime location it definitely needs to be shut down
they food poisoned me i had 6 hours of agonizing pain cold sweats diarrhea and nausea
its not a quality look at all
the outside doesnt look like a nice place but the ambiance inside and staff treated like a great high end place
super trendy restaurant with pretty decent food
the were also notbreaded and pretty tasty yay
being that its just a few minutes south of the strip you dont get that hustle and bustle feel to it but youre still close enough to see the vegas lights
the only time i would say not to go here is when they have the ufc fight on
and the service was to the right level of attentiveness both times
nothing out of ordinary just a regular hookah place with a hot girl workingowning the place
there are so many good places to get a quick bite to eat in vegas i would skip this as a meal place
the waitress assigned to our area was so overwhelmed by a full house that it looked like her brain was going through a short circuit
the less than stellar experience occurred during a wine pairing which the food was not only cold but the wine was late on every course
its too bad bc id like to order from here more often but not any more
a few plates were empty so you can interpret that however you want
anna ordered the escargot which was very good served with plenty of garlicky butter and not served in the shell which made it easier to eat
it also happened to be an edc showcase that night featuring edm djs who are trying to make it
mind you the gentleman i spoke with repeated my requests and assured me of my reservation
the song selection is a bit confusing and disorganized though as a friend of mind waited over an hour to go up while 3 people continually went up
diner on 1 side and a sexy hot lounge on the other
entree 2 fish tacos
true love f o r e v e r
my main dish was the rice platter combo with pork chops and the sauce that came with it is everything
it took us by such shock since we didnt know that shishito peppers could be that spicy
my wife and i had a great time its a must see  best show going thank you ladies for a great night  terry
this is the fault of our waitress by misfiring the order to the kitchen  any good waitperson knows all food for the table should come relatively around the same time
the food is generic italian nothing special the type of food you find in a tourist style restaurant in little italy
we eat here about once a week
karaage  cant go wrong with fried chicken
haberdish has been popping up on my socials for a while now so it piqued my interest
my friends and coworkers have raved about the food though esp the burger
we even wanted to tip just krystal because she was so amazing but they split it all
great hibachi grill
its a very middle class area and im not sure how the prices are a good match for folks who live nearby and dine here
look forward to enjoying more times there when i travel from sd to az
the restaurant itself is very chic and makes you feel like you are at an upscale restaurant in soho
fast forward 6 or 7 trips and i still love this bar
stopped in on my birthday this year a friday night
but anyways back to the dancing the dj rocked or maybe i was drunk off my ass and would dance to anything
she was great and held her own
they are very professional good service big portions you can repeat soup and salad good bread as courtesy
i went  three times with friends in the past month and the food quality has gone down so much since the last time i was there summer 2014
the food isnt amazing basic bar food but it has been improving i would say
if you have trouble making decisions like i do beware that the list of cocktails itself is pretty much two full menu pages with a multitude of delicious sounding drinks
this consisted of asparagus fresh heart of palm avocado tatsoi and crispy garlic citrus soy
i highly recommend their taste of italy prebuilt three course meal with the matched wine tasting
of course my alcohol tolerance level is low
sorry if you love rehab but this was a day after i went to what i consider is a real pool party at the new encore beach club go there and you wont be disappointed
wow factor this is beautiful club luv the body guard that wlkd me 2  from the bathroom 2 my table
the service is excellent and they take very good care of you
i would just appreciate someone to look into this
we werent really sure what to expect well the entire experience was better than i hoped
but as we were ordering we saw some lady come out with a giant bag of popcorn
its a good thing we got there at that time since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6  despite having like 140 beers they carry just one hard cider which i think is a little ridiculous
i waited in line no more than 2 minutes
she gives it a 7 out of 10 my girlfriend had the southwest burger she said it was yummy
overall prices were pretty reasonable
drinks are pretty good the bartenders are always cool and friendly and the crowd is great  has that kind of rocker vibe to it
this entire area of the world is my personal nightmare
the 2 girls seating people are maybe 16 and have no idea what is happening
the bartenders are genuinely brilliant people
i could go on and on but its not worth the effort since the kitchen couldnt make the effort to serve a dinner worthy of the price they charged
seems to me something should have been said
then i went back and had the lunch buffet which was universally panned and despised by yelpers
when we lived in central phoenix before we bought our family home we celebrated our engagement in august of 2013 with the boys at the camelback location
the shake itself tasted like a very basic oreo cookies and cream shake
i didnt hate it but it wasnt great
next was the eggplant
i have to say that the bread is probably the best in town
will go again
my service dog and i made lots of friends next time we are here this is our home away from home living room
bring your oxygen mask
walked out with full meal for two for under 35 with tip
it was bomb diggity
more disappointing than the service was the food which was really underwhelming
he does this sleek trick with throwing the napkins to land perfectly in front of you ready for him to place your drinks on
i wouldnt come here without a voracious appetite
great space hilarious regulars and the best damn caesar you can get for cheap
the rooms are well appointed with a comfortable bed large bathroom and some great tech features
we will be back to check out the patio
to conclude the decor is tacky the service is meh and the food is mediocre at best
shortly after this our food arrived
okay now i am mad
seems like a great idea probably jumped in a bit early
i thought to myself okay lady slow down it sounds like youre compensating but believe it or not i really dont think shes wrong
i know so we called the
the skirt steak was perfectly cooked to medium tender and juicy and had great flavor
of course we were skeptical at first when purchasing but when the night arrived all of our worries were gone
it was a very popular location because we had about a 15 hour wait
the food was tasty but not a great deal
it is also very spacious and smoke free as well
i didnt make a big deal about it but yeah
i looked at the menu for as long as i could stand it and ordered a skillet with coffee
30 for girls and 50 for guys and that does not include anything except for admission
both were excellent
what i love most about tche tche is the atmosphere
i felt like i could have gotten the same quality at a diner for 13 the price
the prices are a little steep 15 for a salad but the food is great and the environment is one in which youll want to linger for hours on end
the four of us all ordered something different my fish was slightly under cooked  so i didnt hardly touch it
they should really fix that
i just got an extra spoon to sample each
it was a little bland
he then ordered a second choice which was on the list
return factor  77
try the beer sampler very fun and educational
if you wanna claim purity make the damn thing with cognac
everyone is very friendly and makes you feel at home
seems like the venue will try anything to see what sticks
the food is amazing simple as that
we had 45 minutes to eat before we went to an appointment at 6 this was a super relaxing place to spend it and we got our food quickly and it was all very tasty
all in all the worst restaurant experience weve had in las vegas
but if you do you should have a good view and a nice time
they have 2bars and the bartenders are giving you a show when you order mix drinks
we finally received our entrees at 746pm or reservation was at 630 which meant we were forced to shovel the food into our mouths
my issue wasnt so much with the food but with the seriously lacking customer service
we had the beef combo was very good
i read about the libertine on blogto and thought it sounded like a cool spot
food was okay for the strip our waiter was pleasant
im won over by the good beer selection though plus all the hipster eye candy
so make sure to order the burger the way you want it
i say gotta have a excellent bed to get a excellent nights sleep and a nicely put together bathroom to enjoy an invigorating shower or leisurely 30 minute relaxing bath
great art great submarine sounds a lot of fun and in great condition
rock n roll country to trash metal and punk rock music way cool laid back chill this is on weekend morning before noon i havent been late at night but i plan to with my homeboy soon to listen to the live music this place offers
looked like lots of great sounding house cocktails and specialty drinks offered as well
winterlicious  appetizer spinach mixed gorgonzola salad with mushrooms  pate with crostini and onion jam
was 5500 for 2kid tacos  burrito burnt out server rest of staff was nice
went here for lunch with some friends that picked the restaurant
ive always had fun at moon in the past
valet parking is 5 starting at 4 pm
im a fairly easy customer working in the industry myself but that point really soured me on the night
just an all around great vibe as well as great food
for us the best ones we tried so far were purple parma which goes great with mustard and big popper cream cheese jalapenos and berry preserves
kimchi fries with bulgogi is a killer
now this particular cousin has travelled all over north america and eaten in restaurants from vancouver bc
when we were about to get seated on a 2 seat table the larger party beside us took the table and joined it with theirs
not a great attitude from our server who seemed to find smiling a difficulty
a lot of places seem to have tasteless chicken but not barrio
i will not recommend this place to any of my friends and family
for us our chorizo chili dog was disappointing chili was too sweet for my preference
getting on the wait list happens in a second line at the concierge desk
its okay to make mistakes but dont insult your customers intelligence by lying to them  not acceptable
d they always make our experience so great
i opted for a 22 oz ribeye without the bone and i must admit that this steak was in the top two of the most delicious steaks i have ever eaten
aussergewhnliche getrnke wie corona extra oder den hausgemachten eistee in mehreren geschmackssorten sowie sehr gute cocktails zu angemessenem preis
thats why im jealous
if not there are plenty of fish in the sea
always love this place when im in the mood for a burger
theyve been here for years ive been coming here on occasion for probably ten years or more
the food was okay small portion size for the  nachos but the taste was good but it took over 20 minutes to come out
we felt like cattle
two edamame didnt quite qualify as making it oriental
also the baja tacos have this delicious sauce
unfortunately the wait staff gave our table away
another 5 min went by and our waiter finally dropped by with some water
otherwise this can turn into a pricey date
the truffle oil was a nice touch but i think the chef needs to review his recipe
they were on a bed of asparagus with a ginger orange sauce
loved all of the toppings nice thin crust
during brunch they have 3 drinks which are all delicious
everything on it was good the service was friendly and consistent
on a busy saturday night i ate here with a few friends
excellent texture almost like eating a butterfish and flavor
the prices are very reasonable and a great find
but way big so share even if its for your meal you can still share
the sushi tasted great as well
40 mins to get food and another 10 to get our check
if youre in the mood for something a bit more guilty try the bbq pulled pork fries
aside from the lack of auditory ambience we enjoyed our 1st ethiopian experience
tickets start from 69 89 109  125  plus tax and service fee per ticket
the place has always been cramped and noisy but i had dinner there often because the food was amazing
better than juans
think ill stick with something a little more mild next time its hard to judge their normal food when i order the spiciest thing on the menu first
the drink she made for my better half though was incredible
the brunch menu was interesting and we had high expectations going in
thank you gordon biersch and matt for the excellent dinners out in arizona
the cigarette smoke alone should tell you this place is low class and not inviting
i had the taco salad
i then asked the hostess if we could have some wipes for our hands to eat our ribs
heres where things started to fizzle a little
in this city sports bars are a dime a dozen
the waitress wouldnt come and check on us and at least apologize for the food taking so long
plus the waterfall is so soothing
they have a modern vintage feel to the place and i absolutely loved it
musicand i like musiceclectic from frank sinatra to indian techno it was all over the board
i forgot her name but she was a shorter pretty brunette she was super nice
i am in restaurants every day
crispy wings with chili garlic parmesan and extra virgin olive oil
every time ive been to soul i always get a sushi roll of some sort
i am all about martinis and a good martini at a low price
the menu looked extensive
i had a great time but no thanks to the bar
the food was outstanding at least from what we ordered carnitas burrito and carnitas tacos3 came out hot and fresh
it went downhill from here
all in all i would say i am very happy with our first experience and my expectation of this place were completely fulfilled
also good was the arctic char and steak
bar staff is cheerful and friendly
der las vegas strip wurde im jahre 2000 wurde zurecht als sehenswrdigkeit zur allamerican road ernannt
overall not the best taco experience ive had i wouldnt go back for them
dont know if ill return
i absolutely love this place and we will definitely be back
the place is a lot bigger than we expected with a seated tableservice area in the front and take out in the back and upstairs
i go for music never tried the food looks good get their early
she was patient and discussed the entire menu with us so we could really enjoy our experience
and yes very friendly staff
adapte  la gnration en question
plenty of shopping and a movie theater in an open are plaza atmosphere
always great to be at eddies
i love the asian pear in it somehow it makes me feel the burger is not as heavy and fruits make it healthier
my mom got herb chicken and it was cooked extremely well
salmon cream was alright but uni would have been better imo
beer is so so  the service is slow and no where to be found
recommend  the halibut any seafood dish ahi  nachos just about  everything  is not going to disappint
for dinner the steaks are actually pretty good
too bad i was really looking forward to the show
never have i have had to add salt to any mexican food i have ever purchased before until now
11 years coming to this location
i kind of regret not getting to try the man candy but that seems to be a hot item
staff is wonderfull and respectfull
though it kinda looks like they are closed from the outside just cause it isnt well lit
i loved the flight i chose as it offered a nice variety of wines both white and red
just order beers
this is the best chain i have ever eaten at for italian food
however if you look at it as a restaurant it loses a bit of its luster
i wish i got that
cheap drinks and very cheap food that is tasty and has just the right amount of spice
there was a band playing outside so the intimacy was pretty much gone at that point but they were pretty good and made the ambience less stuffy
thank you chef chris and staff
had the chicken soup sliders and one of the charcuterie boards
should be removed from this category
it honestly tastes like they took some dirty ass tepid water from lake mead and added a little bit of yeast and hops to it
edm events are known for lights and lasers which this club desperately needs more of for the people in front of the chandelier
i sat down for 25 mins thank god for technology to keep you busy before being approached by someone asking if i had been helped
really fantastic selection of wines
the cocktail menu is overwhelming but the waiter and bartender were very helpful in making recommendations based on your style or preference
some of the dry seasonings are okay but the taste never seems to be consistent so i stick to my one flavour
mind you my family can do much worse but this was not money well spent
i honestly would not change a thing about this place
looked fine but was not served hot but rather warm
its the clam soup with melted butter and loads of tiger shrimp
five minutes later 30 later we were all in
very nice decor
came with a friend today and ordered 2 lattes and the matcha cheesecake
make sure you wear pants so you can ride the bull before dinner
you have to admire that kind of spirit
so thats my review in a tortilla shell
ordered the grilled chicken sandwich
great place to watch a game play some pool darts and cornhole
im glad i finally stopped in and gave it a try
i love sports and getting together with friends to watch them
we ordered a bunch of beer and got their 3 shot combo with it
i had a hotel but yeahoh they had these circus dancing chickslike go go dancers but hanging from a ceiling
the service is always fantastic
after waiting there for 30 minutes i still dont have my key and top golf doesnt know where it is
it arrived without cheese
cool place to eat coming off a boat
granted it wasnt the greatest prime rib ive ever had but it was served quickly and with the kind of attitude that made me feel like my business was truly appreciated
love their awesome array of cocktail goodieness
that was the best part of the meal for me
all were very tasty but the sliders and sandwiches were tad on the greasy side which  now that i think of it is perfect for when you are drinking
they have so many options on their menu its hard to choose so i have to keep coming back to try new things
we came back about 5 after 4 and the place was already filled up we choose bar seating because it was much too hot to eat on the patio
the beer selection is great and there are some unique brews that i know my husband appreciates having so close by and i was incredibly excited to find a selection of mead as well
angel are waitress was super cute and nice and gave wonderful service
ill never understand why downtown las vegas charges for parking but thats one of the reasons we seldom go downtown
if youre getting the tasting menu i suggest u think again
the fries were my favorite type crispy and not flimsy
the vintage home the restaurant is built inside of is cute and homey but the dcor is colorful and modern
not sure if its because its late they were trying to go home but regardless we will never be back
i snuggled into a comfy couch with my cocktail and honestly was so comfortable i didnt want to leave when it was time to sit at my table
generally besides a cure for a hangover i wouldnt be found at this place anymore
i dont mind a rock and roll theme but be consistent
good tacos but for the price could have expected more 2 for 10 bucks
this was a lovely little spot and i cant wait to visit again
i believe i met 2 or 3 younguns and they were super fun
came here for a bachelorette party dinner and we did the tasting menu for about 75 per person with tax and tip in the end
i cant wait to come back
nothing about the food stands out to me
sos the wine even the house
a man came from the back and asked if we had been helped and then the bartender left her customers to come take care of us
the suncoast venue itself is fine i agree that all seats are good even in the back
brunch for two people who each had a beverage was 40 with tip
my mom and i dined here while out shopping on a tuesday night
we got to all have fun with our bachelor while i got to impress the bachelor who thought i had planned everything myself
this place definitely impressed me
wow what an amazing hotel
the service was great we were treated very well and the staff was always on top of it ready to help us as we needed then
after a few more items i went to try the raw oysters
garlicky mofongo with nicely fried pork to go with it
wish there were 4 12 stars
all of that being said i cant give mo lv 5 stars due to the bizarre howlingwhistling sound that is produced when wind travels between the buildings in the city center complex
even though we only ordered 2oz on the wagyu order it was served in a beautifully decorated plate with lots veggie and dipping sauce
i asked and the waiter had an ample answer that the southern italians and especially at home drink it that way  so they serve it that way  good enough
die portionen sind fr us verhltnisse berschaubar fr meinen geschmack aber absolut ausreichend
well in town for the races so we like to support the local businesses well we were recommended to this place and if i could punch out my team mate i would service was horrible took 2 hours to get order and foodappetizers came out with main course so the cheese was glazed over on my nachosnever again
if you like a good steak this is the place to go
i gave who ever that was another five minutes before leaving
the only downfall is the wait
30 minutes lateryes 30 minutes although i called ahead i had to ask one of the ladies behind the togo counter where was my food
there were 2 interesting beers on tap and lots of funny fruity cocktails with geekreferential names
it was the best fried chicken id ever eaten
its always full to the rafters with a great pre club vibe
our server was super rude although the food was delicious
i mean people usually come here for the beer right
it for some reason had not been communicated to the people setting up the table but they did everything they could to let us know they would get us taken care of
they still taste good just really small now
im still working on acquiring the taste for beer
the one dish i would definitely recommend is the chicken tuscan pasta
great atmosphere here younger mixed crowd
this is our go to for a great bite to eat and to stay away from fast food
we also requested for the food to come all at once instead of apps first which they were able to accomodate
i wanted to say something but since i had a visitor i decided not to
the potatoes were barely warm
some places similar dont have directional lighting over the tables but this place does and its nice to be able to see your food and read the menu but also have an old vegas type style to the place
the last few times i have gone i had noticed the wings werent as crispy as they normally were bordering on slimyyuck
i have been to noras at least 40 times already
in response to previous comments yes the drinks may take longer to make but these are quality cocktails not vodka red bulls
thankfully it was free refills so we didnt have to pay to get unrancid tasting drinks
with food and drink specials every night of the week this small dive is worth a swim
there were very comfortable couches tables and a great mai thai
1  calamari  bachi burger has taken this appetizer to a new level
first club id ever gone to in vegas  i had a horrible experience
dont forget about the food its so good will catch you by surprise how good it is
pretty diverse crowd too which surprised me a little
the food here was just ok cuz what do you expect from dive bar food eh
or you can use their huge list to create your own
ask for omar
everything looked delightful
blackfinn please stay as wonderful as you began
i need to make note to stop by sometime and try one of their buildabowl workshops for dinner
if you ever want to party in vegas like rock stars look no further than here
we stopped in here on canada day because omi down the street was closed
one of the most unique flavor combinations ive had in recent memory and i practically licked the plate
cheers ron  esa
good presentation yes
the fried mac and cheese was also super good
i went today for happy hour my friends and i were less than happy
and it has all been so tasty
it only gets the second star because they have good beer
i did enjoy the brussel sprouts  very tasty
they also have some microbrews on tap
one of my favorite restaurants in the north valley
cocktails are very good too and at a reasonable price during happy hours
i would advise against eating there
199 for a cocktail until 3pm
i always love to come here
1 spa was drained every pool had a bunch of debris 1 pool was closed if its windy the water from the waterfall sprays over everyone
45 tropical fruit margarita frozen fruitflavored  margarita mix strawberry  raspberry banana wildberry or mango triple sec and tequila
it apparently was o allowed to just watch however the dancing girls merely walked over to the poll in the slowest motion i had ever seen swayed their hips very very slowly opened there legs at the pace of a turtle and that was it
they then asked me several questions and i answered them correctly
we went here for lunch
we started off the night with drinks
i ordered the french dip and it was good not a whole ton of meat inside the big big bun
they are made by hand and from scratch
if dive bar were in the dictionary it would have a picture of jupes
its almost as if they have a radar to see if your cup is empty
hubby loves the bread pudding
as many reviews have stated the zucchini appetizer was delicious
id rather spend more money on cirque shows
our waitress said they had just hired a new chef a couple of months ago
perfect spot in a slowly developing area that is screaming hipsterville oasis amongst the glorious people watching downtown area
its either a roadhouse that specializes in wine or an upscale winery experience
i will be coming back to try their seafood
their stage has 3 ramps 1 straight through middle and 1 on each side of the stage that stretches out into the audience
service was ok but its dirty
the tacos are bite size
it would be really helpful if the sauce names came with at least a couple word description
he would sure be proud of the christmas spectacle and light show that goes on at the coach house each year during the holidays
great neighborhood place to go for great food and a comfortable atmosphere
my girlfriend and i sit down order an appetizer and a sausage pizza
holy f balls friend and i walked in and walked right back out
its creamy and not like my favorite which is a1
i waited for about 23 min for the bartender to see me because she was talking to patrons
thats enough to keep us happy
the carne asada tacos were my favorite i did not care for the breaded fish but i got a taco replaced without charge which was really really nice the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great
i found a vegetable sticker in my meal and when i brought it up the waitress only apologized
we enjoy it because we can get a great dinner in a somewhat casual setting
what you would expect for vegas
you wont be disappointed if youre looking for a cool tuckedaway place to grab a drink and hang out
sound  i cant say that it was the most amazing place with sound
want more details read below i was very excited about trying out this restaurant
3 glasses of malbec an order of short ribs shoestring fries and shrimp thanks to the chef
we will definitely be back to try more specialty cocktails and sample more of their delicious food
ive eaten here several times
i cant wait for the patio to open
this is the not place to go if you have just 2 12 hours before your flight well in my experience
we were sitting by the window where you could see the food prep
in the past ive seen everything from boyz ii men to john mayer to cinderella on ice
off the beaten path this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience
i guess it helps to have hot girlfriends who were partying it up sin city style
its as if they were trying to fill up space
my first experience with brix was at a private usbg event that they were hosting
dessert was a pistachio souffle
that just ruined the show for me
wait staff is great and very helpful even if something goes a little wrong
definitely check this place out  whether its for taco tuesday or any other day of the week
theres a coffee shop which is nice
after that nothing good can be said
i would give this place a 35 stars wait was tooo long service wasnt too great drinks werent good it got quite smokey in the restaurant the only thing they really had going for them was the food
cole slaw thick potato fries and the meat of your choice on fresh baked italian bread
ok first lets get it straight this is a place for say  55 crowd
like all tex mex it is comfort food and everyone has their own favorite
the staff will take the time to educate you on the beer list or to suggest something new
several visits all aspects top ratewine appetizerssides steak tooo salty on most occasionsone so salty almost unable to eat but took home to save in stew but still so salty just threw out will avoid steak here as lobster etc good
ranging from pasta still being frozen to a steak taking 2 hours to cook coming out to them extremely black
i got the traditional and boneless wing combo with the buffalo chips
i dont mind paying a little more to support a local place but some of the prices are really high and others are quite a bit lower than other places
the ambiance was just what i was looking fordark romantic and modern while not being stuffy and too quiet
again good times
im not the type to limit myself to options but if i had to pick just a few restaurants to eat at for the rest of my life this place would easily make top 5 i freaking love this place
i check the bank account today to find that they processed our bill twice
they used to have the best corned beef and eggs but they have changed their menu
they do offer ear plugs in the rooms but we have never needed them all the times weve stayed
i just took it all in drank a lot and enjoyed the scenery
wont be back
a couple of my girlfriends and i decided to try this trendier restaurant in the old port
it is a must to get a fat tuesday during the summer so i hope you are holding onto the cup right now because there is no stopping you all in vegas
i went to the fox about a week after it opened brought in by a 15 discount coupon
my husband ordered small beers they continued to bring him large beers
i dont understand how the manager didnt see the piece of paper in the mac and cheese i informed the server as soon as i was able to get a hold of her  and she brought another one out the manager came to say sorry but didnt offered to take the meal off the tab since my son had to wait another 10 min to eat with us the server never bought us refills or checked on us to make sure everything was ok
we are so happy we did and we will return
one half point deducted for an extremely heavy hand on the salting
i wasnt expecting my meal for free or anything but a simple im sorry to hear it wouldve been nice
ok good sir i hear your argument i will now investigate
i had sole milanese and mushroom tart for lunch as part of the restaurant week special
for the past two sundays i have gone to puck sports bar for sunday night football and wings
it was clear that every item on this dish was homemade and not frozen
from start to finish everything was taken care of
but the ambiance and staff here definitely leave something to be desired
ponied up at bar before it got too busy
that is all
the poor lady is covered in drinks
the hostesses are terrible
the place was pretty crowded  which i dont mind and the drinks were a big disappointment
the is a place i wouldnt hesitate to take out of towners or recommend to locals
we felt that this place was way to overratedthe for was sub par for other dining options in the area
i got it with the honey mustard dressing which in itself was excellent
as i pulled the batter away from one of the artichokes i could taste that it was a marinated artichoke which was clearly canned or jarred
without being overly wordy lets break down the punch room 1 atmosphere 2drinks 3bob peters arguably one of the top bartenders in the southeast  making craft cocktails and being the most gracious and welcoming host
for food all i ordered was dessert and a drink
in a rush to get from point a to point b but still enjoy a nice lager or ale i found myself on the front porch of the peaks peeking at a beverage listing and selecting a pasta dish
bartender instantly and honestly told us they might be out of one of the ingredients thus wouldnt be able to make two but it was saturday night
i tried the crab stuffed chicken with capers lemon jus and spinach and sampled some of my brothers filet mignon boursin creamed spinach crispy potato for 36 and his gfs beef short rib stew with a side of corn bread green chile fried egg
however the bar the bar is why i go to the sparrow
our mains were the tagliolini and tenderloin
this place has a lot of kinks that need to be worked out
decent sheesha in pittsburgh
again probably overpriced but one of the cheapest items on the menu
nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff
story is a little hard to follow but it was great
i got charged for 7 toppings on a pizza that only had 35 toppings on
my personal favs are giggle water corps reviver and the jaguar
tragic  the rooms are not dirty they just arent the cleanest youve seen and when its as dark as it is here it just doesnt feel as fresh as youd like it to feel in an hotel
since it was a blustery saturday i declined and she took us to a better table on the other side of the restaurant
eine absolute frechheit
service was faster than i ever expected
lettuce cups steak
there are also some games ping pong cornhole etc
check your bill
the king bed was large and super soft
my husband went for the ultimate and i just selected my own toppings from the menu
the times ive gone were around lunch to afternoon times
once you actually get into the place its pretty nice looking but during my visit there was a cover band playing that was so loud my ears were ringing
simply fantastic all the way around
she takes one bite and immediately has a reaction to the peppers they usedafter i specifically stated there was a food allergy
standout was the salmon everyone loved that but i did not try it
everything is worn and past its primeand its prime wasnt so good either
good selection of wine if you are not feeling the beer that day too
if we come back it will definitely to do drinks because the service was great
we sat in the balcony but it still felt like we were really close to the stage
spinach and artichoke dip is my favorite appetizer and i usually order it for a meal
our room was missing the hooters bar stools and table that they claim on the website
dont get me wrong the coffee here is fantastic
the set up they had for larger parties was horriblethe servers have to walk by with trays over the customers headsit was super dangerous
enjoyed breakwater for the first time during their mothers day buffet this weekend
i needed a package that wasnt offered on their site and brandon put it together for us
the boys tending bar dressed in their twenties attire newsboy hats and all exposed brick walls really beautiful recreated vintage chandeliers your option to sit at the bar or an old fashioned booth
because of the beer menu
i dont particularly like blackfinn but its usually the first stop on a mischievous night of bar hoppin
theres so many things to choose from including  prime rib  seafood  sushi  dim sum  noodle station  omelet station  and most importantlypeking duck
i typically get the turkey burger with avocado tomato mushrooms and onions
service was just alright
jeff was our waiter and we couldnt have ask for a better waiter
good little spot
i would give this place three stars but top 5 reasons for one star v the atmosphere is sooo typical of what you can expect inside lv stand alone bars
theres some degenerates but nothing too crazy
busy place on the weekend but dr gs is well loved by the west end for a reason
lecker lecker super schmecker
seasons 52 i recommend it to anyone
get the peanut butter crunch burger  period
5 chicharon bulaklak  my hubby and friends loved this one
note  they are also having a late menu  11 pm to 5 am  so gives you a much better option than mgms studio cafe
i went in twice when they were slow maybe 10 people in the place and eventually left each time without being served
our server was great but ended up being charged for 2 bills
best vietnameseasian fusion food in town
it felt like shame seating for people eating alone
im a big fan of loco patron tempe and been visiting this location twice a week or more for over a year
clam chowder was very salty with lots of potatoes with its skin
first time being here and just left a bad impression
theres also bottle service tables and a viewing area on the patio where our hero had a great photoop of the strip
she came back with a new coke agreeing that the other was totally flat
sicherlich fr grssere gruppen interessant sind die spezielangebote wie zb
they even show the ufc fights which is a definite plus
they are big and tender with the meat practically falling off the bone and a delicious taste that still has me craving them days later
i guess i am going back to penn fish
when i checked in there had been little wait
with that said i stayed for two nights and when we entered our room we noticed they did not give us towels our tv did not turn on and valet took 20 min everytime instead of 10 all these things were overlooked however our experience got worse
luckily we werent there for work but this would have been a huge problem if i needed to be productive
the manager came out to apologize for the delay because it was not cooked perfectly and chef has to redo it but it was given to us as an complimentary
great service good food
definitely a fan of this place
bottom line there are many many mexican places to chose from in the lv valley
the interior design and ambiance were great
thats not bad for the strip
food is just okay
will definitely go back
i had the caesar salad and thought it was very good for the price
the service was great our servers were very attentive to us like some sushi restaurants this belongs up there
on their website it said that happy hour started at 3pm but when we got there they told us happy hour didnt start until 4pm
how have i never been to the swizzle inn before
the service was awful
i happen to get dessert
we ordered 2 expensive dishes with lobster which was not impressive but the small steak was pretty good
maybe i watch too many gordon ramsay shows but i agree that the tuxedo attire for wait staff is a little funeral home
they had a dj for on a friday morning was a bit much
again since it is small it will be very crowded and difficult to move around once things start heating up
its about the whole experience and our server made sure we had an amazing dinner
today sunday took my bride and granddaughter here for some chi town style pizza
try the poms on your sweet melon
their beer cooler takes up a whole wall and i love looking at all the microbrews the labels and the varieties of beers even though i always order wine
it is also very funny
i couldnt finish it
very fast and good service
our server was really nice though putting up with a large party and our requests
the best was the smoked eggplant
no gloves in my own kitchen  fine
thanks k bye
the guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine crab cakes osso buco and the crepes for dessert
large plate portions are not for hearty appetites but definitely an upgrade from the small plates
the simple act of dining al fresco while enjoying the fountains visual and aural display would have been enough but was wonderfully complemented by a splendid meal
food was good  reasonably priced
i really liked that area space was big enough to hold all the stages and small enough so youre not walking 500 miles to see your next favorite artist
in fremont east theres a dearth of casinos so el cortez and downtown grand are the only decent options when not boozing it up dont tell mama griffin beauty bar around there
bed comfortable keurig in the room great shower very quiet and overall excellent
it was a very thoughtful gesture
i had the french dip and the meat was very dry thank goodness for the aus jus
this is definitely one of my new faves in the burgh
these guys really rock out the 60s and 70s stuff but the 80s songs were the best
the 299 lunch special was a hamburger and a drink
nice bourbon and whisky selection as well as flaming drinks on tiki thursnight
i was expecting 23 oz but received what appeared to be more than 12 a pound of pure delight
melt in the mouth too the beetroot serving as a gently earthy undertone to the traditional chickpea and garlic mix
after my boyfriends surprise birthday dinner i surprised him with ka i dont know why but  i had it stuck in my head that the show started at 9 so we rushed from dinner thinking we were 20 minutes late when in all actuality we were 10 minutes early because it starts at 930 haha  1 star  for the friendly staff
check it out give it a chance
taco mac seems to be the go to joint for game nights
the fries were lovely  so was the beer
the food and cocktails are very good
my husband got a steak and asparagus
things dont appear as advertised
because in my opinion it isnt rocket science to heat up some meat and put it on a plate isnt it what the cavemen used to do
fontina was also nicely melted
ill visit again
the peppercorn burger came with a peppercorn sauce to pour on the burger which was delicious
i come to this place more times a week than i should probably admit but its so good
i love their martinis and i love that when youre halfway done with your martini they bring over another cold glass to replace your existing warm one
even managed around 20 young kids who were feeling kinda crazy
the 3 of us ordered off the az restaurant week menu great deal even with the extra charge on certain items
talk about some delicious and notsoexpensive food on the strip
one filled with tables and the other a bar area
it is difficult to find a server when you need one and they seem pretty rushed when you do get their attention
dancefloor definitely has more room and theres a lot of seating
and we got to experience lexpress at the last minute without a reservationyou couldnt wish for more given our lack of planning
our waiter was a zero
bartenders are really nice
we were invited for a preview brunch last saturday
these guys need a better manager that place is a dump
the miniburgers were the other showstopper of our meal
but i must reiterate that we had a wonderful time with our server and she was outgoing hospitable knowledgeable and helped us have a great time
i really want to go back to try the other dishes perhaps their flammekeuches flatbread and oyster towers next time
service was good throughout the meal
patio is always crazily busy be sure not to sit at the table next to the umbrella when they bring it down youll be barely able to see the person youre eating with which i learned the hard way
we ended up ordering all three for our reception
they dont have food but i believe you are welcome to bring your own spread
he was very entertaining and stayed in character
cooked perfectly  i had the hot with the hottest sauce on the side  these are handsdown the best wings i have ever had
however the happy hour before 6pm prices for drinks were a great price
7  kale salad was cut too big
i have been wanting to try cornish pasty co for some time but i honestly thought it was just hyped up on yelp
the designdecor is fresh colorful and simple in a trendy kind of way
or maybe they were playing a who can yell mother effer the loudest game
managers visited every other table to see how the meal was however totally ignored us
danny runs the front and master chef steve runs the kitchen like a well oiled machine
oddly the sous vide sirloin and rib eye beef ended coming out which was delicious
always excellent and receiving wine samples are always fantastic
too bad the food and service are not
imported tomatoes can be good but you have to do something about draining the liquid out or they will make the crust soggy
overall one of the worst clubs in las vegas
sooooi convinced my grandpa to come here with me which was no easy feat
plenty of room to accommodate our large crowd both smokers and not
would be great to come and do some homework or meet up with friends not very quiet though if thats what youre in to
they dont seem to know what theyre selling
as for the food it was fine but it did not meet my admittedly high expectations
this place is amazing value  if you book online you can get it as low as 15 and night  we wound up paying 30  but compared to the 500 alternatives  there is nothing to grumble about
came for dinner around five oclock
the lobster mac and cheese is very good and rebecca took great care of us but theres nothing remarkable about this place
my hub ordered these and stole some quesadilla and duck
nothing like sipping on a cold beer and laughing with a good crowd and host
took a few minutes to be recognized and then when our name was taken the people after us with a similar party size were seated before us
on the week days they are slow so its usually nice and quite
we had few drinks  and were ready to chew on something  but  the barmaid  told  us that the  kitchen closes  at 8 and past that  they  only  have typical  sport menu so  weve ordered  the chicken  wings  that  gave  us  more reason  to get more drinks
waitress seemed really new but was good
one my favorite things about eds is the skiball amachine
they were also too expensive in contrast to the rest of the menu prices
i ordered a shrimp quesdilla that is supposed to have red peppers and spinich which were not to be found
weve always had a good experience and the extensive rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh
no food is served other than snacks
photo ops galore
no need for that type of play
this was a really good show i saw at the luxor
bad bad bad
nicely whipped poached egg on top
they had to have omnia staff stand at the dance floor entrances and block people from entering because it was at capacity for like most of the night
we ordered the ones with alcohol which i couldnt taste so thats good
he lived the wings
im so tempted to give 4 stars
im more of a beer guy anyway so i had a couple of craftbrews that are not available everywhere and then settled on a firestone dba  a very very tasty beer  and had several of those
we always enjoy our dinners here   theyre also on restaurantcom so you can get a great deal as well
my only complaint is the smoking but i guess its to be expected at a bar
i only gave the place three stars for serving a sandwich and fries that were not at the right temperature
it certainly lives up to the high standards of bellagios restaurant collection
anyone is welcome
it was built while i was attending duquesne and previously i would go here because of convenience as im sure most of the students do
meme where he slaps two ears on a stick from esqualitos hands
all the more quickly to get diners outta there before dancing starts later in the evening
ive never been disappointed with the food or the service
oh speaking of which
es ist hell  sauberund einladend dort
i am a red sauce kind of bbq girl
the pork and the sausage also tasted bland
the coconut rice was awesome as was the salsa
elevated dishes with a unique twist and great service
they have great specials and good bar food
having had ice wine many times before i was intriqued to try one ive never tried before
its definitely not for the weak of heart or stomach
the setup of the restaurant was beautiful and had a great vibe
id understand that there was a wait if it were busy but the restaurant was empty
the first 2 times my husband and i ordered the same thing he pork arepas and i ropa vieja arepa
the location is in a business park a little odd but there is plenty of parking close by
we also got the market salad
starters were luke warm a soup n a  aubergine
people who worked there were nice and service was good
compared to encore i would say this well worth the money
saw that wings were on special had a taste for them got the dry rub bone in
also note that breakfast is served 247 and the selection is amazing
they are not delivering on the whole supper club concept they would do far better to rebrand as a lounge
the prime rib was very good cooked just right and juicy with the right seasoning
i love this place
males females hostesses bar tenders wait staff
i know this place gets a lot of high reviews but come one when you have the chandelier and bond bars in the vicinity why would you bother with this one
a few of us went on sunday afternoon taking advantage of a comped daybed  foodbeverage credits
today i enjoyed on draft la folie sour ballast victory at sea  on bottle silly sour  wasatch orange blossom
went here with my husband for lunch
they were too strong for my wife so that meant two dinner cocktails for me
on the side
didnt need to do that so was given incorrect info by concierge at wynn towers great
so park by lunasfarmers marketgym and walk around to the back if you are paying a visit
my friend and i didnt even notice it was gone
its a nice place if youre in the mood for something with red meat but if you are in the mood for a really really good burger and you have a set of wheels you might want to drive up the zeli
i am sad to see it go down hill
i would definitely go back with a date andor friends
i got the chicken club sandwhich which was full of chicken breast guacamole  blue cheese which i didnt know came on it but was good bacon red onion and tomato
the sausage was cut in halves so it had a nice grill char and flavor
i had a delicious oriental chicken sald done just right my boss had the brisket lunch special  minus the bread the coolest thing and i posted the pic
its super mellow and caters to those looking for nonvegas type hotel read wynn bellagio etc  that being said the location is ideal because you are next door to aria vdara  cosmo if you want to gamble or party  the room was awesome and super hitech
i think i liked the chicken taco best
after enough time i finally submitted to the sake
i feel like this restaurant belongs on king west its rare finding a restaurant like this uptown
once inside we found out that there was a wait but she mentioned that there was availability at the bar
lovely atmosphere for a night out with your significant other or even a good place to get together with some buddies
i had spicy tomato bisque
i was quite excited about going to this place till i got there and found that their claim go fame is just putting lobster pieces in or around other dishes
i hope its happily ever after for them
the steamed bun was delicious
especially when you want to eat an all you can eat buffet
lots of elbow room
and to see the games
for guys cover was 20
as there was no line and it was just us it couldnt get any more obnoxious than this and we left
there is also a patio upstairs which is nice
die preise fr cocktails sollten noch einnmal dringend berdacht werden  da gibt es selbst in der innenstadt bis auf ciba mato keine bar die solche preise abruft und oft nach happy hour angebot haben
try a rocket pop or a hulk
a numerous amount of tvs displaying everything from golf football and basketball to ufc fights even wrestling at times
upgrades such as fruit bowls phunnel bowls and ice in the vase are available
honestly the only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars is because someone stole my chapters bag with three books i had just bought  who steals books
this was my first time here so wont get too superlative with praises but well done
will likely come back when 1 i have a designated driver and 2 i can kick add at mvc2
they offer typical barpub staples and then some with a twist
very good food
they torched different wood chips right over a glass of whiskey then cupped the top so the smoke would infuse right in
the manager tyler was so helpful and accommodating to my special requests
so without reservations on a busy saturday evening in the summertime i ventured in
the salad was ok not bad for a lunch soup and salad
not this place
great view great food great prices and close to downtown where i live
the bouncers there are pretty laid back and not too critical when the place gets rowdy up front
dont miss the ceviche for appetizer perhaps the tastiest item i tried
best dessert ive had in phoenix
we just stopped in and kyle rocked our socks off
they are concerned overall but dont really care about you as an individual guest
no amount of words can describe how much i love this place
although i think the dinner menu is a bit pricy i do love their awesome happy hour specials
mmmm mmm good
a side salad is an additional 250
give it a try
we both ordered the ribeye steak
all was good though the adrenaline rush pretty much killed my buzz
now i knew i was gonna hear it
such rude service we left
none of which have nearly the prices that javiers holds
as mentioned in another review this is a great date night spot
our waitress never returned to give us drink refills never returned to see if our food was ok never returned to see if we needed anything else
i had the adasi lentils which had such a bright flavour full of lemon and parsley  yum
the salads were fresh and the dressing was definitely homemade
and a bar
of note brunch at josephines toast so basically add an egg to any of the toasts and they are amazing
i have ate at many places on the strip and bahama breeze far exceeded them
nice place to hang out with friend food is average wine was good had a burger with french fries
the staff is super nice the environment was neat
i waited rylan was friendly and awesome
will definitely be going back shortly to have some more carpaccio
we got here pretty late thinking it would be really poppin by this time
us girls live for this stuff and i wish i wish we could have said something good about it
it has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a very generous portion of pieces of steak
its a hole in the wall but dont let that keep you away its no glory hole
we went sat
the shepperd pie end up looks like a sheep diarrhea on a left over mashed potato from a week ago fried calamari like a already chew bubble gums boiled in a cornmeal and the shortribs like left over bone from my dog
wow what a down grade
this is a great little spot tucked away unsuspectingly on camelback road
i was not impressed with my steak
cooked to perfection
noticed the beautiful old gold coins on the counter set in a honeycomb pattern which mirrored the honeycomb wallpapering at the normal and later on i was able to check out tapacubos womens restroom to find that theres honeycomb wallpaper there too
hands down my favorite restaurant and lounge in the valley
thats how i heard her
somy 15 minutes at michael mina at the bellagio has scarred me for life
i went to this ellis island for the cheap food not for the ambience or class
the floor was grotesquely sticky and wet there were creepy dudes everywhere and every childish girl in there was talking shit about other girls
as a kid waffles  ice cream were our reward dessert when we behaved at the local fair
the gentleman taking our order was very informative and helped us make decisions
its 1 am and i could use a beer right now
we sat in the end most outer side of the patio and the place was empty since we came so late for lunch and the waitress didnt mind coming up to up for water drinks and food and she even came up a few more times to check on us to make sure everything was gravy awhhhh i love this place
i usually get claustrophobic and run out
i like the electronica playing and it was never overly loud although we were there early
service was prompt and polite
my first time ever doing this kind of thing and it was absolutely amazing
we went when it was pretty busy and i wouldve loved to ask the waiter questions about the beer but he was running around like a crazy man
but still there is no cover here
and again i am not impressed with the food and this time the customer service as well
my friends all liked their dishes and the chocolate dessert and xrated vacation martini i had was good could have been a bit more fuller in the glass but still sweet and yummy  just what i was craving
one day ill come in for the brunch and try something different
once we got our food at the table she flat out ignored us failing to check up on us once
get them with a drink and bounce hahah thats it
so in that order service was awesome
i love that the menu changes but i do miss some dishes dearly
i sat patiently waiting for the big fire opening at the beginning of every hibachi experience but this time it didnt happen
the wait is usually not too long and usually worth it  i usually love the frittata and ive also had the hash
i walked terminal 3 and the options were pretty blah
i would recommend going to one of the many other movie theaters that have upgraded their seats but dont charge more for the tickets and dont treat their customers this way
first i took the trouble to explain to the first server that we as brits like to drink
they couldnt even cook it correctly
they do not serve full meals but if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and maybe play some pool darts squash or beer pong while listening to live music or a dj then dbs is a great place to try
when we arrived at 630pm we see that the restaurant is basically empty
i should have more details but bottom linejust go there and try something you have never had before
the staff is friendly and the price is right
our servers have always been nice and helpful even though it is a busy place so naturally it can be a little loud or take a while to get your food but thats kind of expected considering its location and size
i definitely recommend trying them out
he was great but a little too late
tonight we had a pizza
we tried the adult grilled cheese which was delicious with bacon and jam on it
the staff was very friendly and the food was very tasty and authentic
we will not be returning after the very poor service that is unacceptable for a highend resort
the only thing that bothered me a little was that it leans a bit too hard into the club atmospheregangster raphot babes at the bar territory in terms of aestheticsmusic etc
i dont drink a lot of beer so id like to see them add some old fashion style soda pop or maybe a root beer on tap
i wasnt aware there was a competition but she was correct as clearly a person who waited as long as i did for oysters was in no position to be victorious
im glad vtr was closed because we had a great experience at dragonfly
i went here for dinner this past friday and it was superb
not a bad choice for that side of town
this was actually one of the best burgers i have ever eaten
we will return here next football game
sometimes the service can be godawful slow in the mornings and i dont mean the chef
which leaves me wondering why they dont  change their carding policy
yes you heard me right
even though we are locals we have never been here before and we would recommend it to anyone whether youre a local or just visiting town
i love this venue
so you have to leave it on this table where people have access to it
the other girl then still has more jokes up her sleeves and says with an attitude well im just trying to get out of here on time tonight
i tried coming here off and on over 10 yearsthis location struggled to find a business and it seemed funks was really taking off and had a good thing figured out
although our price came out to about the same amount i like that we were able to try a lot of different things
dont bother with the socalled line passes
all in all great this year saw an expansion in the length of the festival as well as the festival grounds
maybe i wouldnt like this place as much if i was completely sober and quite honestly the thought of coming here at peak late night hours when this place is probably overflowing with drunk students makes me crinkle my nose but at any other time this is a good place to come for cheap eats
i repeat divine
this was our first time eating at miller tavern and perhaps we expected too much but we shall not be returning
the food took a while to come almost an hour
we happened to come during happy hour so we took advantage of the half priced margaritas which were phenomenal
we also had the churros
i dont usually get specialty drinks so i have no room to judge their full service bar although i will say that our server was a little impatient and screwed up my end tab
i would have given them 5 stars if not for this rule
im sure if it went for a brunch and perhaps dinner i would be giving a 4 star but this is just my experience
finally made it over after work with my son
i would rate them a 45 food and service was about a 1 this evening along with the value
apple crisp pie for dessert was the perfect ending to an outstanding meal
why you ask
saying that you wont be as disappointed as some of these reviewers if you know what to expect
it was everything the other reviewers said it was
on the plus 2 stars for my margarita thatcher it was excellent when i finally got to order it and it finally arrived at the table
the atmosphere location and staff were also pretty good
my boss and i headed to z tejas today
the small lobster tail in my 100 dang
he never checked on our food
i love this venue for concerts
after being told it was a 3 hour wait for our bay we decided to get some food and drinks
wait staff very attentive
and had fun playing games all evening
bar is well stocked with a good selection of red whites including a healthy selection of draftsbeer by the bottle
despite going during happy hour and splitting two apps and one entree our bill was still 40 total so not a great value we didnt get any beers either
whered it go
i asked for her last name and she responded give me your last name as if we were in middle school dissing each other
the fried chicken taco is great by the way
i understand that they cater to a younger crowd however i wish there were a few more sophisticated cocktails
pair it with some green tea and it makes for a satisfyingly different lunch
sadly nothing on the drink menu comes in at under 10 but at least there is some artistry at work here
he covers music from motown a little hip hop dont forget the blues and great 70s songs such as do you remember from earth wind  fire  and adds a bit of sax to every song
we were obsessed with the aioli they serve and the chef was nice enough to bring us some extra
the bar setup is really nice
it was that the dj at surrender had serious add and couldnt play a song for longer than 20 seconds
we tried to kill it but its a roach we were shocked
i had a bite but was so full that i felt i couldnt totally enjoy iti do recall it was flavorful
in general the menu is subject to time to time depending on freshness of ingredients and whats available
it was a 500 min for the day and though it was pricey it turned out to be the best idea ever
the tacos were yummy
the wings are just fantastic
the iron skillet chicken for dinner is a solid choice and i always enjoy a good shepherds pie
larry tried to get us to have dessert but we passed on it
the food was delicious
ohio beef burger side of fries added for 4 it had been so long since i had eaten a truly memorable burger i had almost forgotten how good such a simple food could be
my favorite aspect of the show was the lead singer who had one hell of a voice
i am extremely happy with this place
the main was ok a pie but not very imaginative
upon receiving the gnocchi it was divine little pillows of heaven was what we called them
they offer a military discount for cardholders and there is a childrens menu
my wife and i waited as nongaming customers loafed on the machines
service nicht vorhanden
i enjoyed the grilled ham and cheese with tomato soup
but inside cape cod
this brewery only does belgians but they do them well
it really could not have been misunderstood
room was cool thats all that matters i guess
its certainly a cool room but the food is struggling
fail in my book
food was unimpressive
i automatically fell in love with the design and dcor which was a combination of industrial rustic and prohibitionthe host politely greeted us and we were told it would be about a 2030 minute wait which was fine with us because after all it was a saturday night
quel endroit magnifique
thats what i imagine deathbederic saying as he looks back on a fulfilled life
the kitchen closes at 10pm but we were told they could do boneless wings and the flatbread
they also expanded since i was there so the added bars and game room were a big plus for our 10person group
it was the rudest occasion all involving an orissa car bomb
we were looking for a magic show that wed enjoy but that would also be appropriate for my 6 year old son
so after looking around for a new place to try out i settled on this very nice restaurant
ms cha cha enjoyed the other delicious burger with bacon on itbacon burgerno fancy namingoh well
the fact that its also a full service sports barrestaurant with decent food and tvs at every bay where you can control the games you want to watch makes it an incredibly easy way to spend a few hours
i did not like the shack stack burger it had a cheeseburger as well as a deep fried portobello muchroom stuffed with 2 types of cheese
great bar menu
the gm came by and said our server would be right with us and offered to take a beverage order
so leave the kiddies at home for this one
we met a group of friends here one time and one of them got sick
sardine has a lot going for it great location great ambiance views of the lake
i was really disappointed and will probably never go back again
pork taco tasteless and soggy
two we asked four people what time they close and no one would give us an answer
the furniture and appointments are very modern yet classy
the mango tea was excellent though
anyway i was craving a fish fry and after stopping to see that the fish fry at merchant was outrageously expensive 16 we stopped by madisons to check out the prices
legion has a cool laid back space
i love the green chili
that didnt get done pizza was not that great their sauce was just bland
disappointing experience so far
not a fan of that one either
not sure i want to go back
now the stage at this place is pretty awesome
you can find me on the slots or being reckless on roulette but i hear that the blackjack tables are where its at
i will not be back
i highly recommend subbing the banana peppers for candied jalapenos
our server was really attentive and friendly and i finally got to meet thomas s who was really cool and so much fun to chat with
maybe they should rename this place fusion tortilla joint  this way people can better prepare their taste buds and expectations
i found it awful and even though the rest of the comedians were alright hhs unfunny performance left a bad taste in my mouth
thank you to fausta
ordered a simple steakhouse dinner of caesar baked potato and filet mignon medium rare
the device was the genius of this show and makes it almost worth seeing
the selection and prices are great
100 zabiha halal and this is the first time im not getting ripped for halal meat
the owners raina and aj are so friendly and make everyone feel welcome
the upstairs is dedicated to national culture and traditions
tvs limited to cnn and weather but heyit is an airport not a sports bar
we had finished dinner and their happy hour had kicked in
to each their own with the beans consistency but you get what i mean
a great spot that is away from the strip
it really is a nice spot and its a place to which ill return
both were pretty good although not overwhelmingly great
food and ambiance at saddle ranch area really 25 stars at most but the service and drinks are always on point
i liked everything about my meal and it was a great christmas dinner
definitely a stop to make if youre in the central phoenix area
it was packed when we got here but the hostess lilly still got us a great table even though we werent locals
the two stars was for the mediocre food we ordered the service deserved a negative ranking
so we ended the night with two beers two 5 specials mussels and crab spinach dip  texas oysters not spicy at all and 12 lb snow crabs legs not fully in season
thankfully there wasnt anyone next to us on either side
le march de nuit est une excellente ide pour dcouvrir des artisans locaux et boire un coup entre amis
the beer menu was extensive and i particularly enjoyed the beer triptype thing 4 beers in shot glasses
a nice healthy portion of guacamole a quest blanco and a habanero salsa
not a disappointment
you cant not come here
we ordered the pretzels with queso nachos chicken tenders mac and cheese chicken salad and brownie ice cream desert
check out the wine list
there are no signs with any of these rules or regulations and to be honest we didnt even go in
il est suggr de faire un choix de plat froid et un plat chaud car il semble que les portions sont petites
not so much
but they have good video poker machines and the bartenders are friendly pour stiff drinks and dont tell you that you have to play max bet on the poker machines to get free drinks
awesome place to hang out
what a disappointment
spa and pool facilities are world class
i had ordered the pasta with chicken
service was excellent
their gluten free menu is gigantic and also includes gf buns baguettes and a wide selection of their menu including apps can be made gluten free
the poutine had onion cheese and pickles
we sat in section a row d and felt like we were there in the studio with the performers
they really push the all natural niman ranch beef thing but how about making those burgers taste great
the ambience is a 4 star
our bartender sarah was amazing
one of my favorite places for monday night football
i contemplated ordering another burger to get that moment backi guess i will have to come back tomorrow
eh this place is ok
came here for date night and had such a good experience
the second time around the service was much better
both came with seasoned fries which were addicting
no offense to the older crowd but the older crowd that is there up til 11pm stick to the bar like flys on cowpies
meat was dry and no flavor without the sauce  bread dusted in sugar is not a good thing
so please keep that in mind if you do decide to paint away
i wished that there were more of the yellowtail and it was a great way to start the meal
we got pasta in the bowl and steamed rice on the side both went perfectly with the dish
both tacos were tasty and not too ridiculously priced
so i guess they have me stuck eating here from time to time when my cravings hit
posh bistros often have open kitchens to showcase cleanliness the proficiency of the kitchen staff
the ambiance is the real reason why you should come here  spacious romantic and the servers really make sure you enjoyed your time
our waitress could not have been nicer or more attentive
the best i have ever been able to ever see with my limited cash flow
the library fundraiser on fathers day was a hit with the kids
the staff is always friendly but the prices are a little high
overpriced stuffy smoky and small
i thought the calamari was okay  not the best ive ever had but i liked the curry aioli
it does not get any better than this
the best part about it is its discreet naturekeeps the people away that need garish signage to point them in the right direction
staff friendly food excellent
service was excellent
they asked us if we had a great night and if everything was ok i thought that was nice
sauce routinely cleans all unoccupied tables to ensure that their new guests are able to sit down
no frills no decor and not a single piece of anything gold that would nod to the name of the joint
everything tasted the same bland and mushy
marriott brings a guest experience a level of professionalism that hard rock management should learn from
i also thought the portions were small for the prices
both drinks looked great and well presented
i wish that there were more choices for sides like vrious green vegetables
the only thing that came was my sons milk
the food is not good at least not for dinner
we were struck by the atmosphere right away
the philly roll was good as well
cream colored tufted leather sofa cream plaid carpeting
i ordered a build your own burger
really heavy on the rice  it reminded me of those perpackaged rolls you get at trader joes
we paid the extra 10 for premium plus seating which includes free popcorn reclining chairs a small pillow and a throw
they serve regular pub food but its always good
for my first visit i was on a knee scooter and crutches
family decided to go here for lunch today
it used to be like stepping into a horror flick
the vegetarian dish was an omelette with cheese
watch for the dust storms around casa grande though
dish 2 pork snitziel
it truly was a pleasant surprise and we all agreed we need to returnand soon
not to mention a few shower poles
history we visited barrio tremont during its first months open and had a terrible experience
the pizza was really good
love this place
the food is wonderful
second the best staff ever
it was cooked well i just felt the breading could have had more seasoning
no such luck
apparently they dont have buzzers to hand out or take numbers to text your table is ready so unless you were standing 3 feet away from the hostess desk theres a good chance you would miss your name being called
i hate having to do negative reviews but theres no way to sugarcoat it our recent visit to grandview saloon was just bad
we ordered fries potato pancakes with cheese sauce and a burger
believe it or not we would go back
i had the jalapeno and bacon grilled cheese with the tomato basil soup
that sucked big time
vu que nous sommes alles vers les 8h ce spcial ne sappliquait plus mais voila donc quon nous offre le menu  2 pour 1  qui signifie manger a moiti prix  excellent deal mon cher ami
but this review isnt about those
ive already left a review for this awesome restaurant but this time i wanted to give a special shout out to chelsea who does a great job at taking care of us during our letip meetings
they offered us samples when we didnt even ask and theyre suggestions were pretty spot on
the red sauce is way to sweet  im not going to go there again olive garden is a way better option to give you a idea not to mention most others
that sounded reasonable to us so we did what we had to do
the experience was 5050 the wings were good and tasted fresh but the artichoke dip came out lukewarm so we sent it back and it came out a bit hotter but not that great im thinking its nuked and it had a really bitter flavor
everything tastes good but is crazy expensive
this is one of my favorite small plate restaurants in charlotte
off the bat the air was either not working or not turned down low enough because it was uncomfortably warm throughout
definitely plan on coming back when i have my late night munchies
service was attentive but not annoying and any problems one burger was missing guacamole were quickly taken care of
could do w more syrup
the boy was running around the table with squeaky shoes and it was pretty loud and annoying
the booth seats are coming apart tables a rickety and the bathrooms are dirty
they wrote it down for us on piece of paper
the service is always impeccable and the staff is super friendly
i ordered two of the pork belly pastor tacos and one of the conchinita pibil tacos which are both pork
the doughnuts with dipping sauce and pazookie style cookie with ice creammmmmm
my salad was 16 and the tempura was 12
they even shook all our hands on the way out
they need a new cook
its very mesmerizing to see people who are so good at their craft up close with so much skill and refinement to what they do
but their steaks are good and for that alone i am a fan
sunday brunch also offers some excellent french toast
my sister had the crab cake salad and she loved hers too
id suggest renting a day bed  lounge chair  that way you have a dedicated place to hang out and the waitress comes around to serve you drinks
this is a true gem right here in wesley chapellots of gluten free options as well
i didnt realize people like the firehousers lived in pittsburgh
my only complaint was a chintzy piece of foie gras that was barely cooked and stringy
i thought this place was ok it was way too crowded
coming to the tacos one can go with the menu item or if you are adventurous make your own
i would have come back multiple times during my stay
he is fantastic
at first we ordered bbq baby back ribs and food was overcooked and dry
both good but we took home half of each sandwich which is a lot of food to waste otherwise
you simply cant miss this show
the dessert featured 3 flavors and they were outstanding  mint chocolate chip banana toffee and salted carmel almond
the wine loft was fairly dead which was surprising given that the universities are back in session and it was a wednesday night versus a sun mon or tues night
seems like regulars get treated way better than new customers
the atmosphere is great
i highly recommend ichabods to anyone looking for that old vegas feel
perhaps that rule should be considered ill put that in the suggestion box
worth stopping by if you are in town
its the little details like that which impressed me even more
updated the rating to reflect the average of the two trips
they have a food stand in there which i heard they had pretty good poutine but food sells out quick
the red pepper emulsion was great on the fritters
the space is really nice and the wine bar area is really cool
remnants from its predecessors take form of a neon light beaming the word electric and some donald duck figurines as well as sound boards which serve as wall dcor where the washrooms are located
atmosphere is divey but fine for me
plus salad bar comes free right now with their special
i would have given it 5 stars if the service had matched the food
i wish there was a way to transfer the menu to rock bottom which i really like otherwise
it was even better that one snapfax was valid for 4 diners so the two between our table of 8 section meant we could share the snapfax love
the dance floor wasnt overly crowded and there was decent dance space
its a nice place to watch sporting events theyve got multiple screens that usually broadcast multiple games
we had the lobster tacos and filet mignon sliders
its a cozy little joint
they offer an express lunch menu which when i inquired about the express 599 burger meal was told its a 3oz precooked well done burger patty isnt that a slider
bartenders arent the nicest and its way too loud to be able to hear them
you walk into the door expecting a middle of the road mom n pop experience and what do you get
weve been going there for over 20 years
i came with my dog and my friend and it was a pretty great experience
however the service is also good and the beers are always cold
the atmosphere is nice and we looked forward to a great experience
they look great but are slow as hell
my personal recommendation if you cant decide hot dog with chorizo chilli not spicy which i was relieved about caramelized onions brie cheese and some fresh spanish onions
even for a new york striploin if you can live without dessert you can get a 14 oz 4 more oz than with a complete plus a salad for only 4 more
id expect a much higher level of concern or eagerness to remedy the situation of a table whos bill was over 200
simple tasty and went well with the meat
it is a madison staple so if youre a tourist in the market for a tourist destination this isnt a bad place to go
like i said it wasnt busy
since my bf works for sbe there was literally no wait or fee to get in but i do know that it is 30 for guys and 20 for girls
that much faster for everyone else to be seated
no fries no slaw and my plate would have been great
you have to understand that hostesses being asleep at the wheel is par for the course at this location
we will not be going back
it was the most bitter thing i have ever tasted and i actually ended up not drinking most of the beer beyond a couple of sips
as i recall we ordered this 80 steak which was the best steak i have ever had in my life
i got a kick out of that
good drink nice patio and great bartenders
i had the wedge and my wife went with the beet
but theres something a little tired about picassos prix fixe menu concept
service was really good as well
in retrospect i should have ordered the crepes they looked better and might be more solid choices
greens were good and the slaw tasty
i rarely try other menu items but they have tons to choose from
sarah kept us hydrated while we waited for our order and the mood of the bar was festive and cheerful
overall very happy with this restaurant
the two veggie options for sandwiches were great a tuna one and a double cheese with egg sort of thing
they also have tons of beers on tap
when i asked the waitress if she recommend eating scones first she recommended it last because it might be too heavy and fills you up
ten minutes after this we decided to take matters into our own hands and go to the bar to fulfill the order
the service also gets really slow on the weekends
you can bet on the ponies here awesome
double vision was better than a dim blurry mess
for a while i forgot i was in arizona and thought i was back in spain with friends
i am late with this but this is my first post ever but wanted to alert people
i got the trevisio salad 15 and it was the same amount of vegetables as my tiny overpriced side at el catrin
twenty years ago their beer seemed like a revelation but now there are much better brewers in the area too
and the pistachio butter incredible
the next time we caught the attention of the bartender she said order something easy im too tired to make a drink
i went there after rave reviews that celebrities visit it when theyre in vegas
the best part is everything you could munch on is cheap  drinks and simple greasy food
this is a must go to sort of place
our bowls were ok nothing crazy spectacular but they were not lacking flavor either
place was pretty full at 7pm but by 10 pm had dwindled down to half a dozen tables
father very picky eater
the food was also okay my quail was a little soggy and too chewy for my liking but my friend really enjoyed the burger
i went with a group of friends and we were inforemd when we go there that we only had 2 hours time limit
moose is the owner of this kingdom
ive had the mojito 10 and five flower 15
lots of drunken irish clevelanders your parents age not a very hip crowd
this meat extravaganza also came with fried toast bubble and squeak mushrooms beans and a roasted tomato
to be honest the tastiness of my burger overshadowed the appetizers
the caesar salad had about three times as much dressing as it needed  even husband who likes a heavy hand on the dressing agreed with me
kind of annoying
burgers were expensive but worth the price
i feel compelled to update my review
i was here when it first opened and returned again recently and i can tell its really settling into itself
for anyone returning after a long time youll noticed they  moved into the cooler larger building next door and gave their old area to pane bianco
the ambiance was a little pink tacoish but none the less very cool
oh yeah they brought a yummy lil amuse bouche
i enjoyed the beef meatball with the arribiatta sauce served on a slidersoft and delicate like a meatball should be
great way to finish the tasting
heres to hoping ty largo does his job and gets the good word out there about citizen public house
celebrated a bachelorette here and had the best time  and thats all ill say because as the saying goes what happens in vegas
the filet mignon and eggs came out at a decent time but not the pancakes
i cant believe we waited this long to check it out
both were very well done and in decently sized portions
we got there shortly after 7 and they still werent charging cover
for perspective  i was a docs fan
i stopped in here while downtown and it was quite the terrible experience
north vegas is where you go when youve fucked up once too often on the strip and when youre not even welcome in the cutrate downtown places
we were told there was a 30 minute wait but we could sit and eat at the bar if we didnt want to wait
they put this ketchuplike sauce on top which gives it a tomato flavour
my husband and i both ordered the western burger
i had the fillet mignon and ended up getting violently ill a few hours later
when dining at hillstone it is a must to have the spinach and artichoke dip along with the prime rib french dip sandwich
the waiter was horrible
whole dining area has safe tucked away inside feeling
it was great because it wasnt too loud lots of space to move around and was easy to strike up a conversation with the staff
however as friendly as our experienced  waiter was he mentioned customers are not always right on and on he went
i got the chicken romano chicken salad which is always good
the poutine tasted like it was from canned gravy that had being warmed up
sadly this place has such an arrangement
i was not disappointed
not to mention a guy on the dance floor literally pushed a girl so hard that she fell over and security did nothing
the gm contacted me to apologize explained that he would be working with his staff to rectify my complaints and offered to have me come back so he could  make my next experience a better one
its a loud place has a juke box and the acoustics of a church
the food was very well presented and the main course in particular was delicious
since a lot of orders go in at one time before the movie starts it takes a while so you end up getting up after the movie started  you miss part of it
the drinks were awesome both in size and tastiness
the food pure ambrosia  only exceeded by the knowledge attentiveness and sincerity of the staff  from busser to owner
the server also aware when we ordered that we were going to split the meals so they halfed the sandwiches and put them both on each plate
great music friendly staff nice place to catch the sunset and people watch
i dont get all o the gripes
i was so upset  couldnt believe she just did that
key lime pie had the right amount of sweettart
the breadsticks might be my favorite in the city when theyre seasoned properly
small friendly staff solid food
i first came to pjs for the monday night cheap laughs comedy show at 9pm hosted by russell roy over a year ago  and i have been back many times since
i am a creature of habit at times
always a fulfilling meal when i dine here
the server offered to warm it up but we were hungry
