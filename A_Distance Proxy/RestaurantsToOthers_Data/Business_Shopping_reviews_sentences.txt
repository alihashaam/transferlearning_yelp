im from california and recently got back a tumi briefcase i asked them to repair ripped linings and broken zipper and while they did make the best of what was given the briefcase was extremely usedold they forgot to patch up some of the inside pockets
i love west side market
food court even worse
they go over all the controls point out things that might be unique to the manufacturer and have a lot in the back that you can ride around on to get oriented to the clutch and throttle
i feel like the other review gave them a bad rap as they are one of the best computer service centers around
but the part was covered by the warranty right

previously went there and she was out to lunch at 1030 am really
i have to say that my issue is not with the store but with macyscom
the works is like a mish mash of random cheap books toys calendars and art supplies with the odd tourist tat thrown in
for some reason the part i needed wasnt in stock which was kind of strange since four days earlier when i made the appointment they clearly said the back glass would be replaced
good shopping center
i immediately fount two tw employees and told them what happened and pointed the guy out to them
kyle h tattoo is the new resident artist here and to say hes bad ass is an understatement

true one can be left alone in here to do your shopping
here i found friendly people but service was completely aloof
if an out of towner ever asked me what is cleveland like
i could literally spend a few hours and a bundle of cash if need be
i found it to be soso
sometimes i go in and dont even buy anything just to stare at the costume heads all lined up in a row
i came back within literally 6 mins with my wallet and there was another customer standing there at the register as all of the employees were ignoring the front
aok because they carry the basics
she looked at the receipt marked it and then handed it back to mewithout checking my bags at all
love this place
the bottom line for me always comes down to service and this store delivers superior service
walmart gets knocked for being to cheap in comparison to lets say target but here i was behind a woman essentially complaining that they were high priced
went in here with the idea to purchase a sectional
things are still fairly easy to find and their inventory is plentiful still
the wrestling figure booth prices are absolutely insane
the mall area  has a variety of exclusive high end shops way out of my reach and even tastes
the past few years i have been almost exclusively purchasing items online
um yeah two pairs
nearby there are lego toys star wars toys and greeting cards
worst customer service experience i have ever had than they blamed my increased anger towards them on me after waiting two weeks and chasing them down for an answer
the store also had a great selections of dresses and i was able to find something great for my granddaughter
however i blame the parents and i did hear the store announce that children needed to be supervised at all times
above all the staff is friendly and understanding
at this point i was angry
my wife and i couldnt believe what we saw
hard to beat sq
thinking i may just need to reset my password i tried to set up a new one only to be told that my account didnt exist thats funny
they said they were completely sold out
bring the family
basin white is like a tame version of lush

before i could finish explaining what i was looking for the woman behind the counter snarled weve been in business for 25 years and ive never heard of that
i was looking for a new eyebrow place close to my house and came across them on yelp
we were able to order a few diamonds the same day
they have a bad ass fish tank but need to add more pizzazz
i didnt think they really meant it but they do
a laser printer and my coffee machine
keep the customer happy rule 1
i stopped in to check out their selection of shoes and possibly make a purchase
my sole purpose was to show georges face and to keep the background as blurred as possible
waited another 10 for drop off they then accidentally put me as the wrong patient
i am now left with hyperpigmention all over my cheeks from this break out
admittedly the building isnt particularly attractive however inside this is a great little centre
we had a bad feeling about this place because they are not upfront like other competing stores about policy because being without a washer for more then a month appears to be possible with them
it has all my favorite shops ever
i have visited twice once simply to pick up a few succulents and again last weekend to attend a class
while the selections of jeans sweaters shoes and purses are ok i think this is a great place to come for dresses
a quoi a peut bien servir
perhaps its always been cool but i definitely think its established itself as less of a street for touristy items and more of a destination featuring independent boutiques with fashionable artsy offerings
there appeared to be a good selection of bras for larger women
it has been open for almost a year now though its definitely time the developers do something to get more of the storefronts filled
cute linen dress from calvin klein
if you are busy during the day and need your phone fixed correctly the first time efficiently call cory at icracked
we then headed over to the warehouse located at 1100 north 127th ave avondale arizona which i would like to add was over and hour away in traffic from the mesa store
she wasnt very pleasant but we tried to give her the benefit of the doubt knowing she will potentially loose her job
i was surprised they didnt take some of my other anthropologie jcrew and ann taylor pieces i dont think that they were very well versed in brands
the prices are tempting already and some of the dealers will do even better is you express an interest
that makes sense since they really did seem to care about customer service and did seemed bothered by their lessthanstellar ratings
we were greeted by a less than enthused young man who was rude to basically everyone who walked in except for a female customer he was flirting with
this location is right across the street from the fashion show mall which is convenient if you need to pick up a couple of items
everything was perfect
who wants a bunch of whiny kids around when you are trying to enjoy your cabernet and belgian gouda
ill definitely stop back by hobby lobby for sale items after different holidays but more than likely i will go to one of the other stores that isnt so cramped among other things
after she and i talked and i showed her what i found she thought maybe it was the others were just the battery with no tanks
the thing is i would had been back as they have a good selection of beads but customer service means more to me
they give demonstrations of some products but wont tell you how the trick is done
seems like theres always a sale and there are coupons in the sunday paper all of the time which encourages me to return
the complaints on some of these reviews about customer service seem based on time
the store is outdated and unorganized at the least
i love this coffee place
where it falls down is the knowledge of the staff
sure there were always some high end shops but there had been some real places too
so i decided to hit a few pawn stores before shelling out money for a brand new tablet all together
their candles are all very naturally scented and contained in glass holders
they also sell wedding jewelry prom and homecoming dresses
although some of the clothing styles found here are aimed for the younger crowd i can usually find a cute top or dress that suits my taste
we also left with a dress and scarf to wear to an upcoming event
they will make sure you find exactly the parts you need and theyll help you as much or as little you need to find those parts
the framing is great the turn around may take a couple more days  but 100 worth the wait
how could you not love this place
the very next day she called me and said it was ready
what i like most about this particular spot is their outstanding selection and the fact that they seem to keep everything well stocked but also the fact that they seem to get in some oddball plants that you just dont find elsewhere including other summerwinds
the staff there were superexcited about their shoes  the fact they had recently arrived to the forum chops at cesearsand they were all wearing kitty slippers  yes the men too
beware of the salad bar around 6pm
i was very impressed with the selection and quality of clothes but i will not be back due to the service
came here to get my watch battery replaced
they are a round layer cake w the whipped frosting found usually in their freezer area
after reading reviews here i called and nikki squeezed me in

the selection is wonderful and the staff friendly
alexandra is everything someone running a lingerie shop should be

anyone who want to have bad experience to losing money you can go to this store
good selection of cigars
some prices are a bit steep
when coming here i was really surprised  shocked as to how good the customer service was
the food court is oddly large although theres a paucity of food court vendors
i feel bad  before i came over i checked yelp and i saw this place was rated 25 stars so yes my expectations and standards were lowreally low
i dont know if it was because the cookies werent all that fresh probably recently refrigerated but the two i tried were cold and hard
um creative problem solving but i hope this isnt the norm
he also gave us some tips on putting it together
i will take my business somewhere else next time for big purchases
after 2 hours of pawing through a couple thousand records in some shops i usually find something but usually not what i am looking for
if a zero star was possible this is what they deserve
hidden in the basement floor is a giant discount store or floor where they sell household products at very low prices think of it similar to neo home housewares
4 what have you done to your employees
a haven for the lazy shopper that calls out for every occasionbe it the allimportant christmas stocking filler the thoughtful birthday present for the impossible to buy for or the sweet lovedup pressie bought just for the heck of it
if its a normal art supply they will probably have it but dont expect any frills
weve never had a negative experience there
do not open a credit line you will always experience bad service and complications with your account

if not a coded security door guards the entry
overall im pretty satisfied so far
i accidentally found omar who  helped us and both times he has gone above and beyond
store hours  9 am to 7 pm 7 daysweek parking in front of store
and how do they differ
they have big flashy signs like 2 for 20 or 3 for 15 type deals dont be fooled these are always the regular prices and if you need simple casual clothing these are fine as basics
love this store
for anyone whos done any traveling well this is hohum
turns out it came with one less magazine and not the night sights that it was listed for
i was only looking for something for a fancydress party but had i been planning an important party or wedding as a huge chunk of the shops stock is aimed at i would have gone elsewhere without a second thought
what it this

thankfully that associate was nice
this was a nightmare

i have 2 big problems with this mall 1 the food courts are filled with crap choices
outstanding customer service
i was talking with my family whether i should even leave it for cleaning when security came and told us i think you are doing a transaction here so come on take it outside the store
they may be more expensive but the experience will be much better and far more personal
im sure it makes business sense as by doing this theyll attract both younger and more numerous customers but when a charity shops main draw switches from saving some starving baby to oh my god i look just like audrey hepburn in this dress it doesnt say much for 21st century society
the store is clean organized and for the most part i can find what i am looking for
i would definitely be using them again and again
i almost wept when house of fraser took over jenners recently
mind you these laptops were definitely over 5 years and were just running very slow
they sold and installed jewelry that was thicker gauge than what she had in stretching her piercing
i wrote a letter to the physician and heard nothing back not even the consideration of a response by letter or by phone
i really liked 2 dresses but went with the 3rd one i tried on after trying it on a second time

the service here is quite friendly though the size of the shop and the meandering crowds make it a little difficult to navigate the store on weekends
on top of that justin ordered me three right contacts i dont know why i always lose my right ones
overall a good place to go if you have time and patience to browse and are looking for a bargain
if you go for that it will be worth the trip

tiffany  co has the best customer service
april got 18 out of 20 shots that were absolutely beautiful photos
but my last visit the owner himself said that i cannot conduct my business in there
i dont know how or when but it will be a lot more convenient to be able to use a creditdebit card with them as with any other store  since these days i never carry a lot of cash
i am specifically reviewing the mall in this shopping center in case i am confusing the locals who might be reading this review
sky high does not deserve any more of my time but i wouldnt want my experience to happen to anyone else

very rarely have i gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that i would only request for them
shes the reason we keep returning for more photos of our daughter
well priced and they get it done on or before when they promise
the employee will reply yeah they always tells you one thing on the phone and then you get to our store and we have to break the truth to you in person
a bunch of us from high school packed the place and the mood was awesome
the staff is also amazing
still it was a good time
kaira was very helpful and not at all pushy
she was knowledgable and patient with my questions
but they have some cool cheap stuff and great decorating ideas
this is a really nice walmart i do enjoy coming here they have everything i could ever need for shopping
their hard work and dedication truly makes our grounds look stunning
every time i go in there im blown away by how knowledgeable at the staff is
theres really nothing special about whoever is behind that booth pretty much supply the background music because no one gets up on the dance floor
theres a generous selection of dvds of all kinds the continuing buffy saga in comic form and for all our vampires in waiting enough r pattz merchandise to keep the girlies happy
like a typical guy i waited 1 hour before my friends wedding to buy them a gift
well it was my first time doing the makeover so i had no idea you had to buy the gift card first
not only is she extremely talented at what she does but she is also very friendly and the cost is reasonable
nasty attitude from employee if you do not like your job dont take it out on the people that pay for substandard services and products that pay your wage
definitely recommend this place for your jewelry needs
youve kind of maintained that vibe over the years but as my interest in swirly polyester shirts and knockoff ck one has waned ive grown to like you more
she was there and i was there and we both saw me not buy them there
if one breaks no big deal we keep more in storage
overall this is a nice place and has some great food at reasonable prices
that was around 1 pm
never in my life have i been questioned by an employee of a store regarding what i would assume would be internal operational matters
he also communicated to me exactly what was going to happen this time with my chandeliers which should have happened the 1st time with the sales representative
i had a vision three particular different tables for my wedding day and it included a lot of colors and imagination and they were able to meet and exceed my expecations
their customer service was phenomenal the salon is gorgeous and the experience was fantastic
so basically a big girls charlotte russe i guess
when i contacted them to make the apt
the employees were friendly but werent super helpful
apple person was surprisingly knowledgeable about canadian prices and policies
i will not buy from stage 1 furniture again
when i got out of my truck i did a 360 only to discover that this area looked familiar
maybe theyre good with animals but they need to work on how they treat humans
also their extended warranties wont do you much good which is why i dont bother buying them
got that petsmart
my flowers made it to the grave site after the services
if youre looking for hard to find back issues this is definitely the best place to go
i have seen this woman firsthand be rude to her potential clients
when a company starts spouting policy my immediate reaction is to take my business elsewhere which is exactly what i did
what i liked most about this store is they dont breath down your neck to buy something
my boyfriend and i find much joy in thrifting and finding glorious things for super cheap
the exam was fairly typical other than the lack of bedside manners by dr pinon
aber man sollte sich ruhig reintrauen denn man kann so manche berraschung erleben
um i have to say this walmart isnt nearly as nice as some other ones in the valley
additionally theres every accessory you could ask for and for reasonable prices
i think the big reason ive come away with nothing is the store setup
i visited many shops in las vegas and was just about to give up this was the last bike shop i went into
i wound up taking the new part apart and installing the old parts underneath to make it work
with a great selection of books and a peaceful yet active atmosphere this barnes  noble is worth a visit for all book worms
i told him two more times to let go of me
i was here thanksgiving eve
i had a good idea what my insurance covered vsp but wanted to verify it and she was very knowledgable and helpful
the prices are reasonable for fashionabletrendy clothing and it doesnt seem like cheap stuff
all of the staff was extremely helpful and did whatever they could to make my search a little easier
it was in the mall and then inside a section called the union
we didnt buy anything but in sure we would have if we had the money
plz call there and make sure terra is working if u want to be treated great
it seemed as if every detail was thought out and planned very carefully
we had purchased a full insurance package and thankfully so
the food choices seem slim
unacceptable customer service
guys running the place are very friendly and professional
pissed off and worst customer experience at kamiya
i was very happy with that
bonus for shorter peeps like me and saves me a trip to jose your tailor to get alterations
we purchased our wedding rings from this store a couple of months ago and we were lucky to have had amy mei ames as our salesperson
but it is just too hard to make it so early on weekends
in fact i was hoping to buy my accessories there they have some gorgeous stuff but it would have been much better if i was able to try the accessory actually with the dress
he made sure i left there with what i wanted and needed and if they did not provide it he helped me look at many other options
after receiving county approval there was a delay due to something that didnt exist
if youve ever bought something from a discount store brought it home and then realized it was damaged beyond repair you know the hassle this saves you
i still managed to somehow undo the screws
however that ended quickly
my wife and i didnt buy anything because we were just browsing but the prices seemed reasonable
my bike felt so good  and the derailer problem was gone
it was a blast
after walking in having done my research and thinking i knew exactly what i wanted cody the manager was able to answer all our questions and helped us find exactly what we really needed
they try to find exactly what you need for your level of vaping not what you think you needwant
who am i kinding
id rather drive 10 minutes further to home depot then stand 20 minutes in line at this lowes
im really happy with what they have done with the place and they have a great idea going
put us two together and youve got a oneway ticket to hell
have to replace blinds that my friendly canine so kindly chewed on
only two stars because they might as well put a no firearms allowed sticker on the wall
they have great deals and cheaper than most places
vintage at its finest
people are rude and if you ask them a question they lie to you and walk away
the following week i was home when she came she didnt bring a brush and the only thing she did was throw a few tabs into the chlorine dispenser and left
yeah its packaged but for less than 7 you can get a decent sized chicken caesar salad
we were very happy with not only the selection but the service was great
if i need something i get in and i get out
i would rather go to nordstrom or saks pay a little more get a little more attentive service and clothes that will last
their food and coffee is without parallel
the inside of the store is one of the nicest ive ever seen in a walmart
the prices are a little more expensive than what i could order online but i figure with shipping it would probably equal out
the tint was great
it really aggravated my wrist pain to the point i have to go back to my surgeon on july 6
or perhaps it is the people swarming the streets beneath the sweltering sun beautiful people consisting of locals girls with bleached out long wavy hair an elderly man sitting outside watching everyone the store owners
worst experience ever
offer you peanuts for some nice name brand stuff
we asked for it to be unfinished and will paint it to match our decor
im not of fan of the sales staff at this lv
bought several hundred dollars of merchandise that i would defy anyone from being able to detect werent bought directly new from the designer
the center pieces were more beautiful than i had envisioned
the staff here is really friendly and always accommodating
of course without sellers there would be no buyers
so this weekend i finally drove my entire clan to check the place out
i have never spent so much money on a purse and i truly regret it
we went here on a lazy weekday afternoon so we were seated immediately
strike 2  i dropped off my prescription at 11am
this was not a cheap job but you have to realize these are large trees and difficult to move and will be well established in a few years and producing shade soon not in 10 years
the only reason why i give you even two stars is because i do love your jewelry selection
maybe the card reader wasnt really into it because i had to pry things out of her and ask her to explain the cards multiple times
i love the blakeney bevello just as much as the southpark location
while it doesnt have a lot in the way of furniture a few pieces downstairs it has plenty of everything else
this was a great incentive to try out the spa
she came back a few seconds later to tell me that they had nothing that day  but i could make an appointment for monday when i said no and  asked why it took so long to figure it out she hung up on me
as i dont have time for this game i am happy that they warned me about it
i am from out of town so this was my first visit to the cigar den  great place and very friendly
she is a liar and a thief and i am still in awe over the way they handled this situation soooo unprofessional
to me the draw is the imax theatre  the only one playing first run movies in ne ohio
38 cents in interest but if i dont its over 300 bucks in interest
when i asked him for help he said sure just head on back there and ill call somebody
typically i purchase my gear at nordstrom
i love the idea of them but really unless i had a very very large expendable income i just cant justify the cost
the lg oled is a beautiful tv with marvelous specs even for gaming
everyone talks about how difficult mattress buying is but we had just the opposite experience
they clean their beer lines every few weeks this means your beer tastes fresh and you wont get a headache from drinking it
since i had been accosted by one cleverbutphony spectacle after another for about an hour i initially thought i was viewing yet another when i stumbled upon a store that had a bronze illyrian helmet from the 3rd or 4th century bc in its display case
i went here on sunday as a tagalong with my sil who wanted to meet the grumpy cat
they have a good variety of yarns with many different colors
the good big store and tons of selection quiet and empty the bad limited staff can never find my size in undershirts small prices arent as good as youd expect only 10 days to return items i usually leave empty handed and find the place somewhat depressing
we have been to this location to buy gear prior to the fiesta bowl
love this place
very sophisticated styles
as for the prices they seem very reasonable
i was selling a gold necklace
at any other place we would have been given refunds
searched the internet for a flower shop and discovered flower petal boutique
were considering exercising the warranty and having them cone back
finally some jerk came up front and started heading to the wrong door
thank you jack and we will be back
it will ask you whether you have another tank to exchange
this place is a gem
my only points off
however there were many other regular exhibits that you could see without having to worry about the crowds
parking plenty of parking in the lot
love the brands clothing accessories and gifts store is similar to a higherend and older version of the urban outfitters combination of products and geared exclusively to women
it feels like its being run by an exmanager from kmart
i was also having a little issue with my rda and they of course took it off and fixed it free of charge with also helping my buddy polish his mods which is awesomethey have earned a new client for as long as i continue to use my mod
looks like they dont care to keep it clean when they arent filming any episodes
but i wouldnt come to this location if i wanted variety in terms of amount of brands they carry
im from the east coast and getting a great haircut really hasnt been a a problem
we sat on a couch and played mancala which made for a great sunday morning
so its not all bad
great service at elans
they were willing to reconsign the second item again for another 90 day period which was wonderful of them it still didnt sell but i dont consider that piece to be highly sought after  so i am just grateful they were willing to try
fun place in fashion show mall
she always told me that drinking coke can make me fat and not unhealthy
changeroomwashroomshower all in one with 1 shower stall and one washroom
with a 98 5 star raiting on yelp and 5 star raiting on google
wonderful water and customer service
we needed a swing  bouncer both of which were out of stock
the selection at strut is absolutely wonderful for plus size women
my current favorite piece of clothing is this heather blue tee that im rockin from there
about 2 months ago my boyfriend and i took a few vintage lunch boxes into gold and silver to sell and were met with the same pompous and rude attitude from him
the candy will melt in your mouth and the sunny botanical memories will stay in your soul
i wanted to purchase an ipad and a few accessories for my phone
by no means is this really a shopping mall but it does have everything you could possibly need in a mall
i again asked why i wasnt being helped and again i was told i didnt see you blind or stupid im not sure
however i have to say that they are worth the price
so even you weirdos who listen to things no one has ever heard of or shouldnt hear ever they have it
i live around the corner so for years they promised this awesome retail establishment
i asked a hydra zen serum of lancme
this is las vegas first kipling store
best of all when i got home i vacuumed my house the thing now performs again like the thoroughbred it is and after sucking a satisfying canister of dust and dander out of my bedroom slept for the first night uninterrupted by allergy attacks which is why im writing this review at 630 am so pleased and chipper
i went back to galaxy to get another mod for my friend to help him quit smoking
i dont really remember being here but one drink tasted like a jolly rancher and one was like a tootsie roll
all of their clothes have more than one in each size and tons of variety
well it took 7 months but i was back there againlol
we could use more spaces like this
excellent service fast and knowledgeable
thank you justin
i bought the signature selection of essential oils and diffuser it brings such a pleasant smell to my home  the sleep well roller is truly a miracle
i like my whirpools to be around 1023 and their large one was under 96 so its more like warm bathwater than superhot
the appointment started out with this guy asking me what i wanted to do i showed him pictures and i knew i was going to spend some money bc i have long hair
i parked far away to avoid any friction
their entire program which included being picked up near a hotel near scottsdale airport and driven to the canyon was just perfectly done
miranda rights arent read until after arrest
they change it up about every month or two and its all based around some sort of theme
i love being able to bring my own firearm and ammo and get some practice in
i have passed by this store many times checking out the various items hey the ladies have their shoes so a person who luvs to cook can have their cooking gadgets
you wont miss this outlet because it is so bright and welcoming
i dont go here anymore because management refuses to listen to the customer
bought some furniture for new house tonight
i highly recommend the hydrafacial
the people who work there dont even greet you and the customer service is non existantalso i find it disappointing that they  only have 1 size that fits all clothesthey have nice clothes and accesorieshowever most of them are overpriced
plenty of parking
in fact ive seen a lot of wedding dresses in the british red cross window
i watched her go nuts on someone about clearing a firearm then asking to disassemble it
we were able to walk out of the store happy and sleep on the mattress that same night
this store has absolutely beautiful clothing and various other items for your home
it will give me a boost and hydrate
yes obviously it is now dying
quiet clean and chic
sim swooped in and made us a deal on the split king adjustable bed that we couldnt refuse
hairstylists acted as if this was their first time
my friend and i shared the sliders that were fabulous and the zucchini was cooked perfectly
absolutely no incentives
at the time i was working with aaron who was extremely helpful
and nextdoor is a clothing store with a lot of paris apparel
i am very happy with my new stereo and even happier that i got great customer service and a great price
the employee said to call back in 5 minutes after he contacted the owner
i love this place
customer service is great
the flonase burned my nose and shot my blood pressure up
i came into this business not really expecting to be helped but i was wrong
very helpful and kind ladies and very beautiful dresses
yep im right there with everyone else
i bee lined it for a corner two person table and sat in sheer delight surrounded by beautiful artwork quiet rumblings of intimate conversation and the music of frank sinatra
i always go home having bought everything for everyone
one thing to note is that the signage on sc160 is minimal
theyve got pretty much all the major name brands here like tommy hilfiger banana republic ralph lauren nike adidas pacsun charlotte russe calvin klein coach and many more
my order even came wrapped with pink tissue
lesson learned even if the shoe looks good on the outside almost like the authentic brand
this associate knew i was in a hurry and dragged the procedure
i will never go here again
after pointing out my name on the license he just threw my license back at me onto the counter
update i went back to see them to have my ring checked and cleaned and they are no longer on scottsdale road nor could i find them at the current address listed
you would think that it would be really eerie concerning how bleak and lifeless it isits the exact opposite
do not use direct tv
was completely informed about the unit i wanted quoted the lowest price ive found and was so upbeat and personable one would never have thought that it was closing time
my 5 pound dog is out of her medication due to this inconvenience which means she can have a seizure at any moment
pricing was a bit more than other places 3 but the cap was okay
the only real downside is that the checkout counters are too close to the shelves behind them and any lineups quickly curl sideways and you cant get past
it makes me want to get back in my car and leave
this neimans gets a special mention from me because its the only one in the whole country that i know of that doesnt make you use amex or their store credit card
when i first walked in i was greeted by an elderly employee trying to get me to sign up for something
i love the cheezecakes here
the current cowboy exhibit is as usual good even though it is not my cup of tea
everything was all out of order walked out without buying socks
i prefer to drive to the tanger outlets than go to these which is only miles from my home
but if youve got anything kind of complicated or regarding your bill or online account id call first to make sure you arent wasting a trip or just head out to the north olmstead store
as such we cannot rate the latter two functions of this business
clearly understand now why they have so many bad reviews
i asked the employee if they had any additional colors and he tells me that they dont have any actual ipods to sell
i went to winners with my family originally in search for a large variety of clothes to choose from in order to be able to compare designers
the backpackers shop is just thata shop for all of your backpackinghiking needs but they dont just stop there
hate leads to spending 30 on 3 worth of black and white mms
they are the epitome of an excellently run local place and i went out of my way to spend more with them because i know they will take care of me i will ultimately be happier with my ring it will last longer we changed the material to gold and my wife and i so greatly enjoyed the customer service and chats with dave that it made the whole process a lot less stressful
management of my receipts and monthly income reports were decent but not great
i kinda feel that the good reviews were written by relatives
die kassiererin war sehr freundlich und rief einen kollegen zum einpackservice fr geschenke
so many fantastic nail techs who do a wonderful job
im so happy this store popped up right around the corner from my house and has a huge selection of merchandise to choose from anywhere from dishes to stuffed animals tokyo discount has it
dr lawyer and his staff are wonderful to work with
the manager was super nice and i will be ordering from this store from now on
so while it doesnt have the pulse of most apple stores it also doesnt feel like a cluster some others do
very small and cluttery like someones garage
they have cozy seating
also saw a lot of lv souvenir items here at pretty reasonable prices
they are so knowledgeable and always have great tips and tricks for your nails and skin
it is one of my favourite vintage stopsit is quite out of the way for me but i always try to make the trek at least once every couple months
for some reason this target store did not impress me
highly recommend to friends and family
highly recommend srp to anyone who wants a modern cut and style from down to earth people
they are understaffed most of the time
please again see this was outside the store
right from the first step into the door i received outstanding service and i felt welcomed
the free  limited monorail system ran though here from the monte carlo to the mandarin oriental crystals aria vdara and bellagio so you could jump onto the monorail to the other sister hotels
also saw some ted baker jeans
she has a great staff who obviously take the time to make a relationship with the clientele
super friendly staff on a day that the store was absolutely packed
this review is for the location in the desert village shopping center at pinnacle peak
the pharmacy is quick in getting your prescription ready within 15 minutes
too bad this kind of product is so accepted by so many
their pharmacy is 100 the very best i have ever been to
but the nail art due to the absence of the appropriate brush was unfortunately not up to either of our expectations
we will not be doing business with them as we are completely devastated over the situation
their bedding is super soft and cute and i swear one day i am going to buy a comforter from there
i was looking to buy a classical guitar and entered the first building by mistake
this place has changed so much in the past 5 years that i barely recognized it
electric lemonade is bigger and better than ever
im a huge fan
theres also the amphitheater although it hasnt been the same since its predecessor closed years ago
my advice avoid eye contact
jason the owner greeted us and was so friendly and made us feel quickly at ease
so many people crammed into the store with so few employees doesnt meld well
not sure as i havent completely looked through the entire store just my sections
although my description does not do it justice if you order it youll instantly want to get that ice cream flavor
why does it have to be so hard
also every single employee was ready to help and in a good mood
maybe its being picky but i dont feel that asking for clothes to be properly marked or shoes to be paired together is asking for anything radical
then another lady who fits the glasses does the insurance fixes issues and on and on
at one point she asked me to hold the phone so that i could feel how light it is
but i do know that if you are looking to sell some gold silver or other various olivepicking knickknacks this is the place to do it
every time i visit bbb the staffs were very helpful and nice
i left without buying the glasses but came back the next day to purchase my first pair
this place is my favorite
all aisles are redone and in the same direction
i mention to him my frustration about who was dealing with the insurance company and how i did a lot of the leg work and paid out of pocket for my repair
i called the word yesterday looking for a book by a quebecois author that i hadnt been able to track down
will not go back to this store
beware this is not a real verizon store when you experience problems like we did there is no help to remedy the situation where as with a real verizon retailer they are quick and professionaltruly the worst customer service i have ever experienced wish verizon would stop associating with these people very unprofessional often had blaring vulgar rap music playing throughout the store
the staff is nice
this is a lovely little card shop if you are looking for something a little bit special rather than the cheap sort you can pick up from a poundstretcher or a supermarket
it will last a lifetime
aaaaand your going to do this all while being friendly and knowledgeable
the voucher was only valid for 1 month  not the best customer service
then the manager michelle walks away and my fianc had to look at all of the upc codes just to find the right one we were looking for since the manager was too unprofessional to just find him the right product he was looking for
one day i plan to nab home furnishings for my place have to make enough money first i put that this place is moderately priced but i have noticed somethings are more on the expensive side rather than moderate or cheap but i still think it is completely worth it
simple and easy
i had to go back the next evening after work and start the transfer process all over again
the variety of scents is less than other places but i love every scent they offer
dresses too but didnt look at those
theres even a nice place to try on your shoes
when we picked up the final product my fiancs smile was from ear to ear
it seems as though employees are a little too focused on selling their addon services instead of helping customers or even having quality products in the first place
im so happy this place exists  i hope people realize that local businesses help the community  improve morale in general
worst experience ever
if your a member you usu dont have to wait
i took a slightly different route and walked down gladstone and there pavilion was
my friend was also looking around for shoes but had a harder time since she is a size 11 the guy working at the store was pretty helpful
one of the few stores around where i cant stop browsing
i had a display more than a trophy need and they came up with great affordable solutions
hubby found a marvin the martian shirt that was amazing but the wrong size
ive got no complaints
mr phil  children first academy child advocate
the lady tells me that since the pants were on sale at some point in the last thirty days she can only refund me fifteen dollars
they have a great heap of psychedelic records and reissues that are worth purchasing
the owner jennifer greeted me and helped me with my jacket and put on a robe for me
he was walking around the range just in case anyone needed help
like amy has said joy brings a littlewell joy to an otherwise frankly depressing shopping centre and will probably realise its in the wrong place and move to the high street before long
i ended up going to the warehouse since i missed sameday delivery option but the worst part about that was the drive
its reaffirmed my faith in humanity and honesty
it was a competitive price on the adult sandals and shoes as well
so the reviews that mention the wretched smellduh
hoping that what i selected with their helped could make me saisfied still after a few minutes out in the door was thinking of upgrading againthe lady was very sweet again and no signs of stress but  no can do the style i like had to be called in for that night and i needed to come back the next dayunfortunately  i have a flight next early morning
she took the measurements then tried to convince me that we need a build out as the frame wont support a pressure mount gate
vape  co always have such great juices mods and customer service
i wasnt in the shop for more than a minute when i met with james  sales extraordinaire
all said and done i walked out with a new i phone at a price i couldnt complain about
not my intent and i certainly would pay a premium for service
if you plan to eat at encore dont expect to pay anything less than 30 for an entree
i cant wait to sport them
i would recommend pearson moving to anybody and everybody
we tried to get them cleaned but were refused
this was way over the top and i felt so thankful for krista and trissa and their exceptional customer service
they have a selection of really diverse clothing for both men and women
old town is craggy and tightly packed but very quaint
that was almost 200 because they charged for new window installation as well
five stars to a branded store
again these are made you feel welcome and at ease when you come into their store
after spending the money to fly both my daughter and her fianc in for the weekend we showed up at the salon on saturday as previously discussed to find that the dress had been shipped out for a trunk show
to have a huge store and yet be tiddy props
which art supplies are always expensive but these are some of the best prices ive seen
i picked up a pair and the tag said spd compatible
thanks guys for being here when i need you casey reppas
so much confusion in the parking lot its ridiculous
lots of jewelry
then you check out and they print out pages of receipts
the tissue they used was also orange  it was the most hideous thing  i almost didnt give it to the person i was so mad
this is definitely one of the best sex shops weve been to and im sure if we are ever in las vegas again we will stop by to see if there is anything new
first of all this is a ride now
i mentioned to the checkout associate that the onsie was on the clearance rack and she knocked that down to 147 too
is it worth it
regulars seemed to get good treatment but i was definitely not given the same
if you look at it you might find the place hasnt been cleaned in days
it feels like a sams club which i hate even more
theyre able to fix my water damaged iphone 6  very happy with the girl helping me
but everyone messes it up
the piercing went really smoothly
randall the owner is always a pleasure to work with
i told angelica what i wanted and she did it i finally found my hairstylist these girls are awesome
they called me right back and said the doctor would get me in
hopefully it continues to bring people back to westgate and bring some business back
if best buy wants to present itself as on integrated store and use the combined onlineoffline presence as a differentiator say between it and amazon it needs to really integrate itself on both platforms and not have different pricing in each
the staff is absolutely friendly and they are knowledgeable
super easy for them to exchange and 100 for a whole front office is  boom
his work is excellent and prices are incredibly reasonable
its a lot easier to shop when the staff are nice to you
literally took about 10 minutes to exchange them for a pair i liked  to top it if he even cleaned my old ones i had with me
they do have promotion with reasonable price
checking the malls website is an easier source of schedules and will usually tell you the theme of each show
love stripes so this is the perfect place to pick up some goodies for yourself
thank you so much for going out of your way to give me a dream dress buying experience
the store looks 12 empty
there was a young shorter woman with dark hair and a young darker gentleman dancing slowly and nuzzling while an older gentleman was standing at the computer
i turned her around and pulled her backwards down two flights of stars
she was extremely patient and her knowledge helped make the process smooth and easy
i immediately called the front desk asking for help
having been a hater enough in this review i would recommend shopping here for your nonperishables
christine is a godsend
i left looking terrible with half wet hair and an angry look on my face
not a beautiful song from a temptress on an island a deafening screach of terror and alarm
i love this store
also had gone to bocca bargoons which is nice but way overpricedalso check the fabric in hobby lobby but there was basically no selection there
tucked away unassumingly in the path it offers a great collection of watches cufflinks etc
so sad very disappointed in them
i was skeptical at first when i left i felt significantly better
they gave me an added discount on the bike and knocked off quite a bit on the final bill ie
who knows why some have had bad experiences and others have had good ones
hands down the best patties in the gta
we will buy from them again
it is worth looking into this store
hasnt anyone ever heard of postit notes
i stopped in yesterday to order for v day
keep in mind my sister picked up 4 of these lipsticks that have not been released yet
the women who work there are my new style gurus
so i go into the store after breakfast and talk with eric
now my favorite part is all the specialty italian items that she has
trust me fridgidair could care less
my first time there and julia butchered my hair
frankly as far as lgss go its my favorite
that stuff is incredible and i also love the fact that this biscotti is doughy
different types of books and with a kids writers workshop in the back
and one of the staff in particular  dont know her name  pretty young wears glasses shes super friendly and funny and will help you look for what you need then have a silly conversation with you about it
if you want people to buy guitars from you
the bartender was great and very courteous not to mention easy on the eyessmart
dr v is amazing
today they were giving samples of sushi which was pretty cool
never have i seen such a variety of different items in one store
he just didnt know how to interact with the group didnt help make the night fun
i bought some strawberries and mangoes  i got a great deal it was the end of the day they looked nice but when i got them home the mangoes were all brown inside
overall this is a great place to spend some time browsing
this time i took it to red sevens who charges less to fix viruses anyway
even if its just a wednesday in august
i also went to boot star and although they had cool boots there the staff never said anything and it made my mother and i feel really uncomfortable so we walked out
been to various shops around town but this is by far the best vape shop
going to pv mall is like visiting your grandmother in a nursing home its nice to see the grandma youve loved your whole life but no matter how well the visit goes theres something depressing about the experience
this stuff has great character its made better than cheap ikea garb and its just straight awesome
she was knowledgable and the prices are awesome
after multiple phases of evolution from counter culturethe downstairs to colab
i was next and i walked up to the counter
i proceeded to return to the shop with my old tube and pliers and asked the owner to please demonstrate to me how it was possible to destroy one of these valves in the manner i had

we met a very nice man named bob

but overall i thought the staff was really nice and efficient

ive been in here a few times and had a normal unmemorable experience what you would expect from any dollar storehowever today i must say that the staff there were not particularly friendlythey were far too interested in speaking with each then assisting customers
now im just filled with anger
first we were to choose from a basic menu we chose barbecue and then could add the sides that we wanted
they seem to be doing quite well though the last time i dropped off stuff i felt like they didnt have a whole lot of stuff in the store to sell probably because everyone bought everything
now i just realized that his good service was due to the fact that he was quick and easy
thank god for those 50 off sales

lot of name brand of stuff that i looked through and i think their stuff is on the higher end for resale clothes

our visit and a fivestar rating was only spoiled by the surly and uncooperative attitude of a member of staff in the cafe who clearly was not interested in our business despite there being 45 minutes until closing time a fact that she reminded us of at least twice and gave off a general air of extreme harassment despite there only being three tables occupied at the time when we asked to see the menu in order to decide if there was anything that we could eat
delivery day arrived
this is absolutely ridiculous
hell help you with whatever you need
i appreciate they took me in even as a walkin despite being busy

though it is a very expensive store the quality of the items and service does make it feel special

they even had a popup bar right in the grassy area

before i knew it he had an installer that agreed to deliver all four appliances first thing in the morning the day i requested
they also validate parking for 90 minutes but be careful twice the machine failed to print the validation bar code and we had to pay for parking
im practically a professional shopper and hold down with the best of them but i was more than a little put off by that nonchalant attitude of oh yes 800 for a razor and stand is no big deal to me
the entire area is going to pot
first off dont go here if you dont like large spaces with a ton of shoes
if you subscribe to the stores mailing list you get even more discounts and exclusive offers
theyre usually giving a coupon at the door
a very good selection of quality cigars and accessories

i was disappointed butit happens
i have to say that genna and sandee are a dynamic design duo
outside of the cooler was an egg cart with half broken eggs that had seeped out of the containers
this place was nice and not overcrowded
this review is based totally on service and i think thats what yelp review of an international chain at individual location should be about service

he brought me different kinds of shoes to try on and provided us with water and beer
they werent his style so we came with the gift receipt to get something else
i will definitely come back when i need another repair
i love bookstores
the only thing that keeps me from shopping at this costco more often than at other locations is the distance from where i live
arent most of them
wellstocked less strange customers and not too many panhandlers in front of the store also located in a strip mall
but im not writing to applaud the ac
worth checking out for yourself if youre in the neighborhood and appreciate the crunchier aspects of life
this place isnt cheapbut buying something here is more like making an investment
we ended up calling our friend who had a sfvegas flight out the next morning

this place is the best
i dont like the crowd during weekend
great little shop with a nice variety of  clothing shoes camping gear etc
chuck used to own it and then he retired and his daughter took over
better to bypass these rude sales people and buy it online if you have to
everything in the store is cute colourful and highly collectible
in the beginning i started buying from this company to try different suppliers out
save yourself from making the horrific mistake i made and doing business here
i didnt know there was a swim shop practically next door to unlv
from the outside it kind of looks like im going to an abandoned warehouse
it was fun checking out the rest of the museum
very rude and has a serious hostile  attitude
walmart is a retail genius in ensuring that they are truly an unbeatable value in most classifications and my local walmart is no exception
if you do this guaranteed you will walk out with the mattress you need and want
bella bridesmaids is awesome
they will also leave you alone if that is what you want
its hard to like or dislike borders
its an okay time
the carpet looks like it was last replaced in 1981 and they must not own a vacuum cleaner
needless to say customer service did not call
yes it is kind of crowded but its two floors of rather cozy and crowded awesomeness

i called a few days after i sent my email because i didnt get any feedback you just have to call and follow up with them to get them moving on your order
one year i was looking for a turkey baster in july common in november due to thanksgiving
i will not be back to this location
i wish they had a albertsons like in california
but i do wish things were better and invoked more confidence in me the adult
so i left the dress and corsetwhich still needed altering for final cleaning and steaming until today the day before the wedding
the facility itself was clean and nice
great place to pick up unique pieces
joe and mary lou are the best and were kind enough to keep the studio open even though we were the only two people to sign up for this particular painting of marilyn monroe
without stopping her curse filled conversation the woman behind the counter just pointed over her shoulder and didnt even make eye contact
i really need to write a full review but just havent had the time so i will second everything in david b
todays cashier was rude to customer in front of me

i dont mean hovering over your shoulder and asking to take your things to your fitting room every 5 seconds
i was in need of a new bedroom set last year and i checked this place out
i went here today for the first time  really enjoyed it

800 customer service
i definitely would recommend buying your mattress here
one woman in particular kept ignoring me when i was complaining
there are old signs from the major hotspots from back in the day when the rat pack ruled entertainment and mobs controlled the casinos
they also have a good selection of clothing and accessories mainly stuff that youd see on the clientele at your skeezier dive punk bars  not really for beardofolk indie geeks like myself
always so helpful
second the staff omg the staff is not good at their jobs
they have various areas in the mall where i could sit almost laid out like a miniliving room  was a great place to chat with other dads  and wallow in agony about being at the mall
being an artist myself i couldnt take my eyes off all the illustrations
for fidget spinners of course
all delicious especially the chicken fajitas
i cant wait to finally get some good rest on my new sealy posturepedic
it was tightened and peened in place
so quit trying to do it yourself or paying big bucks to podiatrist and let these guys do your wolverine toes and maybe your claws
we were never told this when we purchased the shirts
of course he will say hes ok and will keep on going even if his wrists are shattered that is what guys do
if you like it buy it
as a side note the hum thing is terrible
im sure if i was looking for something kinda crazy that i could have found it here but that wasnt the mission i was on
i know they all do dd here as well
eugene loves his craft and it shows in the care he puts into giving your knife that telltale mirror edge of sharpness
this place is hit or miss

please beware and do not buy anything from them
not for just park bike but race street and get to work bikes
disclaimer i love a lot of the merchandise and food in ikea but hate going to their stores to shop
several lowes employees called chris yesterday and chris treated them as if he was lowes ceo himself telling them what he was not going to do it and it was already rescheduled
i love this location
will they still offer the same selection of roses
i compare it to hm in a smaller scale and cheaper cheap lol
first and foremost the reason for this review is the customer service top notch
fortunately it continued to respond to my touch with the added sensation of cutting me albeit on a microscopic level
when we finally were able to see someone they informed me they wouldnt be able to look at my phone for four hours
these guys are what u want in a mechanic willing to help u best fix ur bike
he came to our house on a friday
but he assured me that this was no comparison and the best
ive had a break in my bowling experience and my equipment needed some upgrades
we felt like we walked back in time
today i decided to break down and buy myself a very good pair of running shoes for my upcoming half marathons this fall
if it wasnt for my boyfriend not knowing about my past i probably would have been there for hours and bought a bunch of things i probably would never use
they have a small cafe where i grabbed a salad
they could at least start with high prices and mark them down to make it look like im getting a deal
it really is an uncanny muscular display of antisemitic holiday gusto
love it here
go there thank me later
vs always delivers and i love them
yes they have local dates
and i dont understand why you cant pay for the items to pick up in store
awesome customer service fast efficient cost effective and professional
stop by and buy a ready made garment
this homesense has such a great pet supply selections
after purchasing my first mountain bike from las vegas cyclery i was excited to get out and hit the trails

any who i went back in to htc and waited quite a bit of time to have my nipple checked out because i felt like it was going to fall off
totally recommend this place
i know there are quality shoes there but the whole experience felt like a huge sell job and that trumped customer service in my book
i am very very happy with a new leaf
and trust me no amount of attempted charming or flirting will get you anywhere
i come and see ana she has master and dominated my extremely curly hair
not to mention the pharmacist is good looking
they have much more in stock than a lowes or home depot or than what a small speciality store ll will carry
this company is part of a insurance claim from a flood
one of the few shopping places thats already open at cityscape offering affordable post modern wear i dig it
also did i mention steve and his rad factor
my pedi smudged on the way to the mani table and the lady just painted directly over it clumps and cotton stuck it it and all
a kid 13 to 12 our age helped us out and boy did he know his stuff about dishwashers
today we saw lots of camping equipment tents and chairs some tennis rackets lots of asis electronics some duplo lego blocks and who knows what
i concur with the other reviews here
they carry interesting watches from a range of manufacturers and if you luck out on a sale youll leave very happy indeed
i cant believe how well i see with these glasses and whenever i put them on  i feel very fortunate that i found her
i think that should speak volumes about her talent however ill go on to say that she has literally been gifted by god
im hoping that pubsbars will open soon in dt summerlin
i promise you will thank me
guess when youre paying the millions of endorsements consumers will believenot me ill stick with the asics and new balances
comparing to major game cafes like snake and lattes this place is a lot smaller and less games to choose from
poor service equals poor experience equals i will take my business elsewhere
i also picked out an independantly produced dvd of some local bands that i am excited to check out
after the hair color which turned out great she directed me to nick for the hair cut
it was a fun splurge
cons iffy management at times mediocre mt bike selection middle of the road but they can order higher end bikes for you
i give spurlocks a glowing endorsement
i was nervous to go into a primarily asian salon as i am as white as can be
i was also disappointed with the paintingspicture area
i call my warranty and they confirm  still waiting on approval
what a great couple
super great ingredients everything is perfect
my wife is now friends with a man in his sixties who works there
i feel like an idiot for actually believing him
i know she spent a lot of time on my concerns before we even met
they told me it would not be painful
and how he promised to make things right by me
the apple store  town square offers a nice second addition to the las vegas area located inside one of the best shopping malls in town imho this store is very large and spacious with two large rows of computers and ipods that stretch to the far end of the store where the genius bar and checkout counters are located
and the lowlights werent very darkish since they ran out of the original color i requested and the replacement color was very light
its always crowded with the carts always bumping into each other due to small isle space
a good place for the bare essentials
i have never had that before
i brought in all designer highend pieces  all my pieces were brand new with tags or in likenew condition
mucho kudos to rob first of all showing up right on time courteously calling to let me know he was en route  about how far he was away
i also scored a pair of wall sconces for only five dollars granted they need a little tlc but cmon  five dollars
my makeup lasted all day too
no is there anything else you need or if you are ready to make a purchase please step over here
we came here to look with no intent of buying as we all know everything on the internet is cheaper
if you are willing to dig through the older stuff they have a nice variety of used records where you can find the odd treasures
they were all very through with their work
all in all dont go into the store just use the website for wire
im not sure who i was dealing with unlikely the owner but i asked a couple questions about some of their products that they did not have answer too nor were they friendly or keen to answer
its hard to pinpoint the style of this store
i recently sent an arrangement to a friend who was hospitalized
he was very knowledgable and professional and he took care of everything
yes i realize this may very well be a case of old dognew trick
i really like the fact that this is a straight piercing joint
i need a specialty compound for a thyroid condition and my doctor recommended this pharmacy
part with your lindt bar and you will step into a new world and understand why cacao is revered as a food of the gods
it looks so cozy
walking past their window the selection has always struck me as a bit hoochie mama for my taste but finally i went in
i go here when i in search of a new shirt a purse for my lady some patches whatever it maybe its my first stop
the service is amazing
the card got us into the bar for 650 with a free drink
i like the quality of this location
they got it back quick with no hassles
so if you live or work closeby they will easily fit into your routine otherwise you will question your sense of commitment to local businesses like me
which means if you dont want the temptation of popping into other stores by default see walking back to your car you can come to this hm pop in pop out and not lay eyes on another store save old navy
but the thing that separates this bike shop from others is that when i went to pay my apple pay did not work on their card machine
this is ridiculous as it is small makes no noise makes no mess takes up very little room and is my only means of transportation right now
stopped in on my lunch break to try and get a quick manicure or polish change and was pleasantly surprised that it worked out well
thank you both again
lately ive been trying to strum a guitar
they all handled it well and professionally
but you wont see us there
later that day a friend had called from out of state and had the same cookies delivered to us along with an adorable arrangement of sweetheart roses in a teacup
and the staff and owners are the most delightful people to deal with
you get what you pay for with this place
it makes our lives easier
if you are buying a gift for a friend then you are most likely covered and you will find this a great store
going inside i was met by a holierthanthough girl with blue hair i didnt catch her name but she went on about real cyclist equipment verse poser cyclist things and just in general tried to make certain that i felt bad about myself and she felt superior
for starters i was kind of bummed when my husband switched jobs and my former eye doctor did not accept our new vision insurance
while my painting was not that great and i flubbed on it and had difficulty masking my error i still had a blast doing it
great customer service and owners who really care about literature and the community
they also have a nice variety of childrens and mens shoes
feet stay dry and blister free and are totally worth the price and they last forever
im impressed by the selection of fresh blooms that i imagine are hard to come by in these parts
the majority of the museum is modern art which i personally am not a fan of
horrible customer service
dr burk is awesome and her office staff is so wonderful
the ladies in the optical department gave top notch customer service
ill be sure to tweet out my experience to all of my 12 million followers
mannow talk about huge and realistic
between the 90 minute wait and the obnoxious blaring music it was like a living hell in there
i suppose many companies arent
they have also saved my clients and i a lot of money by covering work andor parts under warranty when i was not even aware the unit still had any warranty
glad i tried ssense
none of them could muster up the courage to speak to the couple directly and maturely so they handled the situation the way children do crying screaming and whining but only when everyone had already gone
and if i cant find what im looking for their staff is always offering to check which stores carry the item or if i can purchase it online
they fixed it free of charge
i correct in wanting to being it back because after i couldnt get my money back i took it home and used the product
after reading the reviews for parking i expected a nightmare
they were able to explain to me the pros and the cons of what i was buying and if it would work for me
if thats the case i stand corrected
however if youre a biggie on customer service this might not be the store for you
within a couple weeks one watch stopped
we had a great experience with shannon and the appliance department of sears
may came still no ring so we call again this time we are told that they are not sure where it was and why it hasnt come in yet and they would track it down and call us
i will never buy anything from this store
great store with parking in front and a variety of gift options
we ordered a table and few things and we asked for their return policy
i was verifying a diamond i bought on the internet
i wanted to walk in there and slap the receptionist if thats what she calls herself for talking to me in a condescending manner
i was immediately greeted asked if i wanted a bottle of water or some tea and everyone was pleased to help with selections  no matter how high up the wall the bolts were
i went to 106 dead shows so this place and area is perfectly normal to me
if youre a fan of gap then this is a reasonable sized branch with a good range of stock and they have a good range of sizes too even though the small ones are still too big for me
i began with the online chat system to ask questions and was helped by ashley clark
after browsing at all of the over priced used items i came across a display of reading glasses with rhinestones on them
they also rent instruments for less than 20 a month
while i was there i was having mic problems with my iphone and they cleaned my mic no charge and were very friendly
kurz und knapp zu hobby foto eine neue kamera kann man dort zu sehr guten preisen kaufenaber beim zubehr ist hobby foto sehr teuer
i wish you sold adult bedroom furniture
its pretty clean and i always see security guards walking around i guess because its close to the train station
they have such beautiful things and are set up just perfectly
she wanted to stand firm
example 300 for a reissue of a misfits album
the prices are affordable as well
the transaction was simple and smooth i will definitely be paying them another visit in the future
an elder lady beat me into the store by like 2 seconds
will be back to buy more mms in the future and any mm related merchandise here if the price is right for me
they have fun events and frequent sales
just two weeks ago i overheard another teacher saying that she was going dress shopping with her mother
it will leave a bad taste in your mouth
der stau reichte ber die essensausgabe zurck bis in den eingang der essensausgabe

places selling polish goods are scattered across the city and leads to me to wonder about experimenting with some polish cuisine some time
for a quick background lululemon sells high end exercise apparel and also fitness lifestyle wear as you call it iewearing yoga pants stylish reflective jackets on an every day basis
they ended up looking great in the pictures
ive been coming here since i was a wee 16 year old  and in all of my experiences there has yet to be a bad one
flavors are ok in store
it all started trying to get there i used my gps on my phone as it led me originally to the wrong side of the street
i called the store today to get the raffle code so i could enter the raffle online and they would not give it to me
also a hawaiian miles mall participant
had an awesome time shopping during lunch
cant beat these prices
this place would be even better if somehow they put a cafe in there
some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not they have modest cute stylish business casual clothes at an affordable price
pure luck extasy and lemon drop are my favorites
he isnt a delivery person
as with any art gallery if youre bringing visitors or children you may want to scout out the content beforehand
look on top of the shelves in the middle of the store or you might miss them though
teleflora is a scam and they contract with third party vendors without relaying specific customer requests or following up to ensure they deliver
the delivery men set up the new fridge and took my old one into the garage as an extra for water etc
the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending
the guys in the shop know what they are doing and are professional
i never go anywhere else
she was polite just seemed unsure
we walked around for a bit but parking is out of control
erik and his team did an amazing job landscaping our front and back yard
after giving up on being greeted properly i flagged one of them down who had little to zero knowledge on any of the appliance product and basically read to me off the signs and the computer screen
i would like to say that i will be back
for such a reputable company their customer service is atrocious
7 golden girls throwbacks are now 14
i would recommend their ccw course to anyone interested in the las vegas area

upon my return on sunday i found the shop to be clean and well organized
she will make your appointment the best day ever and so relaxing
huge thanks ziggys music
im going to hang up and call again and after this im calling corporate
i would definitely recommend his services
love this place
i am a fan of this location of qis
also it is cruelty free and organic
questionable business practice  accepting a purina coupon for scratch and then giving me some unknown brand and telling me you never carry purina scratch and that theyre all the same
they have a stage for concerts and the entire complex was designed with a moroccan flare
btw the place was completed dead
it was packed full of fresh organic local products
we all know how these places are
with all the calls i have made to conns in attempt to get service and then resolution between 713 and now 1005 one callsthen supposedly the call was made on 929 with no message was left and no one called the other number on the account and is the one that is requested to be called are you kidding me
yes i love wally world
each room has a different theme and there are larger rooms in the event you wanted to have a gathering there

i didnt see anything i liked through a quick browse but there was a variety of new dvds

i wasnt sure where to start my adventure

it was a good fast experience
i asked to make an appointment and she never texted back
i head back out to the counter where the same woman who helped me look at glasses is
they say to drop off will take an hour or two  it takes all day
as long as they keep up the good customer service and customize their service to fit my needs then i will continue to shop here
one of my favorite suppliers
stay away from these crooks
food was delivered sporadically and one of our groupies order never came
i recommend renee to everyone you will  not be disappointed
its the kind of place that makes me feel on edge as a parent because my kids cant resist the idea of making a run for it and doing something obnoxious like jumping on the atvs climbing inside a display tent or riding a pillow fishbut never once have they gotten a sideways glance from a bass pro employee
the stylist are friendly and everyone treated me well
dont get me wrong  this is still not made to measure but with some alterations this is some of the best cloth and stitching quality youll get for less than 1000  protip bring your suit for alterations at espinosa master tailor around the corner  hell do the best job for you for about 25 cheaper than what suitsupply will charge you for and give you the most honest opinion you need to make you feel like a million bucks in your suit

they always greet me with a smile
the shop itself isnt bad

take a moment to browse through their shelves  seekers a try great place with friendly staff
ill think twice before shopping here againseriously disappointed
all of this for around 33 of the cost of the original quote
you want stinkweeds
no new patient discount instead they offer buy one get one half off select eighths
a woman employee with short hair watched me walk right out
cost is better than other places i have been to in the past
i have it writing fool
currently doing my divemaster through them and have done every class up to this point with them
5 pieces for 250 that they give you in half a styrofoam clamshell with a couple of toothpicks
its jan 20 2016 now and artemano picked up the phone and they said they will deliver to my place so a week and a half or so i call the store itself but  i just spoke with heartland artemano who told me they will be delivering my item to the toronto warehouse and then deliver it to me
he truly took care of me and kept my finances in mind
you name it and they most likely have it
although i havent tried my new kit yet i am very confident haus  of vine is he place for me to make my wine
although its a little pricey if you ask me
i really like rose she is personable and good at her job
the layouts inside are weird to me and their registers were outdated
i dont think ive ever experienced a shop not returning something
customer service was great
he printed it out and it was completely free
i also like that they have an online ordering system so you can just pick out what you want and pay for it online and then its at the store ready for you
best part of shopping here
victoria can do it all
i also really prefer to go during the week  during normal business hours
lots of parking in the lot but the store could use a good clean up
they reviewed the features of equipment and answered questions after the install
weve been with tmobile 10 years
the break down being 35 and 20 for the actual shirts
you want me to show you
we first purchased our bed from this store and recently came back to purchase 2 new twin sets for our twins
since i needed a lot of work done to the dress being pregnant and all i was anxious to try on the size i had ordered 2 sizes larger than my normal one
i picked up figures there or statues or collectibles for prices cheaper than i could have found online or at other places because the price they has listed was fair not only to them but the customer
the high prices are still high
lastly there are free yoga classes at every lululemon store
ars shot guns etc
if youre looking for something quirky or rare in the world of design or otherwise it is more likely that type will carry it than indigo
the guys who work here are knowledgeable and will spend a great deal of time letting you know what is what
it smelled amaaazing and im almost regretting not getting one myself
they need to continue doing exactly what they are doing because it works so beautifully
i left content with my new stretchy top cargo pants long tops and a massive stack of coupons and samples
i am highly allergic to gold no gold is not hypoallergenic palladium cobalt nickel and a number of other metals that are mixed with fine jewelry pieces to harden the metal
i know that sears is struggling so i try to give them some  every now and then to help the cause
i easily saw 903 i knew the lost leaf was in walking distance
they also have a great selection of nail colors which is pretty rare and the salon is nicely decorated and very clean
im sorry but there needs to be more variety of clothes and more affordable prices
ive gotten several suits through this exact store and no previous problems
the entire process was a wonderful experience they had a very quick turnaround and the end result was perfect and exactly what i was looking for
this place sucks
i never have a problem with finding an item in stock
i was charged 72 for tailoring the dress
i paid a lot of money for professional color and didnt get what i wanted
survive these places are thriving
it just goes to show that a good camera crew can make things appear any way they want them to for tv
last time i went into this mall i spent a good two and a half hours entered womens stores ranging from the cheap and trampy forever 21 to the classy professional ann taylor tried on dozens of dresses and tops and left with a grand total of a few pairs of leggings
just as we walked up to the display of furry bears one of the young employees came up to us brought us a talking ted coffee mug and started to show us the features and sell us the mug
i may have been approached by the manager or assistant manager
i know this place is not that expensive but id rather pay more for someone to give me exactly what i want
after years of filling my prescriptions and making thousands of dollars off me
the staff was unbelievably helpful in helping us find pants in his tricky size 30x34 and making sure we never needed help but also not being pushy
o and we can all use a little break here and there these days
usually well stocked and clean
the eye drs and front desk manager were excellent with my 9 year old
most of all i really appreciate the careful quality work that is performed
i was excited to get my first tattoo and decided to come here since the reviews were so great
i was also told that the order would be sent out the same day
i too also highly recommend this company
i bought the ring but luis warned me it had a loose diamond very close to falling out
i also recommend this place to interior designers  decorators as this is a place to get cheap items and revamp them to your taste
the rep was 1000 times worse than car salesmen seriously take my word for it and dont do any business with them
david showed us many items we would need and helped us fill our basket
i highly recommend camelback flowershop
the previous 3 days i was in seattle and my coil burnt out
i ordered a poster through the staples website to be picked up at this location
i found a soda stream bottle set for 18 on clearance
she has given us a new delivery date another two weeks out
customer service sucks
i decorate cell phone casesso im definitely here a bit too often this is where i can get em at 5 a piece
then to imply that most of your business is dedicated to online sales and in the same breath say that the customers that call arent as important as the ones in your store
in my whole lifetime of driving this has never happened to me after an oil change
on a more positive note they still have instore live music performances
i loathe shopping here
marina is the perfect balance between these two things
ive been going to tempe eyecare for over a decade and continue to be impressed by their level of care
they should have dialed these in closer than that
had no luck unfortunately
i wish they were open a little later and that they would open more lanes when needed thats what theyre there for
they will also disassemble and let you keep the old parts that are still good if you opt for a new vacuum
there are no mountain bikes here
they do afternoon tea but japanese style so picture your favorite british tea sandwiches with a kick of wasabi and slice of asian pear
they are a market fun toybook shop coffee bar healthy diner all in one
i have to say this store has a huge selections of boots
it took me almost 20 minutes to check out
i was here over the weekend helping a friend look for a wedding dress
this place is amazing
worst customer service in the store and on the phone
nothing bad to say about this location what so ever
these guys produce and inventory some of the coolest bikes youll ever see
look at all this dust
2 customer service is impeccable
of course he cant receive the flowers  sign for it
so far no other store was as good of a franchise
they both were consummate professionals and true artists who take pride in their work
i must admit that i love apple products and it is very difficult for me to write a negative review about apple
also on one of my trips they didnt explain to my niece and nephew to wipe down the piece before painting it
im really happy with my piercing and nick was great to work with
his work is amazing
i will definitely pass this location next time
the quilts on the walls were so pretty and it seemed like they had a pretty good selection of patterns and kits
i advised her that dd wanted the other print
he is an american hero
the first delivery was scheduled and we were told that the headboard was broken for the king and would have to be sent another time
like a few other people mentioned there really isnt much for sale
the last time i was there valentines day the shelves were fully stocked this time totally empty so call ahead as they dont seem
one of my favorite things to do is take the day off from work in the middle of the week and come down here and stop in at the little bakeries and shops here
the mim is a museum everyone should see whether theyre just visiting arizona or live there
couldnt ask for a better place to get a good deal on a towel warmer
obviously not good for the bottom line
if they tell you 15 minutes expect an hour
not impressed wind not impressed at all
add in the fact that they have decent prices on wine as well and quantities of beer containers you simply will not find here 60 pack are you serious
go go go
thank you rosa
what i really like besides the service is the variety of items they carry eg clothing hair accessories socks jewellery wigs purses shoes
they only gave us 1 month of what they owed us
i hate it from the congestion in the parking lot to the congestion in every single aisle inside the store
one of the new pbs channels is all about cooking sewing etc
seriously i kid you not
they also have boxes of chocolates chocolate covered fruits and square cakes in 12 or 24 pieces
i have made this my primary pharmacy
i buy one everyday just to sleep with
and you have to pay for delivery
we ended up buying way more than we ever intended but were happy to do so because the prices are reasonable relative to the really excellent quality
nice location nice store
we had a totally positive experience with troys tree service
the best salon experience i had ever had was at his arcs salon in las vegas so i had high hopes
might as well buy from china websites since customer service is horrible
owner nick refuses to respond to emails and provide refund for work not done
i made him get them out of the trash
top quality equipment top quality service
this is the most magical pun intended store ive seen so far on the strip
ok if i could give this place 0 stars i would
hes pretty keen on suiting quality too
they stood there silent not saying a word and just looking down
if she had not been here this day my opinion of this store would have been much lower
within only about half an hour we found my sisters dress
based on those factors this  would never be my first choice for grocery shopping
i couldnt believe it
the fact that they replaced these pieces without trying to make a dime off me shows that they care about their customers
silvana and tim both helped me
they did not turn out to have anything i needed but it was a pleasant place
dr steger was great and i would recommend him to everyone
this past winter we tried indoor gardening for the first time and purchased a grow light system from paradigm
great price great availability
you can tell that hes fully bought in to his company and for good reasonthey are the best
detour salon is modern relaxing and clean
as i am familiar with ulta from my time in san diego i knew that they do the salon services
i literally just wanted my 32 back

so the people at this sprint store couldnt actually help me with my problem but they were friendly enough and about as knowledgeable as you might expect
hung up called again same girl picked up asked for the sku and took forever to check
very fast and very professional service
i spent almost the entire day trying to call the store to rectify this sometimes i would get a fax tone other times i would get no answer at all
husband and i came in to register here late one evening after having already registered over at babies r us earlier
preislich bewegt sich der laden aber im oberen segment
let me say this it is way better then sams club
we asked if the installer could go and get the required part i am not a contractor and dont know the proper part
the only reason im giving them one star is because they have a great assortment of tuxedos in many sizes for a cheap price
importantly tamara asked about budget and stayed within it which turned out to be a saving grace because i was not able to tell the difference between her si2 and the vs1 i saw at the other shop twice the price
free wifi great place to work when your office is getting too dull and super close to epic
i must have raved to her to my husband the next two days and my husband as bad as he was dreading helping me find a new phone he said how cool it was that terra remembered me and treated us and got us in and out of there with total class
i left pleased
even more than that and rarest of all they are good at taking individual customers aesthetic preferences into account once theyve learned what those preferences are
she was very kind and told me it was no problem and i dropped off the fabric and pattern to her and she said shed have it ready by my date that i needed it which was in about 12 days
about 3 years ago i went in to get some copies made and had a great experience that was once and 3 years ago
now pick up is what works for me and i find the closest store to my destination
he was able to fix a dc power jack that had come unsoldered from the motherboard of my acer laptop for a fair price and get it turned around for me same day
i love how these are set up
however i was forced into a situation where i got my first bike and i had absolutely no idea about bike maintenance or riding rules x the guys at trailhead were extremely helpful and let me ask a plethora of stupid questions i already should have known the answer to like can i ride on the sidewalk and is it stupid for me to ride 5 miles in 115 degree temps
my husband and i have had a sleep number bed for over 20 years and were needing a change due to many aches and pains upon waking every morning
interest piqued by their excitement how much did i enjoy juniper breeze
there are stairs leading to the second level a child walking up commented on how high the stairs were but she was maybe four or five years old
they contribute to the ambiance but i cant see myself actually buying any
super cute accessories
unfortunately when you purchase from the prada outlets in europe they do not stamp your authenticity cards
they really are about customer service would definitely recommend them
floor associate not helpful or focused cashiers not personable  poor management messy store very disorganized  wont be returning
you can try on anything and everything
drug my boyfriend here to grab an apple cider slushie and look at the nice views for five minutes
im so over the handbags
i would avoid going here unless you want to see the most amazing bicycle shop youre ever seen in your life youre looking for specialty items or you dont have the means to pay for your dominatrix anymore and you need to be punished by a stranger
all because they had to input a copay card that i was told to bring when i picked up my rx
matts wrinkle cream may be the best kept secret
the employee who was responsible for all this mess was fired
i will be back again
this place is behind the main buildings from the main street
the two girls at the store were very helpful
they trimmed the tree down and made sure that we were happy with the overall appearance of it
so this is just a general rating and tip  would have expected a replacement pair or store credit or maybe even a free lunch card for having to bring in a pair of glasses for repair that i have only wore three or four times
cindy mentioned that they are having a printers fair on saturday october 31 2009 i  definitely plan to check it out as it looks like there will be many opportunities to try out the cool letterpress equipment and find out about upcoming workshops or buy equipment and type

i follow them on facebook too for the latest buying trips photo shoots diy workshops at bicyclette etc
i headed straight over to their food aisles to see whats different than the us  i spotted lots of cool things like dunkaroos vegetarian rice krispies treats and cereals like vanilla rice krispies
i love this stuff
the perfect ring was made
you are treated very well and you get a little taste of the high life while you are there at a price
we are brazilian and first time in montreal we loved the store
and if you havent yet then be sure to sign up for their rewards program
i wish they were  lil less pricey that being said i live in the pacific northwest most of the time in a place surrounded by shops like this so i am sure the supply vs the demand thing falls into effect here
they came 2 hours after
i am a stay at home local who just wanted my money back
decisions decisions there seems to be something for everyone with a wide range of prices and levels of expertise required

the staff was friendly and upbeat
terrible communication and a general pain in the ass
return factor  80
i spent almost 2 hours with these people while they were trying to trouble shoot it
this place it top notch
such a welcoming experience that you never get at other salons
they are outstanding

two weeks ago i ordered some brochures online for my business to hand out at a huge event
so i had to go back to their location and chase them to get my money back

thats right ladiesno more getting notes from your doctor to have those kinks worked out of your lower back while youre pregnant
a smileinducer if every there was one
just from an outsiders view this place needs to get the staff under control it was poorly managed and everyone was rude
which wouldnt be an issue is they left others alone
dave was apologetic and said we havent had time to get to your car yet
for example rip  only there are 7 different names on the car
on this floor a change room is never far and  you can spend a lot of time checking out the latest arrivals as well as combing the sales racks

this is a typical walgreens store that provides that quiet atmosphere while catering to most of your everyday needs
my favourite store in the city
when i got to the counter i realized i had forgotten my credit card at home but the guy helped me get rung out without it i was a little annoyed they needed my social security number and they had me write it down on a piece of paper but then after i got rung up he gave me the piece of paper back
i talked to a supervisor and manager and he acknowledged my frustration and that they were also at fault
big bright clean good selection and decent prices
same old dusty pieces with the same sky high prices
unfortunately theres an angry old man that sometimes works the cafe area
they never did a temperature test
poseidon himself would be impressed
but the best part of the phoenix art museum is the installation you who are getting obliterated in the dancing swarm of fireflies
i also noticed some were made in afghanistan and others in turkeya trip downstairs led to the more affordable rugs equal in design but inferior in quality

well thats how i felt as a high schooler going to shop for cds and things there anyway
on a rack theyll put 5 but only on one side so the other side could cost 30
the wait was about 15 hours
they stay fully stocked with just about everything for every sport
they gave me a deal for shampoo and conditioner and also referred stylists
they are so nice at the store to sell you something but thats it
ive been going to neutral since it was just tim working on dumpster bikes in a garage that was falling apart
easy to find what you are looking for and helpful friendly staff

friendly staff as well
just today i found out that we are still being charged for the coffee machines that we have not had in our possession for over half of a full year

how is it possible for a small business to keep its door open when it has repeated poor reviews
my first impression was the nice and wonderful greetings from staff
when i got there i told them that there was an arrangement i had seen on line that i loved
a couple young guys running their own businesses and doing an excellent job they should be applauded
all the staffs were just typing away on their keyboards without making any eye contact
my wife and i have been here a few times and keep coming back because it is way too fun
need to hang out with some buddies
ive always taken great care of my smartphones
and friendly employees who are right there ready to help you find whatever you need
home depot is still decent for some purchases when you know what you are getting
its definitely one of the best tj maxx stores ive been to as well as a home goods
there were 2 employees as you walked in and 4 throughout the store all of which wanted to eagerly assist and it was a bit overwhelming
prices are reasonable beautiful furniture lots of different booths and a super cool tiki section
i especially like to shop for gifts there because i can always find something for the amateur chefs in my life
they have a massive selection and the prices are decent
i was wrong
the inconvenience i had isnt worth it
this is highway robbery
if anything this babies r us inventory is pretty good but the store practices are rotten more about that later on
i was amazed at the money they got for it
i was wandering around the store looking for a few items and quite sure i looked confused so instead of ignoring me he came up and helped me find what i was looking for
its where i buy all mine
ill only be back if cayla is working
design is how it works
i believe the shop owner also owns undftd a few blocks away its right next to stussy

i have heard many people say that walking in the door is actually quite intimidating because its a small shop and more than likely everyone that works there will look at you the second you walk in the door
they had enough materials on hand to get started right away and they not only gave me some options but also had some great suggestions on how to make it really pop
seriously wheres the security crew in this plaza

if it still had the arcade itd be awesome
i was wrong to suggest this place dont go there go to the corporate stores where they know what theyre doing and they actually have honest people
approach the park from george the fourth bridge and youll find a host of street performers ice cream and hot dog sellers to some delicious eateries like neals yard
they had a vast array of products on display and working
the only thing that i personally dont care for a ton about this store is the parking lot
then she set another deadline for me getting the contract that passed with no word
at 952 they already locked some of the doors so we had to go to a different exit
yes 98 of the people who work their act unhappy to be there and wish you would just take what they give you be happy and go away
there is also a buffet that consists of fresh fruit and various brunch items
the whole experience cost 50 dollars plus tax and tip and for what you get it was not worth it
best of luck to the store but you lost a loyal customer
no rush no pressure sales

my only complaint is that although the location was interesting and left plenty of room for walking the lot is very old and has some very dangerous potholes one with a drain that was barely flush with the pavement anymore and looked as if someone could kick it off exposing a large hole and a steep incline in the shifted concrete pavement that my mom almost tripped over while preoccupied with the booths

i had thought they would just use my current contact prescription because it isnt an old prescriptionstill current however they did not let me know that they would have to run another exam for contacts and they of course didnt let me know that it would cost extra
so not only is this a cashier fail on her part not giving us the correct information this is also a failure on ikeas part for not providing clear signage or notification on the receipt that you need to place your order after youve paid

i ended up finding this place off yelp
completely unwilling to help and only responded with sarcasm
the staff are helpful

my experience was few months ago when i went for brazilian blowout
it has average selection of back stock comic books and limited supplies bags boards boxes because its focus on toys

the previous posters comments rang true to my experiences there although maybe not quite as bad
i bought the softest leather brown booties on sale here
they have so many selections of teas and each of their staff are so well trained and knowledgeable about their products
this happened to me two times at this location so from now on i always go to the one on chandler blvd
additionally you can easily get a few good years out of their chinos polos and jackets
and from what i can tell they have all of their teeth
a day in the life is just not enough if you make a stop to the royal ontario museum
i had the spinachmushroom pizza  mediter
the chapel we got married in i believe it was the traditional one it is quite small and it was beautifully decorated for christmas

this practice makes no sense to me
the staff is kind and the sale section right when you walk in is usually stocked up pretty well
theres two small businesses that cater to these students but dont expect anything close to the arizona center
staff bends over backwards for their patrons and it feels like one big family
when i first walked into total wine i was in awe
these clowns in the store are clueless
this one is ghetto
to pick out 5 i wanted to try on
the staff at the desk in the middle are really helpful in finding specific books upon request
literature galore i love it
i was there primarily for the machine guns but with their selection of pistols rifles and shotguns i wound up shooting far more than i had planned
i was asking myself what is next in store for me a  super hard sales pitch

she said its the bundle and it includes screen protector case car charger and another gadget that we like
they only had my new trail running hiking shoes in this semi ugly puke green color but they make my knees feel oh so supported i could run in them all day

this place is the worst

david is a chatty elderly guy he told me predictably that kids should still be learning latin in schools not playing as much basketball
there is some artwork hanging on the walls and on display behind glass cases

actually because of these fine people and the customer service and expertise i am not going to have to cancel my daughters first trip to disney so thank you all so much

petsmart dicks and marshalls are the only ones left
so you keep searching
no matter i shall not be intimidated by silver salesmen
i went ahead and paid the same man to go pick it up as it went with a set but my concern for future customers of this establishment is that if this owner doesnt stand behind a mistake that her employee makes in fact makes the employee pay out of their own pocket to bring an item to the client then she the owner is definitely not going to stand behind any item in her store because she is to concerned with the immediate sale and not the future of what the customer could bring to her business
although she didnt carry the dress or designer i was in search of she attempted to help me locate the dress and gave me some great pointers
however they said they would call around 1pm to give a 30 min time window
also i walked by and the mod didnt know how to communicate with a guest language barrier and she actually pulled out the google translator to communicate with them
the older salespeople are the only ones who seem hard at work
there were definitely some nice holes and while this fairways were sort of burnt brown what do you expect from arizona in august at 107 degrees
in the evening there a plenty of excellent restaurants to visit my personal favourite being hendersons bistro which serves great food at prices which are suprisingly low for the area
praise for god and fifi and of course susanne
jaelen was professional and sweet just great
loved this particular location and spot

never called us to come back showed up 2 hours later just to be told they were passing on everything
i contacted steve he came out and we discussed everything i wanted done to the house including new roof new gables new front porch new front door repair and restore casement windows etc
theyre a half hour away from my house but im more than happy to make the drive
so for that it deserves a solid blah 3 stars
i was able to just show the cashier the coupon and she was happy to apply it to my purchase
it doesnt charge up to 5 times and is cheap looking
it is much more modern clean and masculine in feel
customer service at this location is extremely rude
the staff are extremely helpful and the atmosphere is always welcoming
let me tell you we enjoyed all of it
he does a great job of communicating with his customers and i would highly recommend him to anyone looking for top notch pool service that offers more than just chemicals and weekly cleaning
i picked one other of their listed flavors vanilla buttermint and decided id try to create my own
i do wish they would offer online shopping as the previous location did
when i asked if i could order a cheaper brand they insisted i make another complete eye exam before they would allow me to switch brands

i work at a hotel in the area and our regular florist was not available for a last minute guest request
i work in customer service so i  appreciate when i get treated good
awful customer service awful staff one girl sat and rolled her eyes when i explained my problems when i was visiting this store
friendly staff and great prices too

they came out and stitched it up
the prices are great and the workers are very knowledgable and helpful
its a decent target
my husband even loves coming here to pick up sexy things for me
i will be switching to any other valley sams or discount tires
not a trustworthy company
there are worse ways to spend an afternoon
andy and i came here recently to get prescription glasses from the results we apparently really needed them
there is such a wide variety and the prices are reasonable
i had three words for him cheap good eats

everything is dirty and disorganized
i finally purchased the damn things and walked away relieved and frustrated as contradictory as that is
she ended up teasing my hair and put so much hairspray in it i couldnt get my fingers through it
i fear that at any second i will be taken down by an army of marionettes
its not huge like the smithsonian but its certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones
it is a relic that serves salisbury steaks and chocolate malts i still dont understand malts
then i was there for the iphone 5s launch waited since 430am with about 150200 people in front of me
i will definitely be back again to look around when its not christmas time and the store is less crowded
i went at 11pm and i still had to wait i dont think ive ever seen a more miserable cashier
the other owners not so much
tchotkes books candles gift wrap artwork and so on
they also offer a good selection of pastries and desserts
ich finde die preise sind eher teuer ungefhr media markt niveau die auswahl ist mager videospiele kommen nicht am release neuere tv modelle fehlen usw und das personal ist nicht grade kompetent je nach abteilung dafr aber recht nett
i know its the end of the day but im still a customer
not a normal one or two year contract a 5 year contract
they dont have a transparent buyingtoselling price ratio like other stores do but it is certainly well below 50

she started raising her voice with me and said i can talk to the manager if i have a problem but shes very busy with tons of customers and ill have to wait
this was difficult
excellent customer service both online over the phone  in person
however a few mishaps that are worth mentioning
save on shipping by coming here and they dont have it they will ship it to you for free
there is a variety of types of clothing and styles but sometimes i have to admit that they style does not always fit with the present fashion and sometimes i find it hard to go in there and find some nice clothing

today my wife wanted some matching earrings so we went back to this store
midnight came much too soon

i can call her and email her exactly what i need and she goes out of her way to make sure we have everything we need even as far as to take time to order products out of the catalog if its not in the store
i have actually taken a  minute out of my day to google that because i dont know who they think they are
the associate was wonderful and kind to work with and i am really happy with the service i received
the massage was advertised as a foot spa and it was certainly much more than that

got it home one of chairs had a defective part
the only strange thing and i hesitate to call it strange since we were the ones walking to walmart in the middle of the night was an employee on break playing a video game and talking to himself
they have a really nice little cafe too its always busy
thankful this place is near my house
good way to kill time in vegas if in the area
the knowledgeable staff make the difference for me
shoes are always legit service and response times are fast shipping is super quick and prices are almost always slightly below market value

a lot of people say customer service is horrible here but really
its a great place to do just that though ive never tried to sit inside during the colder months so im not sure how crowded it gets
i asked what happened expecting the guy to say they didnt have enough business to warrant keeping it but he said it was more due to the fact that the store was so big and they only have like 1 person in there at any given time so it was hard to keep tabs on people drifting around in there
coming back again
i dont want anyone to have to go through the same bad experience
ive bought a couple items from here and never had an issue with customer service till tonight

their gift shops were also very interesting
that young lady has no idea just how they were gonna spend on gifts
as others have already mentioned the dresscode for the waitresses here leaves little to the imagination but i figure that isnt my choice to make
they have no backup system like using the government form
a 20 restocking fee on an off the shelf item is unrealistic
they open at 9am though not 6am as listed here in yelp
this has better booze and fancier food

this place is definitely downtoearth and as a plus when youre done with your hair you can go buy makeup

the place didnt have a look of being in the process of offloading their remaining stock in fact extra stock was spilling out onto the pavement and into the parking lot outside the storefront

we were looking for an inexpensive model since most of them were sold out online

wife and i had been researching windows for well over 12 months

im a novice mountain bike rider but i wanted to upgrade to a full suspension bike
this place is a joke after canceling the order and trying to cancel the credit card the lady hung up
still a great selection but not always worth the hassle to come in to the shop
like they used to
the girls who worked there were very unprofessional
this isnt a spot for those looking for murals and walls found in other cities  ie
i have worked with bike shops and mechanics for over 20 years in southern california

i like this location
the only qualms i have are the labels for each bottle are very very small and the organization is lacking but for a place that has over 50 types of cider and flavoured beers at cheaperthanmostsoda prices as well as a few bottles of rare sodas in their nonalcoholic section it cant be beat
definitely a 5 star you will be well taken care of
and a bargain room

he did an excellent job on my carpet highly recommended
the store the management the cleanliness of the store is just horrible my only positive comment is the prices are great

if you are a private pay like me and you have a choicego with integrity
thank you to the polite blonde employee who tirelessly looked for a shirt i was looking for
truly impressed with this company
the owner is a nice man who clearly has a passion for darts  and televisions for that matter
they have a nice store front display and its in a decent location
now the reason i gave it a 3 star review is their staff
this can be seasonal and not always available
but i was going to go in and buy a new mattress but upon pulling up the worker inside was laying on a mattress texting right in front of the window
she and her assistant are both very pleasant and take pride in their work looking exceptional
if youre looking for cute tea pots nice wines and a stick of salami drive to a world market

i asked juliet to come up with something i could give each client at a mother daughter afternoon tea held at the four seasons
the refrigerator seems to have a mind of its own and stops working or the ice misses the ice bucket and falls to the bottom of the freezer compartment
and the biggest surprise was the price
but they also have other stuff like music collectibles and tv series sets seinfeld etc
the only thing i dont like is when you apply online for credit
after we stared talking about concealers  she was recommending me a variety of different ones i should try
the service was great and the staffowners are exceptionally helpful in finding whatever you are trying to create
and so i was worried about scarring my near perfect countenance
and i didnt even have to explain why i needed it they steered me to corral boots
and everyone is so friendly
admittedly some of the mark up prices will have you questioning if the shop is worthy of the second hand label some are a little expensive but nonetheless you may one day take heed of this advice and find a bargain
when they have seasonal clearance on activewear its usually heavily discounted if you can make it at the right time
the guy here is a total jerk and could care less about helping anyone with their phone or their plan
my ipod several years ago had crazy battery problems and this store solved it by giving me a new one while other stores just told me that i should just change the settings i had tried everything there was

ironically i gave my change to a charity posted inside no frills so had no money for the meter
for instance a large fiberglass planter for 766
i live next door and shop here almost daily
the only thing i thought was cool was a couple obscure punk cds in the music section but i already had the albums on my ipod
if you looking for a great place to store your stuff i cant recommend this place enough
i need some sights put on a glock 19 and work done on the gas system of my ar15 pistol
timings are on the hour and it is very busy right now during the holidays so if you have a 2 pm or 3 pm entry time  you may not get in until 230 or 330  this is especially important for those who want to see the exhibit just before closing
only bad thing that kind of freaked me out was that i got a little bombarded by the staff didnt have a lot of time to think about what i wanted just went from product to product
please ask for alonso he was great
ok so aside from 2 walls of corsets in lots of sizes there are shoesboots kinkwear and stripperwear even a little gothwear
the staff and owner were all friendly  one of the ladies painted my 2yearold nieces toes and hands without a problem
i was extremely impressed
i am very pleased with the results and will be back to see her
the shopping center is too much work for a quick stop but definitely a great option if you have time to spend dining and shopping for awhile
consumers stay away from this location the retail service and approach to customer service is terrible
and lo i came upon yelp who recommended nicks
please keep her around
the best part of custom framing is there are so many choices and options you can spend hours looking and arranging to find what you like
a small selection of wooden frames which were breathtaking
and some meat from the impressive meat and seafood place  the guys are pros and everyone at the mkt seems to take pride
once your tour is over you can shop for some souvenirs or some snacks at their store but waityou say you wanna see more vintage signs
there is a great selection and you name it then you can probably find it in here
that way i could at least stop wasting my time trying to get money back
the pricing is pretty decent and since youre not waiting on shipping totally acceptable
i had to drench it in the watery gravy the waiters were constantly cleaning up our plates as we were finishing each meal
they would not even give me any credit at all for trade in so i could get a better cable
mms for 10
the prices are very fair
shoutout to the doorman
this costco is a zoo on weekdays or weekends
the extent of the customer service was them directing us to the shelf where the skates are located but obviously the guy doing that knew nothing about the different brands or models and didnt even want to help looking for sizes as he walked away and quickly went back to his conversation about the nfl playoffs with another employee
forget the second hand charity bookshops you may know this charity bookshop has set a new standard
they have everything

i took my phone there on saturday
i noticed a whole stand full of cheap batteries but they werent any brand id ever heard of and ive fallen into the trap of buying cheap batteries before and they wouldnt even power my tv remote
so no collecting points from shopping here
fortunately before i ordered i decided to check outlet pc and not only did they have the part in stock but it was only 24
such a fun place
one star taken off for lots of scrappy clothing that is way overpriced and confusing as to why they even accepted it from sellers
we were not sleeping well on the first mattress we picked so we exchanged it for another one that was an equal value with no problemsthe employees assured us that if we still did not like this second choice that we had another full 30 days to bring it back and exchange it for another

one of these days
i agree completely
but you know whatthere is something quite nice about watching them run around after me

most of the stuff i find are expensive and the sales were crap
alex even surprised us by having a permanent crease put in the pants
harpers are clearly not man enough to stand by there words and workmanship
over all everyone here is pretty friendly and answer all your questions in the range or in the store front
very disappointed and will not be shopping at best buy at all going forward

if i could put no stars i would
i finally landed on a nice beretta and it felt perfect

they came in the wrong color the same wrong color again
but walking around checking this and the full size fridge i came upon a 35 cu tf mini fridge with green tag marked down and is damaged
it did not and they charged me 468   still waiting on managers call back
just because i dont look hoity toity doesnt mean im now in there to purchase anything
they buy trade fix phones and they have a wide selection of cases and accessories
they have a great selection of items whenever i am in a pinch
i didnt have a very good experience there overall and i feel it was for their lack of communication and customer service and for that they loose 2 stars
i havent been talked to like that since i was in elementary school
have gone out of their way many times to help repair my kids rc cars
it has a frozen food section and your typical needinapinch grocery items with a few trendy offbrands worthy of exploring

it seems like a lot of the low ratings in the past mention no seating
this bed would be triple the price anywhere else

the rosariums roses are the most perfect ive ever seen  theyre huge and come in so many varieties and colours

if youre looking for amazing christmas or birthday gifts for people in your life youve found them
i heard that solutions just opened up on the lower floor of empress where staples used to be
my wife had an automobile failure disaster while travelling through las vegas
you will always know when there is an artist or writer here the parking lot is packed

how do i know
this happy happy joy joy scam didnt stop after we left the store
so i made my way to this location

while the neon museum might seem to be off the beaten path it is something that i would highly recommend doing
after dealing with the office after several times and catching them signing a contract in my name i was told that they would contact the loaning company and cancel everything and that i could find something elsewhere
definitely make this store your first dress shopping stop in vegas
they turned off the lights in the lighting store
and instead of getting all 4 replaced at once decided only to get my favorite two
to say i wasnt pleased is an understatement
their prices are fair to the extent that i never feel the need to look online for something cheaper
did i feel dirty and ghetto after i left
i dont expect u to constantly wear a smile but dont talk to your customers like they are idiots
bright and early saturday i should up
shawn was helpful made me feel at ease
will not be going back to this store
my only two issues with him were 1
they just took it and said sorry
ive also noticed the department stores have the classics out of stock quite a bit in my size
later on i came up to the cash and the twit chatted with another coworker martin  ignoring the fact that i needed to be cashed out
as ive said before this wasnt our first time in a sex shop and weve had workers talk about vibrators and wands before but she was making graphic gestures of the placement and literally acted like she was using it

this is the only store that carries the flavour i like hence im a customer for life
ok ok how amazing can flowers be
im quite familiar with makeup and taught myself a lot a few years ago but i went with a friend who wasnt and wanted to learn how to really do it right
i chose this office strictly because of its location and my insurance
upstairs  this is more expensive and gallery like
this prices are typical for a shop like this slightly overpriced but within reason
i would totally come here and bring my friends
so when it happened i had no clue what to do
i think i might just go back and get my phone and find another repair shop thats a bit pricier but will at least get the job done on time
this is the best phone repair shop in lv in my opinion
the quality of the roses were poor
dryer runs great again
when they do the employee is moving at a snails pace so the wait seems to be longer here
then it went down hill
i was so mad i said nothing
they also mix challottes with the rice too giving it a really nice flavor
and it just went downhill from there
much more relaxing than last chance
turns out they do have cash on hand for refunds it wasnt a problem at all the manager was just unprofessional and rude
i try again this afternoon and after no less than 5 voicemails telling me my prescription is ready and a call last night  its not ready

the clerks and management here are clueless they mess up more than they actually fix
id say go in look around but dont waste your money on their clothes
this place is a gem
nothing different about it but the fact that its the first active outside of cali
however the availability of product is like ordering from a highend furniture store in that some items can take 2 weeks or longer and the sales staff do not tell you this until after youve signed the contract
we could not beat the value of the products they carry nor the customer service
professional and caring
they completely understood even though its probably not what they wanted to hear but no one treated me like an inconvenience or made me feel bad for my decision
yep i like the tech gadgets and this is the place to shop
this is obviously a generalization there was one informative and respectful guy but i think he was the cz rep and didnt actually work there
everyone here is very friendly and helpful even when they are slammed with customers
they told me it wasnt the same but it was similar it wasnt even close
the only thing really lacking here is the food court its very limited on eateries
they  delivered it when they said they would and it looks great
if you dont know anything about the film that you carry maybe consider not carrying any film at all

best customer service ive ever had and also gave me recommendations that were to a t of what i described
one asks me if i need help and i explain im there to pick up a special order part he says ok and proceeds to put his hands in his pockets and talk to the girl attending to the pallet

no one is overly friendly nor attentive and to be honest though i could spent a lot ofmoney there i just feel like they dont care
my girlfriend wouldve know if she had actually attended us
we have been so impressed not only with the quality of food weve had but also the service and company from all the people that work there

by the end i knew i had chosen the right pair of glasses and was even offered a free sample of contacts lenses top it all off
at this store the employees just want to make a sale so if you arent sure about something take a photo and send it to a friend for an honest opinion
theres a door that leads directly into the sleepy poet
love to do some grocery shopping on the late night
do not go there
when i go in this particular time the lady working in the front is asked a question by the customer im watching since i love to people watch anyway and the second he turns his head shes rolling her eyes and huffing and puffing
they always give me the best service and always have top quality meds to choose from
last year this event was held in downtown las vegas on fremont street this year sunset park was its destination and the crowd seemed to enjoy this mostly because of the ample parking and more outdoorsy vibe

because they think their own products are ugly
she seemed so happy to get rid of another stupid customer
i come to get my hair done seasonally and their product selection is perfect
our guests had an amazing time and i would certainly do this again next time we have to entertain out of towners
i also find it cramped compared to the wide open spaces that their competition has worked hard to create
instead i was rummaging through the sales and clearance items
california pools was quick to point out that the work was not done correctly originally and has agreed to fix the problem
this place really goes above and beyond
also the initial training is carried out in a small pool at one of the trainers residence and it gets very crowded to fit all those people
however the stock consistently looks to change based on what i overheard while therethat is customers donating books were asked to wait a half an hour because of a rush of books and a busy staff

i dont feel any pressure to make our wedding or floral arrangements any bigger or better than i had originally intended
what i got was a full exam by someone who gave a damn about my eyes and someone who was able to piece together a history of my surgeries and my eyes

theyve recently modified their line to the wait in line until the next cashier is available method which really only means that they have customers corralled sideways along the registers instead of behind them which makes the lines seem shorter

long story short end result depends on the person who takes care of you
she mentioned she had made them more arched to bring more attention to my eyes

they dont accept returns on accessories
you can guess the restthe color wasnt right more blue than black
do not make me come up there

unless you have boobs and a pair of yoga pants on
if you know for sure what size you are because youve been professionally fitted then im not sure how the experience would be
it has something for everyone and i can see myself returning here again and again when im in the downtown area
tower city center could have lots going for it
i slightly blame the company on this one because most of these people make minimum wage and they do not get any sort of bonuses or commission off sales
the follow through and follow up was over the top
i found myself doing doubletakes at all the price tags
that is how i found my dining room table
we found out this is up to the discretion of the store owner on a daytoday basis
i hope so
i brought a tv there the same day

how come such low ratings
tons of great finds and they always wrap things beautifully
they surpass anyone in grocery for best customer service
i pick an ace for knowledge and helpfulness bc there is enough of them around i can be picky
clean well organized prices are comparable to any other adult store
dont go to this store ever they are the worst they tell you lies and treat you like crap they pressure you into something you dont want to do and even if you say no 100 times they still wont leave you alone whats the point of giving my money to a company that doesnt care about you its the worst and the thing is they wont to a single thing about it

my new favorite hookah place
i perhaps shamefully had yet to invest in a good headset to roam about the world with and having experienced the crest of a craving for one here in toronto on business i found this shop on yelp quite literally searching for headphones
maybe one of these days ill actually buy something
instead they have gained my business for as long as i am in az because of their direct honesty and good principles
great service and equipment
there were open boxed diapers that personally were over priced
she took down my name and number and said  she would get back to me when they had them in
strelitz once said regarding the biggest challenge he faced with this business finding great people in an industry that neither possesses nor attracts them
very few places i can take my super active four year old to and this place is the besttony does a great job on both him and my hair and we wont go anywhere else
i gave this place a 4 out of 5 because it was a little dingy
it was interesting with torrie and craig both watching as i finished up walking they looked at each other and said brooks pureflow
they also have certain things on sale for the entire month
most of the pottery are 1200 and up
it would be such a shame if this place shuts down i try to encourage it as much as i can for the clothing and shoes
she also brought sales to our attention and helped us save a bunch
there is only one employee at night to handle the entire store and he is not authorized to check anyone out
i guess they figured this out a while ago and decided that since people just come inlook at the merchandiseprice check itgo homelook onlineand then buy it onlinethey might need to make some changeslol
when you call back you dont get a rep but instead a voicemail to leave your phone number ha so they can sign you up for an appointment for their pressure sales
fun to browse but not enough interest to keep my attention for very long
of course the organic  products are expensive compared to their conventional counterparts so i am not giving a low rating based on that

thats the point i decided to leave the store

the only thing getting this the 3 stars is the managers

never go here
i figured it would be a hair supply store i get here and the place has  a lot of clothes on one side some food shoes and a bunch of hair supply stuff on the other side
this record store also has a wealth of vintage clothing books and memorabilia which is just amazing
long story short theyre genuine people who want nothing but the best for you
the sales girls are atrociously aggressive and as yappy and clueless as seagulls
this is just one example if only they could give there cashiers a rockstar and some pop rocks every now and again to get something stirring inside of them my overall experience at target is normally a good one and could be excellent if the cashiers had a little more pep in there step maybe get the slider truck over there to get them some pep peps yeah that will do the trick

and yes comic books are an art form
it really depends on the associate that chooses to help you but i really havent had any issues at this location

three people were sitting around talking doing nothing
friendly knowledgeable staff and an awesome selection of hot sauces

fortunately our contractor was there before they left and had them redo it a third time
the website does not mention the need for a bunky board if the king bed is meant to be set up as a platform for a memory foam mattress hence it was delivered and set up for a box spring
it is dirty and dingy
you want upscale boutiques
a pretty awesome comic shop indeed
so at any time of year does the internet
both miko and jenn are really terrific
just make sure you read the fine print before you start shopping so that you are not disappointed at checkout
i agree with all of the other reviews posted  their customer service is awful and they are not set up to ship things to the us
went there nothing
besonders im geschftskundenbereich spitzenklasse es bleiben keine fragen offen und man wird im tarifwirrwar fair und kompetent beraten
there also is never enough frontend help at the pharmacy so in my experience there is always a line

i recommend purchasing art materials from dick blick which is local in las vegas or online art supplies

they were not pleased but i think they were frustrated from waiting in line and also seeing people behind them so they left without dealing with the girl at checkout

compared to the etobicoke sherway gardens one this location has much more selection of stylish fashionable and young clothing
i recently had az extreme glass  mirror replace our entire glass shower enclosure as the previous contractor screwed up the original install tremendously

i wasnt able to use my groupon before it expired and she was flexible with extending the date which i thought was awesome
thats just unheard of from my experiences
i didnt get the receptionists name tonight but she was wonderful i didnt have to ask her any questions about anything she was very informative in just speaking to me and making me feel welcome in the shop
i dont know but for a 5 star hotel you wouldnt think this will happen
getting them to go this far west of the downtown core however takes a little bit of persuasion
lots of nice shops and even some nice restaurants
es gibt auch kleine accessoires taschen und schmuck fr den schmalen geldbeutel
he even asked me if i could count to 12
great place to get your hair cut
the district at green valley ranch is a super cool and fun place to relax enjoy yourself shop and even get a refreshing drink from the coffee bean and tea leaf

which is rare in any health related field
their ac was busted and it was hotter than hades

a cute place to spend a few minutes sort of sugar factory without the candy theme

recently moved to the area and since eddys is the most convenient for me this is where i chose to go
and if you go pick up a prescription i have waited usually a minimum of 20 minutes
it is pretty large and well spaced out
they have everything you are looking for in every single genre you can think of at new and used prices
it says it all right there
other customers who drove up were also puzzled
the selections are a bit limited but for the most part i can find what i need
when i stopped there today it was severely under staffed and didnt even have any registers openi had to go back to customer service to be checked outlets hope its nit the beginning of a continuous issue overall a good choice but not if you need to check out your options
theres also artisan cheese and amazing seafood and a juice stand and a handcrafted chocolate booth and a bakery and a sandwich shop and oh goodness i can go on
true to its name its unlike any other furniture store
still seeing dr taylor and i couldnt be happier with the service i am getting here
you wont regret it
added bonus they are just over the line in south carolina so i save some money in sales tax
the arrangement turn out wonderful great center piece at a very reasonable price

their process is pretty straightforward a buy counter and sell counter
unfortunately they werent carrying the sizes of both shoes i wanted i liked 2 different styles
affordable professional and very helpful
no one greeted us or asked if we needed help very few employees working and we waited in line for so line to make our purchases that i actually put my stuff back and walked out
we looked around for an available associate and one girl was assisting another couple and it seemed the only available associate mike was too busy texting on his phone
i eventually settled on a bamboocovered mattress from their inhouse brand
finished the last stop of our honeymoon here we really enjoyed
we werent able to find anything to buy but they had a good amount of stock for a last minute visit
they do not have extra charges such as fuel surcharges truck fees and other nonsense fees that most of the other companies charge

dr maloney is awesome
the staff is amazing very friendly and welcoming
completely different experience than last time
it was not my fault in the first place
its not the cheapest glass in the state as it was advertised to be
i need to be reimbursed and instead of remitting a receipt i will have to just submit my credit card statement showing what i paid
she said this was a new place and people were speaking well of it
however everything is marked down
i cant believe how walmart treats its customers
sure you can go online and order husker gear but i highly suggest you take a look here first  the customer service and warm vibe beats any online experience
she knows what i like better than i do
theres also a mr goodfilm so you can get your film fix here all at once
great location lots of stock to choose from convenient to stop on my way home and right now they are giving out 10 off fliers been a few times now and really like this store
so if you are in need of a body treatment see amanda
the man at the shop was very friendly and knowledgeable
you rock duane
figured id grab those too and now i realized we could get another pair at half off so i sent my husband searching for a second pair loudly
portrait innovations wanted to charge me  300 for the disc
and torontogo drink a latte somewhere and leave real artists to deal with the service of other real artists
not only does he have insurance but he is double covered
i loved the combination of flavors on the biscuit pulled pork and egg concoction
the manager nicki was super nice while checking out and very supportive of her staff
the selfcheckout line though why is the receipt so far to reach
it is however the place to go if you are looking for a shoddily painted elvis bust
i saw good prices on hammocks and outdoor furniture lawn chairs gardening items
the contemporary somewhat highend clothing was located pretty close to the front doors so it was next to impossible to shop there without catching a cold draft brought on by the constant openingclosing of the doors
awesomelove to see a familyrun business where there seemed to be so much respect among the 3 as they talked
i wish it was all decked out like some of the newer targets in the area but they are remodeling so i am hopeful
great prices for great products
i ordered the ydd i realized now its short for yabba dabba doo and its delicious and full of sugar
i mean we do expect to get what we paid for
worst book store ive ever been to
i want to give a shout out to vern in the framing department what a jewel of a employee
they also have a very good website but for the best experience you really have to visit the store
have you ever noticed bookstores are the least pressurey stores ever
i took it back not happy
awful experience here
this place was awesome
you should see the audience most were texting talking with their friends and even looking desperate for that silly prefashion game to end
chris is amazing he is very friendly and knows his stuff
i got the modern war gamer package and added the remington 870 and it was awesome
the website is a bit chaotic but the facility itself is clean and wellmanaged
if thats what youre looking for come here the prices are great
he thanked me for being honest and said hed get me fixed up
while my bike got fix i started to look around the shop and an employee didnt catch his name came to talk to me and gave me wonderful lecture of the different type of bikes
long story short kimberly turned an otherwise fantastic experience into a horrible one by openly badmouthing me to another associate one isle over all the while kristi and i just stare at each other bewildered
electronics are tricky to buy so be very careful
top notch staff and great selection of music on both cd and vinyl a must stop if you are a fan of any type of music
great customer service from jonathan at this location answered all questions very thorough and made my shopping experience pleasant
ive been suffering from acne my entire life tried all the treatments out there with different estheticians but laser was the most efficient and inexpensive
so i had to reschedule
so he gave it to me
also told they never go away
the next morning before i got around to calling them i received a call from a gentleman from there and he was quick to inform me of their mistake
its all of great quality practical and generally well priced in my opinion
amazing little shop with so much variety
there is a decent selection of clothing in a wide variety of sizes
its worth a visit  but id say go during the day so you can really see everything  at night its rather dismal bc there are so few lights  youre going to miss some stuff
my wedding was a month ago and i have still not received a call back from mens wearhouse
i feel that there is certain care taken in selecting the most unique and gorgeous cards that stock this store
i looked around for some tshirts and dresses but i didnt find anything that attractive un there
edge this place is a playground for those of us who enjoy eclectic kitchenware and furniture as well as rare treats from around the world
not very warm or particularly friendly
this place has a lot of nerdy guys
ive interacted with him on other transactions and left feeling less than pleased but this was by far the worst experience ive had
sure am glad i found these reviews on yelp
i have been a motorcyclist for about a month now if you count the scooter i have been using but more specifically less then a week with the bike i have
i was recommended to come to revolt tattoos by my cousin who had chad as an artist
they have great gifts for all beliefs
oh my god you are so white
secret menu is hard to know about if you dont research this place beforehand i understand that its a secret but i would like to see what else they offer without having to ask
it makes matters far worst when the past 45 times weve shopped here the food is past due
this isnt my usual smiths but im happy to shop here
at the end of the day the best reason to come here is the staff
plus their discount gas is great
this place is a joke
i contacted the store with the form on their website and they told me to bring it in again and theyd take a look
went fri may 15 2015 730 pm 75100 after an afternoon date we decided to visit the pretty famous vaughan mills mall
this is by far one of the most comfortable stays in las vegas
i walked in with a fellow new client but she was a walkin and without an appointment
she mentioned she tried the pink spot flavor from pink spot
no notice of this or anything or any sign that indicated when they would be open again
located in piper glen shopping center and easily accessible for those of us out for a little exercise on the greenway
so excited i found the dress
also the store look nice and neat and we found some goodies in excellent price
my children loved her right away and with one of my twins that is a monumental feat
i wanted her to wax my eyebrows and she literally pressured me into getting them threaded
i was very pleased and very surprised that they had negative reviews when i came to this site
great prices on organic fruits and vegetables
the girl behind the counter walked my tobaccofiending friend through all the options for natural smokes since shes not officially a smoker cough cough
some    about 25 yrs
if your thinking of going to any ashley furniture store to buy anythingdont
every time a friend comes from out of town we have to do the coach outlet
the manager here is very dishonest and goes out of his way to not help you
best mattress store hands down
still like any apple store once you do get help its efficient and friendly and always what you need
one positive thing i can say about the store is that their selection is huge and there are about two employees that are very friendly knowledgable and helpful
a bit of unbiased background ive been coming to this place for over a year and have since probably have spent over 1000 on miscellaneous and everyone has been typically nice and helpful
theres a cafeteria on the lower level
can you quick
a couple friends and i went to check this place out because it was nearby and needless to say it was one of the best experiences i have ever had
lest u get the wrong impression i do not wear mini skirts tight clothing low necklines or have the least interest in dressing like a 14 or even a 19 year old
im not actually a best buy fan but i had a laptop emergency and needed the geek squad
this is probably more to do with cvs being a poorly run company in general rather than the fault of the employee but seriously dude just have a card to scan for people that dont want a stupid card
since the store has just opened up developing polaroids was half off
julie was apologetic but quite firm in that marling doesnt take responsibility for ordering errors no matter who makes them
and actually im in dire need of a coffee table if youre looking to make up the fact of how your mistake  has enormously inconvenienced me to which his response was  ill see what i can do
i looked around at everything but i dont think its got much for me
heres some more math
left the area clean and even took my old dishwasher
my friend said no
es difcil salir de all sin algo menos mal que no vivo cerca de esta tienda porque sino me dejara todos los dineros
however if you are looking for great deals this might not be the place
i would highly recommend them for anybody else
while i was waiting i read the menu of services and seriously i am done and cant wait to try out more of their services
i refused the ottoman and the movers were not happy about that the look i got was well not nice
he had no clue what i was even referring to nor did he even know the answer
bathrooms maintained as well
i was greeted warmly by the staff right when i walked in
on top of that their storage is tiny so you have to come back later to pick your purchase up
this place is actually one of the cleanest thrift stores i been in and very organized and prices are fair on some items
on the downside i think its a waste to have an entire floor just with kids clothing
they took my computer and had it all fixed for only 235
they take such good care of me
thank you guys for all the help and amazing customer service
another friend had mentioned they had driven through the whole thing in ten minutes which seemed like a big waste for 13car
ive not tried any of the clothes yet which do seem a bit pricey but it turns out a couple of my mates swear by them
thank you to the young woman that helped me and to the gentleman who was also working
in a world where customer service is fossilized jason is a breath of fresh air bringing the meaning back
he looked straight at us and ignored us
roy us very customer service oriented hes a guy running a business to take care of his family give his shop a try support the local guy first
he explained they would take 68 weeks
robert your a life saver
this place doesnt lend itself to anything stellar or amazing in terms of products or food but the atmosphere is enjoyable as i like to grab a sbux on occassion and sit my the little waterfalls of some sort and relax
thanks again michael hanley
i had no idea where i was going so i enterd through the front entrance of ceasars
large selection of clothing almost the entire lower floor and a big selection of rifles and hand guns as well for the shooting enthusiast
i stood at the counter for 15min before i had to ask for help
fun and unique flavors
and if you dont know what something is dont be afraid to ask no one else knows either ha just kidding but seriously just have fun this is a great store
and they were amazing
yup seriously that good
since the place has been opened for only a short time lets give them some time and see whether these small details will be changed and improved
they also have a crazy big toy  bicycle section
the staff is usually pretty friendly and their pharmacy is efficient
the monthly soap club is such a great deal and a fun surprise to arrive in the mail
the merchandise is cool especially the cuff links and the wine accessories
the camera man was so nice that he offered to take a photo with my own personal digital camera yay thumbs up
i literally bought every 1216oz cup they had and they were not cheap
of course thats just the first two shelves
some sainsburys have better baking but not this one
till next time
i was able to purchase some mac lipstick palettes that never made it to the stores in san francisco
the shelves were 12 emptylike it needed to be restocked
im a makeup junkie  this cvs always seems to carry the newest collections
we will be bringing all our alterations to this shop
i live in mesa but i would come here again just for the aveda experience
they have a wide selection of premade food
how cool is that
i will be back for a qalo ring and a new backpack soon
thank you ferre sposa and thank you natasha
i am so pleased that in the future i will go to the dump first for all of my furniture needs
the salesgirl was really nice and patient with me
the lineup of performers are many ive never heard of but thats why i should go and check them out
this is the same orowheatsara lee outlet as the henderson one  i havent been to the henderson outlet yet
they did have a case of fresh flowers but they were all separate stems and priced differently
they were both very professional nice and polite
originally he thought i may need two crowns but after further examination he said he could refill one of the teeth and only have to do one crown
but the real testament to the practice is that ive actually seen two other newer drs here and theyve both also been extremely friendly and helpful
2 my husband had heard good things about a place downtown gabriel shoe repair that had good prices but since we live in the north hills and he had two shoes needing repaired we decided to try northway
for those who dont know in store neimans only accepts its own credit card or amex
ive been here a few times with a friend and have to say that im pretty impressed
i called the number back and a woman answered
overall its still worth buying here more so when comparing to ones better living store which is in the same building
hopefully next year they will be able to do it a little different
i think the dress will be pretty when it comes in and i try it on again and get it tailored to my body
fans should enjoy the quick maybe 15 min walk through
bait and switch for real
i had the most unpleasant experience i have had in my life time
this was after a lengthy search for a clipboard which they never found
theyre the worst shoes
foods that are 3 days to expire will be marked down sometimes more than half off
she quickly understood exactly what my wife and i liked and helped by pulling ideas from several different cards to create the perfect invite
well for this small purchase he replaced the nickelcad battery specially ordered replaced most of the innards tested it on my camera switched out the charger and shipped it back to me
great retro eclectic shop with reasonably priced resale and new items  found very nice steve madden leather like jacket and purse for 18 and 14  great band tees unique and fun jewelry purses and shoes  look forward to going back when were on the east side
actually  the calories burned while walking around make it not as much of a waste
even after a brief stint working here i still love the meatballs
i was referred here by another shoe shop see previous review
if you dont call this guy for your appliance needs then your making a mistake
jessica was great and the color she did on my hair turned out amazing
but the time you have to wait on the phone to talk to a customer service representative is ridiculous
im very happy with both pairs of glasses
no problem they looked it up right there for me and i got my answer
its simply impossible
they even had security walking around like it was art or something and people couldnt be trusted
im a fan of all types of music and even play a little piano but i found myself developing a headache from the repetition of crude drums and lutes from every third world country known to man the wireless headphones allow for spontaneous audio as you approach each exhibit
the arrangement was made quickly and was very beautiful
called the central general question line to ask if they will accept my insurance only to be transferred over to the specific location close to me as the answer is location specific
next time i need something done i think i will try another shop before returning to broken spoke
finally i ended up at wind and the manager was very knowledgeable about the products and suggested i get a wind mobile internet stick
lana is the best
this is the goto grocery store for all my friends and family in the area
i mean the old advanced dungeons  dragons with those hard cover books written by gygax
but i could totallllly see some buried treasure here
very nice shop
some are better than others
as others have said the staffs knowledge is awesome
i went in today and bought a cake white with lemon filling and buttercream icing from the display as it was for a last minute get together
i cannot tell you how pleased i am with my new cabinets
dave and julie owners are helpful friendly and sincerely care about their girls
its hard to find leather shoes that are wellmade these days that arent ridiculously priced so it was a nice surprise to see such shoes at young  tae around the 100 markquite reasonable for a wellmade leather shoe
now im torn
fave febranded items bottled water great price and fine taste pink lemonade creamy cilantro dressing lemon hummus cilantro jalapeno tortillas cuban black bean dip cream puffs tomato and mozz sandwich prepeeled garlic cloves black olives readytouse pizza dough dark chocolate pudding feta crumbles and the seldomseenthesedays ginger limeade
it is always busy and smells like a university library during exam period  gym socks
i dont have the time or energy to figure out how to sharpen them myself and thats what places like the sharp shop are for
walking in the door on the several occasions i have visited i was immediately greeted walking in the door
in other words its not ghetto like some malls ive been to in the san francisco bay area
it was a culinary feat to be able to make such a thin piece of meat so hard and dry
they are establishing the standard that others need to follow
the place is called asian delight and their prices seem reasonable at first glance
recently purchased new furniture when i moved to henderson
there is a pizza hut in this one but i almost never see anyone eating there other than the employees
he set us up with an one on one meeting with kerry the hyde park jeweler
a visit here is a must for all serious cinephiles or for those adventurous enough to expand their horizons
get out before youre temped by the 75 hotdogs or the invasive exotic plants or the hours you could spend in the showroom mentally redecorating and watching the couples turn on each other and their screaming children
first of all the new pricing policy is great
most of the store is binned candy in varying degrees of retroness or frivolity  the sorts of chews and hard candies and gummies that belong to a faroff youth possibly so far off that its somebody elses youth and not yours
what a terrible experience
wont go back
its a good place to hang with a bunch of people
we had a tv crisis the day before the day before christmas
i drive past a handful of vapor shops just to come to this one
after this experience i am defiantly willing to go back and party and last but not least pasties
i was charged 175 each for two plastic bags 350 on a separate visit to put the grains in that i bought and milled myself and i wasnt told this
added bonus they accept online cupons
and perhaps that person will say would you like to see anything while you are here
i even offered to purchase them but was informed that this was not possible since the only item they were able to replace was the screws nothing on the product itself
i go through my watch straps pretty fast as well due to sweat so i go there and they have a huge selection of watch straps and they do the replacement right on the spot
thanks for the pbj
yes they are quite thorough and want to make sure you have the proper accessories and applicable insurances to maintain your products and ensure they last a good deal of time
if i am paying for my wedding gown i do want it spotless not something everyone has tried on
also music volume
crystals incense artifacts clothing and books
this store is larger and staff is friendlier than the store on my side of town
my husband and i have been very pleased with our service and end products from ashleys and we plan to continue to shop there
i had ordered one of the night special duck pierogi with pulled pork pierogi arugulabeets salad and the chicken schnitzel dinner
it seems as though since the renovations  expansion that the quality of service  product availability has gone downhill
i think ive only been to michaels a few times
as far as the service goes its everything you would expect from a 5star hotel
this location will eventually close down looks really dead and the asian guy can be go to the unemployment line
when i brought this up to the front desk the associate tatum told me the only way she would refund me is if i had an allergic reaction
very to the point as soon as he comes into the room doesnt waste your time
ohand really quick forgot to add that the items i purchased were extremely fautly
2 days after my purchase i returned to make an exchange
we found a nice coat bought it and left
not only were they so nice and helpful the bouquet came out ever better than i imagined
i was blown away at the service here
and then when we got ready to pay my friend asked to pay with his square account  you know since there was a sign saying they accepted square payments
also not bad to look at  engaged in great conversation as i was sitting there  he thoroughly explained what was being put in my body and how it will effect me
i didnt end up buying my dress here but there really isnt anything i could complain about
she pretty much spent her entire vegas budget at this store thanks to the more than friendly cashier
you should definitely go check this place out if you are in the area it looks like a ton of fun and i know well be back to actually attend a class and make a creation of our own to take home
with that said if you are a big mms collector or fan then i am sure you will feel different
i miss them
an external sound card and a usb drive dont quite match a robot dog or a set of disco lights in terms of wonder but they do the trick
it is in the strip club area so i would consider this a daytime only place to shop
id recommend letting them help you pick out the type of frames that work for you
in conclusion i would say that this place is good but mostly because of their cheeses
these guys are awesome
i remember when these guys actually cared about their customers back when they were town and country they had a decent parts department and you knew all of the sales guys
thank you for being so wonderful
they have clothing for everyone
lunchbox is currently working on a new location that is less than a mile from the current one but will be much bigger
though my wedding isnt until next summer i decided to peruse the current collection for inspiration
they may be on the smaller side as far as the actual set up on the place but they do offer plenty of things that you are able to order
i dont understand what is the difference from a gift certificate to actual money
she was busy on new years eve day and took me at 1230pm because she had a cancellation
its always messy and the staff is hard to find
variety of a selection too
food  drinks na we just got a beer pitcher theres not too much beers variety
after about three minutes i had my replacement and was out the door
been there several times
she also said the products were 100 money back guarantee but after i bought a few products she asked her manager and he said that wasnt the case
when i arrived the young lady was checking out another client so i wandered around the store checking out the fancy lingerie
all i know is this was one big fat beentheredonethat for me
reillys fall festival has been a tradition in my family for years
a class act and overall great guy he captures your tattoo ideas well and manages to deliver them in a way that not only keeps you satisfied but finds you wanting more of his work
eclectic art that changes every so often
the people working the store were nice which is why this isnt 2 stars but the company needs to really know what books are just basics
inside youll find gambling books gambling equipment las vegas souvenirs a large selection of playing cards and poker chips odds and ends
the 405 isnt a freeway its parking in groups right
this area has a variety of complementary but noncompeting businesses clustered together a braidingblowdry bar and a tanning salon a portrait studio and an art shop a candy store and kids clothing shop and a surprisingly stunning dcor store
other than their furniture the knick knacks and other goods were of quality
i dropped 2 laptops for usb ports and button repair
its there to provide the mother load of everyday necessities to average folks struggling through their average daily lives
first time ever enjoying getting my phone fix
seriously its almost snowing inside
i know it was early in the store and quiet but please dont jump on me the second i walk into the store
i would highly recommend winnie to any bride
so if your power is high be prepared to pay more
their stationary and other books are best purchased elsewhere
so i self parked for free in the structure
the rooms are a little worn but clean
if you havent had it yet  ummm  just get a bottle and be prepared for a surprising variety of flavor
but i want it for half the price you got written here
what more could you want
the staff is easygoing but hardworking and not annoying
macys does not charge shipping if you purchase at least 99 so im surprised that dillards cannot be a little more thankful that business is coming their way
in less than a week my face is almost completely healed
we will definitely be back
the inside however is just your normal runofthemill target outside of an extended starbucksdeli with tons of windows that can accommodate the nearby students
i still decided to wait until a third employee emerged from the back she looked right at me then walked right past me seriously
no toy stores no book stores etc
great customer service
people look very happy working there
ok let me just say that this little place blew me away
they answee y question and mix the paint quickly
finally one of the girls walked up handed us a pile of blue discs and said just put these tags on the dresses you want to try on then went back to her post chatting with her coworkers
i dont even want to give them a one star
we continued to shop figuring we wouldnt be able to get itand went to go find my other 4 kids there gift
they dont do the repairs themselves but the people they have referred me to have saved me hundreds
whatever you are looking for this place has ithm victorias secret metropark bebe bakers fat tuesday guessand also small boutique shops you wouldnt find anywhere else
sure theyre bulky and heavy but if i leave one outside or spill my drink on it its not ruinedand i dont have to recharge it
i bought a set of sheila fleet earrings for a friend who was doing an erasmus year in scotland and she loved them and whenever she wears them she can think of her year in scotland
five stars all the way
i dont have any real complaints other than why isnt sephora here
so basically if you want to sell something there you are screwed if you work like the majority of the world does
i would highly recommend ultas brow bar
in the summer bands play there
when you walk in you can tell that the staff care about how the facility is initially perceived
since the store in beachwood is the only one around here thats where i go
i didnt like the place on the ground floor
but cmu students get in free all year whereas pitt students get in free only during fall  spring semesters
i went to find a manager
none of them acted like they wanted to be there or to help anyone
hes super friendly and attentive
your receipt is selfexplanatory
i had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and i ended up finding out that i am also in love with a brew called 1664 looks like a wine cooler but manages to be respectable instead of laughable
by 530 we were paid up and he was already gone
i have lived in vegas for 3 years now my office is within a 10 min drive of here and i am here t least once a week
we went on 129 at local
feel free to let us know when you reinstate it then well happily give you more of our money
we toured the gardens even though we were dripping of sweat
they were perfect they know this and are surprised when i tell them lines are almost never changed
i should have trusted my instincts and went there first but i was just trying to go with convenience and give the new guy a try
absolutely the best pro shop in las vegas
why pay full price elsewhere when you can pay for them much less here
this store is very rock n roll
i waited a bit to write this to make sure everything would stay nice and pretty and it sure did
i found out today that they charged my credit card twice
she asks me where im from
we tried on every style they had and definitely found out what i did not like
the park does get really busy at weekends especially in summer
i always have a good time every time i come here
i was at the check out paying for my soap honestly just wanting one
i purchased the candy despite my reluctance and skedaddled out of there
dr wyman is fabulous  very patient and very knowledgable
i had an irritation in my eye and saw several specialists before coming here but got an answer and solution right away
the manager was super friendly and assisted us
this is one of my familys favorite malls of all time
well along comes 715 and i get a call its still not ready from a female
my wife and i will be back for some more blowing
holy shit lady chill  just because you see someone carrying four osprey backpacks lol doesnt necessarily mean that theyre carrying over ten items
the girl had to wait for her manager to finish talking before she could even ask me if i wanted my receipt
the lemonade alone is worth the trip
one of the best museums ive ever been to
id love to see forever 21 and other stores in the outlet
i went to the apple store and they noticed just from looking the exterior that something was not right
bought a 1500 dollar couch with the warranty
for item 2 based on our questions we were supplied with 4 additional pictures emailed to me within 20 minutes of my call
i have been to every single location in the state and the pricing is better than most i have been to
which i specifically said i hated
theres also a whole bunch of decorations so you can monster up your house and yard
i feel like you should credit us for these crappy view rooms
totally recommend lana for a great experience while shes drawing on you
the selling point on me completely switching all of my firearm and tactical purchases is the feeling of respect and enthusiasm they had for myself and in the act of doing their job
no one that wants to stay in business runs their business this way
hear ye hear ye
because of that alone i said yes to the dress and picked out a veil
pretty much just one long hallway with a little room at the end
whether or not my daughter ever wears heels gets into these high end things when she is an adult is up to her however this experience for an 11 year old dreaming girl was priceless
if you are hungry they have a wolfgang puck
i am so appreciative that the staff here were kind professional and helpful and they didnt even charge me for their time
im not discriminating or judging against the kid for his lucky youth but i am judging the kid and your company for over charging and incompetentunder qualified repairdiagnosis
so good for frys i guess
got to the officethe front desk staff was amazingly friendly they got me back right away  dr ziff
he seriously stands there and argues with me because hes sooo butthurt that he didnt get a good review and tries to blame the broken nails on the other salon
if i could steal everyones credit cards and shop here for the rest of my life id be one happy chicky
for nightlife the eastside lounge is a great place to chill drink and enjoy live music
they then proceeded to tell me i was being charged a 45 service call fee when their guy had only been there for 2 minutes and hadnt even tested my system or try to ensure that it wasnt something else besides the valve before wanting to charge me
its 1005am and there are a handful of people in there
talking to the direct tv reps are ok but when we received our service the company tried telling us for 4 regular boxes and hook ups were all free but not even two weeks later my family gets a bill for a 1000 soon as i saw this i canceled immediately they then tried telling my family and myself that we must give them 250000 to cancel lol
the thing that pushed me over the edge and made me write this review is that my boyfriend just took his cracked i phone in to get repaired and he is already having the same sort of problems i had after i had my ipad fixed
this store is well stocked with great items at great prices
i shop here once a month
that sums it up
i had to do a super quick yelp search after finding my mom about to lay down 400 dollars for a mediocre twin mattress at another establishment and found mattress direct outlet
i just love it here
i expected hundreds of reviews
my wife and i looked at well over 200 theo frames
you really will save up to 80 and the prices are still negotiableif you know how to barter prices
we even returned to buy a watch
this is our go to place for bulk grocery shopping
honest and quick with services needed
lines are horrible to checkout
they pack a lot of choices and items in that small area
but i will never be aprehensive about this place again
be careful when you shop
bought my first and second piece from here and have been satisfied
i even bought new foam for our dog crate which they cut to the appropriate size
their cashier ashley is absolutely wonderful and helped me a great deal
from the beginning of the process cohl met with my wife and i at 630am before we had to go to work to go over a few ideas and color picks
positiv ist dennoch fr mich die schne auswahl hier und ich selber bin auch ein freund von kaufhusern alles unter einem dach zu finden
we even sat inside one the demo rooms with selected pieces and had the lights dimmed slowly
needless to say
our server was the owner gus
prices are competitive with others and sometimes better
this is a small familyowned business and although ive only been here once the service was friendly and the staff seemed knowledgeable
cool thing about them is that theyll price match same items from amazon or other retailers if you show proof of a cheaper price
small meal before i head on home dont forget to go twice
would definitely visit again when we are in town
burnies is an adventure unto itselfa nice place to spend a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon
even employees admit that they have no idea when the saloon is open
so first i was told that they didnt have any in stock based off all of the reviews no surprise there coming from retail myself they shouldnt be displaying so many items if they dont have it available
great company and a fantastic product
the only problem for me is that i usually end up spending more than i planned to when i come in here
love themelvis from palmdale california
clearly im not alone as this page is littered with similar reviews
he was scheduled from 46pm and he ended up coming around 12 afternoon which earlier is better for me anyways
after a few hours of searching they were able to locate our order
came here with my crew for a bachelor party
they know everything about apple products and i trust them completely

im damn tired of twentysomething kids with attitudes working at places like this looking down at their ipods while youre asking them a question at the register
passion and love of what they do characterizes the staff here and as long as they make it fun for me to buy here ill keep coming back

also i think they need to renovate the look because it just looks old and run down and a giant flea market
a nice thrift shop
she was accommodating and didnt mind the fact i waited until the week off for my final fitting
the stores layout is a tight and cramped so its hard to move around in
i tend to park at dicks sporting goods because most of the stores that i frequent and the food court is near
but because of the hectic hustle and bustle of the store and their raving mad customers that is no excuse to be rude to customers who do not know any better
the staff incredible the products available will blow your mind
i returned to pick up my phone the same representative who helped me before was there yet my 20 was gone
i was experiencing and emergency i begged and pleaded with them to use the restroom
i ended up leaving quickly because i was tired of being followed and was not having an enjoyable shopping experience

avoid this shop like the plague
we thought since the company was not able to deliver according to our verbal contract and that they had not required full payment as stipulated in the small print at the bottom of the receipt that they had already broken the agreement
they said at one time they were going to relocate but i guess not
i would highly recommend visiting this place
i had no idea what to expect but i knew that i do like my teeth and had a date lined up for the evening so was certainly hoping that i wouldnt walk out with a mouthful of janky purple and green teeth from a whitening gone wrong my imagination gets the best of me sometimes
after they called several days later i realized that the receipt i was given said that i owed 17000
you have to check this place out
and because it not just a target but a super target you can do your household shopping and grocery shopping all in one trip
and lastly i find the shop owners snoody
i looked elsewhere since there are plenty of senior equipment stores around town
the lack of a return policy is frustrating also

im not a mall type of person  santan being an open air mall helps me enjoy this mall more than the other malls in town
i ended up buying a new stadium truck as well and i went online in front of them to check their price

good deal with the extra advantage card points but the event wasnt special enough for me so 3 stars for boots is good but could have been way better

companies that dont care about anything but making money and not helping someone under unusual circumstances surely dont care about the consumer and definitely dont care if they do the right thing

as much as the mall is laid out into neighbourhoods none of them caters to any one specific group requiring traversal of the premises to find something specific although i assume someone with an established set of frontal lobes could consult a map of course with the odd exception of a small number of stores notably the bass pro shops location which seems to be as much a tourist attraction as an allinone goto for the serious outdoors types

anyway she said she would email the factory and get back to me the very next day four days later  i still hadnt heard from them so i had to call

seriouslyi found at least 10 or 12 signs in the small area that i shoppedkind of annoying
however i have been in this store three times the past few weeks and every time i am so disappointed with the customer service
i get irritated because they over sell their inventory and you cant depend on them to have the item back on the shelf
such great service

the concept was weird and we werent sure if we should sit or just order an sit
