food is really good
everything was oh so yummy
this was my first time ever trying on dresses
i would definitely stay here again
the staff was great
i was told it would be noted
we ordered a movie one night and the quality was so terrible that it was difficult to watch
the husbandowner is a abusive ss on the phone
i love the choices in barbecue sauce
given our outdoor prairie venue and our number of guests
they make it a point to mention over and over that they spent 5 million to renovate this hotel clearly they spent no time in selecting a team that have any customer service skills or etiquette
that alone earned them 3 stars
while our server jen was excellent the food was comically bad
the sweet spicy chips and dip were great
i got a hummer limo with blaring horrible rap music no red carpet no just married sign
my husband and i were craving something sweet and cream hit the spot
i have been to vegas many times and this is one of the hotels that my parents refuse to stay at
party weekendneed i say more
our room was dingy dirty and old
salad and bread comes with orders
i am a frequent shopper at this 99 cent store
my tan is even and lasts way longer than any other spray tan ive ever gotten
i really enjoyed my staycation  this weekend with my niece visiting from out of town
she also explained everything to us very clear
the room was nice and the bed was comfortable
the casinos arent filled with neon lights
the show started late because of the previous shows delay but it didnt bother us
after check out more than 700 charged to my card
then flew to phoenix area and ive been staying at this fairfield for three nights
this place is way bigger than i expected but great nonetheless
i get a bill on final morning and the last day was still at their special event nascar rate
get the chicken avocado chipotle
im not sure what the difference between piato and piato too are and as a customer this is not clearly defined when you approach the counter
sam has a calm demeanor that helped boost the brides confidence and even myself
it could have been designed better
actually wed ordered a side of sausage not bacon
two things i was very annoyed by
staff and manager is beyond rude and not helpful at all
i died and went to heaven
at least i figured out where the guy coming off the streets to the hotel bar social hour was hiding
i will continue to come back and support this restaurant because i think it is very good i believe they are either from texas because i know when i am traveling and i have been to the ones out there
the lady that helped us was great waived our early check in fee of 1650 because my boyfriend is military she even upgraded our room from skyrise tower to west tower
of course its also a nice place for locals
i cant believe my friends and i stayed here
restaurant orange sky has a great view and nice atmosphere
definitely a must see five stars
i got the short ribs which were ok but nothing special
i expected much better service from such an upscale hotel
ladies you know what its like to feel unattractive and frustrated during pregnancy  as soon as aprili noticed my reaction she jumped in to action she noticed how unhappy i was
its the newer of the two hotels
the room was spacious very clean and newly remodeled
no back a lot more like a bench than a chaise
speaking of the courtyard that tequila lounge thats located just outside to the left has excellent food and as an asset to the hotel
we checked in around 9pm so there was no one
she said she and her mother once ordered the full plate of nachos and there were leftovers
sie kostet 5 eur tag und ist direkt mit dem hotelaufzug erreichbar
for some reason i expected it to feel all kinds of greeeeazy and naaaasty like what i imagine excalibur to be like
we were disappointed that we counted use the spa
well everything is really beautiful even the parking garage
my very first review and i chose sin city partys
it was either feast or famine
omg where do i start with this review
i played blackjack there  when the dealer hit a 3 card 21  busted i commented that she had bailed us out hitting 21 she called the pit boss over who then took everyones bet at the table
this dish wasnt sweet as we expected it to be
this annex store is a bank of enviable goodies they have the kind of items that beckons the question where did you get that
es una tienda en la que curiosear y dejarse los ahorros del mes
very comfortable bed
they were friendly and the service was good
we were only planning to stay till 115130 arriving at 1230 but we ended up staying until 135140 the receptionist informed us about the sunday brunch and the wednesday ayce night as we were paying for the bill
waste of money 1 they do not serve alcohol
we arrive at the hotel and they force you to valet park
come back to the room friday night and bathtub has a foot of water after taking a shower
overall my favorite food items to order are the chicken nachos and any of the tacos
ive been to and hoggedup many photobooths at parties cruises arcades festivals etc so ive had lots of experience to critique photobooth quality and have to say bliss photobooth quality is phenomenal
dont pass by this gem if you are in the a traveler in the train station or on you are on your way to the underground shops
the pool is a magical little oasis surrounded by taller buildings and has a cute little bridge going over it
pesto sauce pretty good seemed like pesto was just mixed with olive oil but was ok the bread was not fresh or warm
the master bedroom was massive with a king size bed
thanks to the owners for doing such a great job
you make all us happy people wait for a table
we lose our airfare and show tickets if we do take what they are cramming down our throats
this in no way affected my enjoyment of the room
the bread they served when we sat down was the best thing i had all night
though it wasnt bad i didnt feel like the customer service was at the top of their game
divey motel you overpay for what you get
everything looks great until you get here
i could not write enough good things about this place
3 guys staying in vegas and visiting the grand canyon not doing late nights having a couple nice meals and going to cirqueit was a decent place to stay but we felt out of place because of how tame we were the place has been recently branded as a pretty racy and young placewe were not aware of this and if i stay in vegas again i would look to stay elsewhere
driving up to it it definitely looked a little bit older but parking in the structure was easy and close to the entrance
i will also add that it wasnt all that busy in here as it easter sunday
wirklich gut ist das frhstck
to order the ribs in the combo is an extra 1
every fast food chain has their king on top
however if you are concerned about privacy there is a curtain that will cover up the entire bathroom area
i had a good time bowling but the employees here ensured me that i would never come back here
it has a friendly family style atmosphere
anyway my son is always in awe of the shoot outs in the middle of the town
the urinals are like the rolling stone lips not sure if the womens room has anything cool
the staff at the front desk is usually helpful even when i have to question my charges which i do a lot here
it has so much character and thought put into the layout you cant help but feel relaxed
what was a little inconvenient was the housekeeping staff kept knocking and trying to open our door about three times while we were trying to catch up on some much needed sleep
room was clean and modern looking
so i put it up to my laptop was broken and needed repair as the toshiba consultant told me
this isnt a bad thing at all because of the main reason to go to this best western
we also ordered the mac and cheese which is one of the best options on the menu
the view was incredible
after i wrote this review the manager came by and asked if i wanted more cheese melted on them gotta love that
the view of fremont st from the lounges windows is an iconic vegas image and now the space has been augmented with the addition of a handful of televisions
accidents happen they cant be perfect every time right
for the price its a good value dont get me wrong but every time i play here they stack so many groups on top of each other that the round is five hours plus or you dont finish
the gm had no problem at all with the situation and at one point even said if you can get cash off the card we rudy cut off the gm and said we dont take cash deposits
anyways j went to take a nap and pulled sheets down to see hair all over the place gross
the salad came with whats basically a bag of dried vegetables on top
the first time i went to spirit was to check out my friends band shaky shrines on their opening night
place dirty mangey right just that feeling of ick
rgerlich war in beiden studioline studios dass auf den gutschein nicht wirklich eingegangen wird und einem sofort nach dem shooting das teuereste abnahmepaket von fast 300  aufgedrngt wird
his machines are top quality
its pretty bad wifi for a good hotel
the closest place to sit down for a quick lunch near the hilton garden inn on a rainy day and i would have rather sat out in the rain
tip  if you arrive at night get familiar with the layout and light switches
we also went to rehab and had a blast
my kids love mat franco from agt so we bite the bullet and spent a lot of money for the tix to see him
they were not busy at all
the room was really clean and i liked the fact that the window blindscurtains opened automatically the first time you check in and open the door
its time that prices were reasonable for those items
this is the third year i have stayed there and have never had a problem till this yearwe checked out and with in  three hours i call back to let the hotel know that i had left a brandnew pair para pants and a brandnew giants tshirt and i was told that the room was checked and nothing was found
not in any way a dealbreaker  just odd
i didnt learn anything
update to previous post wherein i almost died of smoke inhalation  soalthough the hotel was completely sold out the staff manager kindly moved me to a completely smoke free suite a couple of doors down
they refilled our glasses only once after we had asked for the check
something new and different for the cranberry area
i love the patio space with ample hangout room close proximity to the bar area and easy view of your food cooking on the open grill or in the airstream trailer kitchen
the potatoes were fresh cut and topped generously with the truffle oil
we loved so many things about this hotel but there were some mitigating factorsmain problem was terribly loud ac in our room that woke us up all night whenever it came onsecond didnt dig the loud people in courtyardwe waited until 11 pm before we became unhappy about that due to early flight outwhat we loved though was nice staff gorgeous pool area with cool retro vibe comfortable bed type cabana furniturewe loved phil the property peacock and we really loved riding the bikes around scottsdalethe location is terrific and its a nice change from box hotels on highways which ive sworn never to spend my money on again
yes the furniture was a lil damage but i didnt use it
but the hot eggs were hard and flavorless
it is easily within walking distance of everything you would want to see including the royal mile and the edinburgh castle
i even asked for special flowers and they were more than able to meet and exceed my expectations
i was nervous about staying here after reading some if the negative reviews but we didnt have any problems
the thing i really wanted was a tub not a shower so i could take an epsom salt bath to help my back after too much partying
i highly recommend
it was the only delicious drink we got out of 4 i really hope they either revamp the drink menu or at least add to it for some less entrylevel concoctions
always too hardcore
i also told them i would pay for an upgrade and they told me i could not and that i would have to call groupon
the room was plenty big and we loved the huge bathroom and double sinks fridge etc
skanky mensroom but i can forgive that for good service  lucky tables
also the menu is on a moving screen and it can get annoying when your trying to look at it and it changes to a movie preview
i was very very pleased with the room
the halls and rooms are severely dated      and not really what i would expect from a sheraton
a new favorite of mine
the lines stretched practically out the front door
and occasionally the servers are terrific
my favourite dish from brunch was the cup of the lobster bisque which came with toasted slices of bread
do not come to this hotel
no mold in shower
parking is pretty easy
the buffet was very pricey 50 for two during brunch and the food was meh
within one block we had great lakes nano brewing and market garden brewery
great place to relax with a bourbon or nice glass of wine
the staff is always courteous and the condition of the course is always top notch
when i crawled into bed i could not believe how comfortable the bed was and the pillows were just as comfortable
im looking at you the guy that stamps our hands at the entrance
will have to try other options one day but for now i love their salad
from pizza to sandwiches to fried foods it has all the typical bar specialties but def could use some spicing up to draw more of a dinner crowd
everything was super fresh modern and at your access
theyve recently raised their rates which is understandable and luckily we are repeat monthly customers for almost 2 years now so were offered a discount
no matter which powder you use squeeze it its the best way you can tell the difference
everything also seemed pretty clean and they have a nice pool and gym
also there are great attractions at the mandalay bay  which you can access
i had to move further away because my eyes and face felt really warm for the large bursts of flames
easy solution for anyone thinking about coming here just do it
having worked in a hotel for many years i am very selective that i get a 5 star place while not paying a 5 star price
good food for a good price
always helpful and friendly we could not have asked for a better place to get married
ive stayed in this resort three times for work
this is just another way to add on to the extra profit charges
ill probably try to stay elsewhere next time
if youve ever been to a kids place you know this is key
the service was friendly and helpful
excellent  service good italian food a nice wine list and a warm atmosphere make this a great spot to visit whether youre a local or visiting out of towner
ive been to vegas 15 times and my favorite hotel based on the room itself up until now was the venetian
this tends to be a great goto spot for lunch meetings and really any business lunches
we even shared the mushroom cappucino it was a great conversation booster and provided a lot of laughs
she was quick and responsive her style is unique yet classic and her professionalism was impressive
i know theres not much in fitchburg but for the money i would have rather stayed down the street like in downtown madison and had a significantly better experience
alle hauptspeisen wurden in derselben braunen maggiesauce ertrnkt  fr einen preis pro gericht von eur15  eur25 ein witz
upon check in we were told it was not renovated at they would charge us 100 more to upgrade
which we heard every night all night for all 4 days of our stay
my husband ordered the meat and cheese plate it was fine just average
the yelp menu had the pastrami sandwich that sounded so good but when we arrived it was not on the menu
the gift shop is just unreasonably expensive
durants in the area up scale rat pack style steak house bootleggers old town scottsdale
please do not park in front of our houses please do not drop your trash on our streets please do not pee  or throw up on our rose bushes please do not break into our cars please try and avoid our children on their bicycles please stop for the school bus  red cones mean dont park at alland when asked to move your car please do not threaten the neighbors
got to planet hollywood expecting the same
her baked goods are very unique and the alcohol flavor is light and not overpowering
you just have to suffer through the construction
nothing stays the same and i love change but not when it involves my valley institutions
three of them walked past me without acknowledging my presence
corky and lennys is one of a kind
i want to write a followup review to give stars to the management team
i was pleasantly surprised when i saw the bill
the best thing was people watched me get married all over the world  they have camera everywhere to catch all the magic
service was great  and when they all realized that i tip well service became even better
rooms are tiny with too much furniture crammed inside  ended up putting the footstool for the chair on the windowsill
farther up the strip no casinos more bang for the buck
it clearly does not pay to shop around
for the bridal shower i attended we were in a suite and it was pretty lovely
hard to overlook
delito get your cold sandwiches grillhot sandwiches and hot entrees salad bar nacho barstirfry bardepending on the day
we rarely saw him and even the matre d helped us out  she was great
i didnt mean to
you can walk to all the key attractions from the hotel
my son and i wont come back
since this venue is in the boondocks we opted for nonalcoholic bevs
i came here on coworker recommendation
it was a horrific night and none of us got a decent nights sleep
i told her no because no one called me back
yes this place is a drive but so beautiful and worth it
afterward her gear was struck from the stage and the crew did their obligatory sound checks for the headliner
no hangers   i didnt bring anything fancy
the place is really dirty and if you want arcade games go to chuck e cheese where they dont rip you off charging two tokens for most games
one of the seven pools is a sand beach
she brings us menus
i prefer carmines salad and say its worth the 3 difference
another year another frozen fury and another disappointing experience with poor sight lines inability to see the scoreboard from several angles and drunken fans acting like fools
admittedly its decor is a direct result of todays plush bar style that seems to be everywhere but nonetheless the level of polish applied to everything certainly works for me
2 reps so we missed our 0430 shuttle to the airport
i was lucky enough to have been able to stay at the wynn on my previous trip and like one of the other comments mentioned i expected that the palazzo would rival the wynn or belagio
i like their decor inside a lot more actually intense painting by the inner round table and just the mature vibe at the bar
there was fruit pancakes hashbrowns and some type of cheese biscuits
clean excellent sports bar great dinner including price indoor pool and jacuzzi and real eggs for breakfast
gordon ramsey burger was very good
a colleague invited me to lunch one day and i finally got to try it
a cooler version of the brady bunch decides to buy a hotel in scottsdale
the main room had the master bedroom balcony master bath kitchen and living room with a sofa bed
the only thing that had scared me a little were the elevators
this place is a dreadful example of taking a chance on a place without yelp reviews
i ordered the strawberry mint salad
i offered to tip the ladies for their amazing work but they wont accept monetary gifts
there were also lots of folks walking through the lazy river holding their cans and bottles just above the water
they have a nice wine desk in the evening and we had a container of popcorn and couple sodas waiting for us when we got to our room
they are however electric so theres no exhaust smell and they are faster than gas ones ive driven as well
xoxo dont get a waiter to save our life
however the experience is ruined by the apathetic and then downright condescending attitude of their check out staff
the young bartender was very personable and efficient
if you enjoy shopping aria connects to crystals shopping which is a great collection of high end shops such as bulgari dior fendi prada and gucci
completely phonedin performance
from the minute we got to this hotel it has been the worst experience ive ever had in vegas or any other hotel for that matter
the greens werent my cup of tea
buyer beware for sure
we get back to the room after being gone all day and no clean towels or beds made
i saw death cab for cutie there on st patricks day and it was great
the room came with two beds couch dining table and desk but most importantly in the kitchen we had two complimentary bottles of water
i highly recommend it as an alternative to staying at the mgm grand
this motel 6 isnt in the greatest part of town but the casino next door had the best chili con queso in the world
frisches geschnittenes obst war mangelware
perfect place for brunch at venetian if you did well the previous night
ambience looks like an italian cheesecake factory
they give me oops faces without any sorry feeling
there are a bunch of different cookies available chocolate chip mm oatmeal raisin sugar and ice cream to boot cotton candy pistachio which is a really hard flavor to find in las vegas for some reason birthday cake strawberry cheesecake and the flavor i chose circus animal cracker
hier mache ich es kurz ein nettes businesshotel mit super sbahn anbindung die haltestelle ist direkt am hotel man braucht ca
they continue this tradition today only now they will pose for selfies
you owe yourself a trip to the boat
before we found vegas weddings we were a little nervous that our wedding would be cheesy especially when we decided to do the drivethru
i cant wait to give her a big hug
we had a luxury suite with the 3 flat screen tvs like other people mentioned great furnishings and the curtains and roman shade was even remote control operated
said i had to go through hotelscom which was a lie as hotelscom reached them and the flamingo hotel told hotelscom that they would not return my charges
im a big believer of customer loyalty if a place treats its guests right and ive only gotten the best treatment here at aria
i wonder why its not located right by the street and yet youd have to enter a deadend long winding curved street to get to the fairly big parking lot and also whats with the exotic name of the building the buildings name was originally at the former location of 15th avenue and washington street in 1921 and relocated to this location in 1989  the former building was renamed polly rosenbaum thats standing today
just wanted to do what we came to do wonder at the fascinating world of birds
there were a couple ladies manning the registers didnt see any other employees
they need certified playground monitors to make sure kids are being safe and no kids are being smothered in some pile up
i wasnt aware that earl of sandwich was a chain and im a little disappointed that googling best sandwich in vegas led me to a glorified jimmy johns
really dated and showing its age
book your room here when in scottsdale
for whatever reason reviews for this place are all over the map
we checked it out last week and man oh man were so happy we found another tiki bar
they do this every time regardless of what your reservation says
some timeshare i believe
perfect location on the strip as well
i am here now and it is miserable
i had to waive my hand near the unit in order for it to turn on
free breakfast too
i did mention to her that i wanted to be moved to another property and she told me that i neednt worry about valet or security
2 the drinks are cheap
check in line was long but express check out was very easy
the room was big and clean
nearing 13 bucks for beef these things should come with a side but they dont and i was thrilled that we split sweet potato chips to start or i would have been starving after
price got a great deal here for about 180 for 2 nights on vegascom plus 2 free buffets
the floors were lit with cheap blue rope lights like the kind you buy at home depot or spencers gifts
case in point the robe in the closet looks like it came from goodwill
alsothe freemont experience is right outside the door
i rated it three stars because i was basically forced to stay here in order to purchase garth brooks tickets which is probably by design of which i have no problem
they are providing sustainable jobs and skills to adults with autism
i got the burger and it was very good
thank you hampton inn medina for a very pleasant stay
this was nice for getting around
i was craving for some good island food today and i wanted to try thisomg its freaking awesome
it was a really good deal  138 for 1 night stay in a deluxe room on a friday night
aloha to you too
i cant say enough about how poorly this hotel was and i again suggest that no one ever book a room here
i would feel terrible if someone else hurt themselves
stuart photographed my two boys at the park
it was so much fun
an come to find out all 6 of our rooms were on different floors
dont think that this is going to be a resort style experience
for me it was ok i dont like it when the room is in another building
also breakfast is a steal at 599
these are all standard things in a cheap marriott or hilton and it was disappointing that they were not included with the room
i stayed at this hyatt and was soooooooooooo impressed with the hotel
mccarran terminal 3 also has a las lounge for 35entry havent been there so cant say how it compares
service was excellent our waitress was very efficient
of course i love this spot for a drink after work and i always find it a struggle to locate places in yorkville with televisions to watch a game however im hoping i just caught coco on an off night
they didnt wipe any down
so my current reality
the venue was packed creating my spot to be the prime real estate with elbow room
most highclass place ive ever stayed
the water pressure for the shower was kinda weak
the indian girl stays inside the tree
and vice versa except not so pleasant for the person showering
we felt like we were his guest all evening
i wouldnt recommend this place for small kids or if youre looking for value and quality
after some back and forth with travelocity and having them unable to guarantee wed receive the correct number of beds i called the hotel directly and they were able to get us a much better rate
i didnt stay in the hotel but the lobby area and casino are nice and of course the view of the eiffel tower is great
once youre inside it doesnt even feel like you are in las vegas anymore
this place was gorgeous and she was impressed
we should have just taken the cake in and had them taste it
we set the record for the fastest a room was solved with the first one which was a little disappointing that it ended so quickly but the staff was understanding and gave us a discount on doing a second one that gave us a bit more of a challenge
checkin was quick and easy and the front desk attendant mj was very friendly and inviting
price is decent
i would reccomend the wax over the deuce otherwise you will be stopping way too much and take forever to get to the strip
not a fan so i got a 20 oz
great place cool atmosphere we had the salmon dish and the king crab legs and they are both out of this world
overall nice trip if you want a peaceful getaway
you can get the same thing at filebertos for a lot less
okay july is peak season and i guess february isnt so some type of increase is okay but they just put themselves at a price point where id rather visit a different resort just for the experience
they tried to seat me in a lowly corner rather than main area
the images were beautiful
we chose the option of breakfast in bed each morning because we like to take our time relax a little and not be rushed to meet a breakfast deadline
i would have loved a facial but at over 200 with tip it was a little steep for even me  someone who has no problem pampering myself but my face is rather small to spend 200 on a simple facial
this is a great place to crash and to gamble
their water fountain show is fun and romantic and is done every hour
bad  old  not very clean  resort fee is 22night in short  hotel c  casino c  pools a the safe in our room didnt work
we approached two parked cabs which were oddly unoccupied
at that point i said fine
all the marble topped tables are chipped  many with 4 broken corners the bar stools are mismatchedand placed inattentively the hallway to the washrooms is filthy and in an  embarrassing state of dusrepair theres peeling paint in the dining room
finding someone who spoke our language as a primary was impossible and some issues arose from that but also ignorable
now the reason for 3 stars slow slow slow
they only give you two crappy pillows for a king bed
i never have a problem ever except this time
theyre a good size too just a bit smaller than a brick
it was tender like a filet but juicy like a rib eye
now clarendon if you want repeat customers dont gouge the customer on the pretext of aliens
when i asked for my money back i was told that thats also a no can do
everything was clean and it included one if the most amazing bathroom layouts that ive seen
it was a super vibe vivacious vibe
since my friends had been before there was no question as to where we were staying and we were upgraded to vip status
i got in when i told them u would arrive late af they said no worries
i was annoyed but i didnt mind giving chipotle next door my money instead
love the colors and the white brick walls with orange curtains and the translucent glass between the beds and the bathroom area
ive not been here for a meal other than brunch but i will absolutely do so and let you know
gym had free weights up to 50 lbs and 3 new treadmills
they were suggested by the venue
i decided to come here and even though its not my first time its probably the best bbq ive had in a while
we then discovered that the tv was not connected to the cable system
in fact many parties would probably otherwise not want to hit the strip club at all and that is probably why its the first club destination on the itinerary
the location was also wonderful just a 1520 minute walk to chinatown or old port
in return all our bridesmaids mothers and grandmothers came to veras to purchase their gowns
but the safe in my new room didnt work either
all the reviews i read indicated this place was hopping but now i can say it myself the hard rock is partay central in vegas
so customer service was excellent when i had a problem
kaffee gab es nur aus der kanne
loved the atmosphere and especially the view
front desk staff was very friendly and helpful
i was confused  why is that
make a point to visit mix lounge very much worth it
then you have to go through slots and the table games and then hit the lobby around 510 minutes later depending on your walking speed
now is when i admit the ugly truth i am not a pizza snob
i needed a pet friendly room and ended up booking a larger room then those typically designated as vdog rooms
i have to say never expected the experience this new staff provided
when im taking a shower i need to see everything shaving is incredibly hard if you cant see well
not even alarm clocks
to compare vinnie zucchini to frankie tomatos is waaay offi have been to frankies many times and although it is nothing more than a canadian take on italian it has killer calamarii went once to vinnie zucchini and i will never go back
bring the kids and stroller too
my friend works here and recommended we spend the evening there with a group of friends
in october 2010 there were 5 weddings scheduled for our day in sept 2011which was considered low
we ordered bbq wings to start
he was 30 mins early from the time i wanted him there and he stayed 30 mins after our agreement time
in mn when we say custard were most likely talking about the creamier fattier version of ice cream not the more classic version thats the consistency of a thick pudding
i love that they are all inclusive options
we provided them but the name he wrote down was different than the childs name
the club is probably not a top club in vegas but the view from the rooftop deck is great and the djs were great the few times i went
lets start off with the basic room
during one of our last days someone was knocking on a door so loudly upstairs that we thought someone was knocking on our door
theres a casino arcade bowling different restaurants to choose from coffee shop ice cream shop and a movie theater
this review is for the lunch buffet
overall this is a great little bakery
the location is considered in the middle of the las vegas strip
they have a huge selection of costumes and party favors
try it and enjoy it
everything ive tried here is legit but the full montague is by far the best
i would stay here again for sure if only for the unbelievable level of service you receive as a guest
tons of great restaurants and pubs
bad small stuff  stain on our bed cover queen size bed in a king size bed enclosure some parts of the property look unconverted to westin standards from whatever the hotel was before
like others have noted there are just endless options for eating here
39 eur fr ein doppelzimmer incl
we recently took a trip back to vegas and decided to give the venetian another try
its so close to the strip its like staying on the strip
the food was good but i wasnt in love with it or anything
when we arrived we were greeted by the parking attendant who offered their assistance with true interest and not the  i want a tip attitude
there are more parking spaces on the 3rd and 4th floors
ideal auch die nhe zum flughafen
i was in town for a conference so i didnt have to pay my way
we finished the scones and the waitress gave us additional scones without us asking
save your money stay somewhere else
in the end they could not resolve it
i cant speak on any other towers that they have
plus they seem to be a little homophobic and they dont open on sundays because of some stupid reason
this hotel has really gone down hill since my last visit
the waiters were all formally dressed
but enough to fill 12 of the shuttle
i recommend you check it and if you are unable to complete a project at home you can take it there and theyll encourage you to find your inspiration
ive seen many places triple and quadruple the retail price of a wine
we stayed for a long while because we were charmed at every turn
the food was really good and they had good beer available in big frosty mugs
the pool outside looked great although it was a bit below swimming temperature for me at the time but again  it looked great with the outdoor bars and everything
talking stick sits in the middle of a flat plain of nothing
great show that exhibits incredible skill
this hotel is what you call a place with good resources but poorly managed
i know this is a petty issue but its just the point
so we mentioned it on the way out
tay was fine i thought the 170 a night for such a cheap outdated room was a bit much but we were across the street from the concert venue we were going to so that was a plus
due to the crowds it could be a little noisy for trivia playing particularly when the sound system for the trivia announcer went out but theres not much you can do about that in a bowling alleybar
taxis and shuttles just like any other hotel were a little tough to get a hold of but another tip spend an extra couple bucks and get one of those suvshuttles that arent taxis but charge a flat rate rather than a timed rate
now i dine out a lot but just couldnt understand half of what was offered
the luxor is an older hotel so its a little worn
featuring amazing varietals  from around the world including the companys own awardwinning wines this evening of live music and wine tasting proclaimmed its residency upstairs at the house of blues exclusive foundation room
cleanliness is not of importance for this hotel
this courtyard by marriott is probably a step below other courtyard by marriott hotels out there
it was chill but still lively and had decent music surprised us as we are both snobs and my bf is a dj haha
i was a lil confused by the tots at first because they are shaped like mozzarella sticks i was considered they wouldnt have cooked well that way
the music is always goid
true i dunno
coordinator lady is really rude as well and doesnt care about the clients experience at all
whats up with these reviews this place is easy to get to and next to everything food shopping and a movie theater
there is no more solicitors in the main lobby and the casino lo longer reeks of cigarettes
not a bad idea considering its summer in phoenix
is it obvious im not a smoker
the gym while its available is really small for a resort and there are no classes such as yoga spinning that are present at some of the other fancy places
had we known that he wasnt going to be there we would have had all conversations with the event coordinator who ran the event
there wasnt anything wrong with the place
bobbette and belle have by far the best cupcakes in toronto
i drove from 30 min
try any of their burgers 3 during happy hour and you will be happy
when i asked themthey said  yesdont worry but i was pissed off why they didnt tell me and there was a huuuge noise
die preis leistung stimmt einfach nicht und es erinnert eher an ein trkisches grossraumhotel aus den anfngen der 90iger
their asian restaurant is really good
i love love the way the bellagio looks and one of my favorite dinning experiences in vegas took place at the bellagio
there is a beachside indoor ac casino
and i have been burned a few times when going out of my way it is a little off the beaten path for many to score some delicious home fries only to find that the qs had inexplicably closed early
and cannot wait to try them out
i was pleasantly surprised to find that nyny was not
i was so jetlagged i couldnt remember which tower i wanted the forum tower so i simply told the person to give us the best one thinking that thats what we would get
ive worked with david on and off for a couple of years
we got a great deal to stay here so i was really happy to see what we got for how little we paid
the room was hugeking bed with a sitting chair sofa and coffee table and three windows
we stayed here last weekend
and a salad which was apparently  full of  market vegetables
unfortunately even moderate expectations were dashed at this property
or let the water run for 10 mins
the restaurant is fairly new small and midtown
they werent so concerned about watching the clock and the kids got some extra jump time
4 hours of crazy outdoor fun
we settled on the evening special  braised beef cheeks ie
the fried chicken was some of the best ive ever had
i actually stayed and hung out for over 2 hours not something i normally do but then again i was winning sooo but in all seriousness i think they did a great job with the remodel but its clearly targeting the younger crowd so if you dont like loud music this place is not for you
we stayed at the place and it was terrible and the room was half way cleaned checking in
my most recent visit to the park toronto had amenities from le labo which is a boutique cosmetic company heralding from paris and only sold in one store in toronto
he then took my drink order
they have lots of locals perks the carnival world buffet is a great go and a deal for locals as are some of the shows
its also nice to see the array of fresh herbs that are used and chefs cooking in action
they accomodated every request with a smile and i will definately be back again
from the moment of checkin throughout  our entire stay the services they provided had me very impressedas i should be right
i really fell in love with this place and i think youll enjoy it as well
prices are reasonable
is it overpriced
the deli sandwiches were as good as any i have had in philly  chicago or kansas city
food 4 decor 5 ambiance 5 service 4 value 5 the food was slightly short of great but the star here is clearly the beer
i had to order boiled pasta with only butter on it cuz the kids would not eat the things they had on the menu and it came out to be 21
they offer a solid collection of funny poetic and uniquelydesigned cards that you definitely wont find anywhere else
we arrived a little early for our reservation so we past the time in the bar
i called today 82 to redeem my credit and i was told that there was a 15 minimum i decided to ask the girls in the office if anyone wanted to order and they did so i called back and spoke to stephanie to place the ordershe now stated that i had a 50 cent credit yessss a 50 cent credit towards my order
spa part of my allinclusive package was a day pass to the spa
bellas traveling tea party just did the refreshments for a ladies and girls tea at our church
she said nope you need to get it from her
this is one of the few bowling alleys that is both clean on the outside and on the inside
the tour is pricy we did the float land and helicopter tour to grand canyon and hoover dam which was close to 1000 for 2 of us
highlights and things of note  bread is really good bread is warm price was under 10 sandwich is on the small side located in planet hollywood near east entrance order and pick up
i enjoy dealers that at least put on some makeup and try to make themselves look nice
youre sure to see a celebrity or two
and even the mirage while much older than the encore is more lively and fun
took two little girls 6  7 and they had a blast
basically this attraction has three partsorigin experience which has tons of cool interactive activities films and a little zoo of desert life desert lving center which is all about conservation and gardenstrails which is a bunch of interconnected trails
pool can be fun if youre with a big group
i love your spaciousness and your great selection of slots
2 tube televisions
another guest also asked for it and faced the same response
since i am no a golfer and was here for my uncles birthday weekend we ordered brunch
then as an adult i thought i would give it another shot
we were sort of hesitant to do it since its was a spur of the moment kind of thing but ended up doing it anyway
i asked for the rigatoni to be cooked al dente but it was overcooked and bland
the meats that came around were not that flavorful the steak was tough
was in town for a conference and had a wonderful stay
rude people wont be back and wont refer this hotel to anyone
our kid will be ready for the pool in no time
had my wits been more about me i would have turned on the inbathroom flat screen tv to help pass the time
id love to stay here again
really this is the only reason i didnt give the 5th star for perfection
we spent all of our days there hanging out at it reading and listening to the music they played
thank you savour mississauga and yelp for helping me discover newhidden restaurants in my neighbourhood
i had a few of my friends come with me to check in to my room at the hotel
the dog was aggressive each time
there was broken furniture a dirty stove old sheets and no tv remote
i plan to visit their new location for more colourful inks when they open
but what makes the matter worse is if you dont get a change to take advantage of these resort amenties they cant waive this fee
the young girl just gave me a glare as i approached the truck
no im not a pervert but i think men should unite  stop being weird about nudity
then rent bay  think lane if you were bowling by the hour
huge play structure for kids of all ages to run jump climb and slide
the quaint french atmosphere surrounding the casino themed shop fronts etc
so much fun and the food was fantastic
the suites are like a 1 bd
he said its because bank of america owns many of the buildings downtown and they are super conscientious about security
this is not one of them
another thing the walls r really thin here
this is overall a really impressive aquarium
we had to close all the curtains during daylight hours to get a good clear viewable picture
heard about this place from a friend after it was on food network
we did order room service for dinner once and it was quick and very good
if you call down to guest services from the phone in your roomplan on being on hold approximately 20 minutes
it was nice warm and flaky
my money stretches further with their program
i loved my airbrush tattoo it was beautiful
however next time we might pay a bit more to be more central on the strip so we dont have to pay all of the cab fares
so we had to improvise as you can see in the photo and the kids were not too thrilled
however i guess thats what i get for choosing to eat in our hotel out of convenience
you really need to look for the place but when you find it its a gem
while waiting for my order to come up i browsed the grocery and wine section a bit and saw some very unique productsbrands that i hadnt seen before
they have some great fish dishes as well as standard bar food
drinks are pricey and this place isnt roomy so there is no standing and recovery areas
uh ok i can deal with that i guess
hell yeah see yall
plus it is more expensive than frankie wont go back again
i guess the best comment was from our 16 year veteran cabbie who remarked when we left the cosmopolitan to go back to the palms place
so why not sign up and see what this place is all about
she placed me on hold for some ten minutes returned and told me the front desk reiterated what shed stated to me
their prices are kind of pricey  but you get a lot out of what you pay for
prices are reasonable and you will be treated like the queen that you are
the valet had us checked in less than 3 minutes later we unload her luggage and head inside
the rooms are cheap which leaves more  for amazing food and shows
stayed at the sls tonight
when i checked in i was given room 5155 on the 5th floor only to have a broken leaky ac unit
the bartenders are just so rude
i want to live there
easy  the beds
thats what im going to focus on you can find the big picture stuff elsewhere
the mushrooms were underseasoned and the truffle oil made it taste a little off
simply the best casino on the strip imho although it has taken way too much cash of mine but im its bitch it keeps treating me bad and i keep begging for more
we have absolutely zero complaints
its a great value and really is a way to do vegas differently
if nothing else this was worth the trip
id pass on the melodrama
they put a grip of alcohol in first then add in the slush of choice followed by added shots if you want
knows the menu inside and out and can articulate with passion the options
the speakers are all in surround sound
cant wait to go and bring more friends back there
i did come with a party of about 20 people so i can understand why this might of happened
great for relaxing but nothing else going on
from the moment you park your car and step  out there is magic in the air
included all the amenities of a hotel and was top notch accommodations
i appreciate the staff and the hospitality but you may want to burn the mattress in room 248
we made reservations and it was very unorganized when we arrived people who came after us and who didnt have reservations were seated they finally remembered and they seated usthe owner  i think was giving everyone wine while we were wating which was nice
tonight is night five of a stay and i figured i would close it out by seeing purple reign tonight
beautiful room with a king bed and a separate sitting room with a jacuzzi tub
this was my first time here
is this bugsy siegels vision
besides a giftstore a  sunglasses shop and a douchelord shop  ie selling a lot of affliction ed hardy and true religion there was no other retail shops
the service is definitely not en par with other restaurants of this caliber
i really liked the aloft charlotte uptown
the complimentary buffet was mediocre
highly recommend tracking this food truck down and trying it
overall its a very nice hotelbut for more than 300 a night in a nicebutnotchicago midwestern city i expect a very nice hotel with a nice terrace and a great view
she got her wish
love the parking and location
i want to buy this by the bottle
my husband stated that this is what they will serve when you go to heaven
those items were better but still nothing memorable
i beg to differ dude
the pool water was so cloudy you couldnt see the bottom of the shallow end not to mention my flip flops stuck to the pool deck with ever step because it was so grimy and gross
and then from my 21st birthday
we had 3 different rooms until one was barely ok everything from the floor to the bathroom to the beds were absolutely disgusting
i heard someone mention a place on 15th st and mcdowell and figured it couldnt hurt to check it out
after a good breakfast i decided i wanted the big tall frozen margarita with the plastic cup that you can take home
in a burning car
the staff was nice
upon flushing the dirty water completely exploded and splashed into my legs and my right arm since i was using it to flush the toilet
instead of walking us to our table the manager my assumption as he was later dictating orders pointed to a table and we made our way over
nothing of much value there
we wont order it
rooms were clean with decent amenities
despite being an older lesswell known property the experience was okay
it was all free the room was absolutely stunning but i didnt pay for it and the downstairs looked like a senior citizens convention was in town
they will lose my companies business
since our wedding was in vegas it was a destination wedding and super stressful to plan details but ann eased my stress and gave me a great experience
cons stinky housekeeping did not try to air out the strong body odor smell from whoever last stayed in the room
the power balance and handling are all tuned in like a fine italian car should be
after not hearing very good things about this hotel with regards to the antiquated rooms and loud noise level i set my expectations pretty low
this place is very very nice a mix of renaissance decor with architecture that seems to encompass anything and everything
no refills of shampoo soap or lotion
she tried to give directions via a paper map to self parking and then walking through outdoor hallways to my building but of course i got lost and just winged itfinally made it to my room on the 2nd floor overlooking the poolnice
we like it alot
i would definitely recommend this place to my friends probably not to my grandma or grandpa but then again i wouldnt want to stay with my grandparents anyway
we will never come back to this restaurant
sorry but we had no time nor interest in a timeshare presentation no matter what they were offering as an incentive
i thought three complaints to staff would have prompted some action i even spoke with the kids and parents who seemed to not care at all  great parenting skills
but every morning we felt she was breathing down our necks to get in the rooms and clean
a salon manicure include them rubbing lotion on your hands and lower arms for 50 so not worth it
the continental breakfast was great  including waffles bagels breakfast meats coffee and healthy options too
staff was professional courteous and accommodating
overall i wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone i know
the place is old and needs to be torn down and rebuilt
we will be back to renew our vows in years to come
my family kept asking me how they knew me so well because the decorations were exactly what i wanted
its just not anything special  rooms are not good at all and the rest of the resort is mediocre at best
great watering hole after five miles of hiking in the mcdowells
they had 10 min bet pai gow poker tables my gambling obsession
theres a real sense of privacy to be had when youre in a hotel that cant even be accessed without valet or a key card to enter the premise
die mbel sind immer noch einfach aber ok und einen flachbildfernseher gibt es inzwischen auch wie auch wlan
the backyard area is so cute and looked so posh
how do you build the worlds most expensive hotel and not think this through beforehand
we booked and paid for a suite
they allow pets and it shows
i love that they allow you to bring in your own food and drinks
when a sandwich is good its good
ps it was 35 bucks a person for 3 hours plus a 291 percent taxgratuity also i have friends that do not drink and we still had to pay for them as drinkers including his lil sister who is only 19 another quick side note they dont have non alcoholic beer so i went and bought some to put behind the bar no idea if they charged my friends for those but i wouldnt be surprised since its completely unorganized
very good but the sandwiches are premade
much less sleep
service is friendly and efficient
i just went in here and spent over 5000 on a whim this place has a lot of things that you normally dont see at a dollar store
resort fee also covered free wifi
and that is what gives them a  solid  five  stars
this hotel continues to win me over each time i stay
i regret it now
this was a great choice and we will be coming back next time we are in town
leider ist mit dem grsserwerden und franchisingambitionen von ilovesushi die qualitt auf der strecke geblieben
i like anna f have parents
but the cornbeef the sausage french pudding toast etc was all pretty medicore or the eough sp
the desk lamp gives a glow but very little light
really capacious room
note  fran at the aria mens store is awesome  she is very professional and has great humor
went with 3 other people in my family love how it turned out and i hope the price stays the same i would gladly come back even though its a good 10 miles or more from my house the price is worth it khina and another girl that works there are great and friendly
we were driving a regular sized sedan and felt weird squeezing down the one street they wanted us to park on
finally i witnessed a maid take clean towels from her cart throw them on the floor by the door and then hang them up as clean towels
we tried the beach party and sexism is alive and well where the cost of admittance for a penis is double for that of a bikini
the area just didnt flow well
it said they closed at 2am got here at about 1145pm and they were closed
we did a short hike at sunset right behind the hotel there are signs pointing you in the direction of the exit for the walk  and it was gorgeous
could use an indoor shower in the pool room for cleaning the chlorine off the body but hey you have one in your room anyway
they have phenomenal memory of every customer and they do everything with pride
when i showed up i got another
i did not like it sorry bouchon
youd think with the money they pull in theyd have the funds to at least keep up the placehonestly its not that hard 5 minutes cleaning an area every other couple hours does wonders
so thankful i found mike
i especially enjoyed the low background noise  no ear straining required to have a conversation
overall id give this hotel 35 stars out of 5 we would stay here again
we had enough in the name of this vegan crap in addition to having this crap in the humidity of this dungeon
i took my time looking at the cards picking out the ones that tug at my heart sleeve
chairs in room were like half broken super strange
the food was just too underwhelming
the bartender was very attentive and the bareating area was exceptionally clean
bonne carte  menutapas assiette de charcuteries 15  pieuvre tempura 950  cassoulet de canard 25 ils ont beaucoup de choix de vins rougesblancsross mousseux  whiskyspiritueux
75 fat and 25 meat  along with very dry and cold macaroni and cheese
the service was excellent and not to mention the sushi
went here yesterday to order lunch to go
it was truly disappointing
like me just older and not aging well
this is a party hotel booked solid with birthday parties wedding groups baccalaureate groups and bday groups too
it does fit six people if you get the bella suite easy
thanks again prima
we got totally ripped off tonight
we ended up taking a taxi cab back to the tropicana which cost us almost 34
as soon as we got to our first room we noticed there was a wet spot on the carpet and the entry way bathroom smelled like a urinalperiod smelled like something was rotting in there
everything has been pretty decent and the people that work here are super nice
we were seated quickly our server was terrific and the food and beer were great
the closet was in the bathroom which i found a bit inconvenient but we made it work
most of the staff we have interacted with have been polite and helpful
4 cute ambiance
not all americans wants unlimited piles of food
you will have a much better time
no coffee in room  at all
then i told her that since the coupon covered that meal i would get it
i have to say i was extremely disappointed
good for an early or late lunch but beware the busy times
both parking garages were enclosed and somewhat secured
great place with a lot for the kids to do for a reasonable price
i think its the best way to experience the night life
first while the accommodations are fine there is a 10 per day charge for wifi
they should invest in a better version of it or have the platform be less elevated so that the performers can safely perform the scene
thank you nice waiter dude and sorry you have to work with that trash
everything is far and the signs were so not helpful either
service was not particularly attentive
the adult pool is great
the lobby and public spaces are really cool with an eclectic modern decor worthy of the newest cruise ships
the actors were very charismatic and very good at bringing the audience into it
there is a piano in the lobby for some nice tunes coming intoout of the hotel
came here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by this joint in rocky river
we were allowed two desserts for the group
please open in raleigh
food was tasty
the shower floor was spongy and the jacuzzi tub didnt work
there are plenty of outlets everywhere for your electronics and water pressure in the shower isgreat
when asked about a gluten free menu my man tells me when you take the gluten out you basically destroy the dish
very sad to learn that as i loved the place
we got there before they opened but they still let us come inside and wait in the ac until they were ready to go
this hotel is perfect for the budget traveler
we will not be going back and we will not recommend others to stay there
then they told me my room wasnt ready yet even though i called and requested early check in in advance
decent food cons 1
we stayed in one of the penthouse suites thanks for a travelzoo deal and it was great on the 30th floor with a balcony with the view of wet republic and the mgm pools
the mint is an interesting building guess it used to be a bank and now its turned into this restaurantbarclub i have to tell you i loved it i like the way its decorated the place has a good vibe and the patio area is nice like the lounge sofa seating
the  14 breakfast burrito in sids this morning was pretty much the worst i have ever tasted my son agreed
my favorite was the cubs
served us hot tea upon arrival greeted us by name when we walked in the curtains opened automatically when we walked into our room and they even have a valet closet
the inside was clean
the next day we tried eating it although it was good it was pretty cold so hard to really enjoy
on the plus side theres an elevator that goes right up to cosmo
i also love that every room is a suite with a kitchen
2 the pillows are bad
and the coup de gras was the mandatory 20 tip they added on to our bill
clientele seemed to be a bit older than i usually see in bars i frequent around 4060 years old was the average age
security shouldnt be underrated
i really liked the honey tabasco barbeque sauce that came with the chicken
lmao i rest my case
i dont want to be penalized for getting a single scoop
even though the ac wasnt working well the first day they made sure that it was up and running for the next 2 nights we had
stayed here because i got it for a good rate
i still wish they would open up some shops in southern california
its really not as small as some lead you to believe if you take your time to savor all the aquatic displays and the over your head water tunnel is a dream
nice job posy people
at last owner asked every single one of us for membership card for discount purpose
theyre wonderfully opulent affairs with amenities like a full bath soft beds and lots of space perfect for pregaming
either ventilation issues or doors need to be opened
i had so much fun here they were playing hip hop and mainstream music some old school as well
the chairs all around the pool are either located on the edges of it or overlooking the strip
this hotel has genuinely earned its overall rating of 15 stars
everything was great except one of the two party attendants
honestly this was 99 fat
if youre not gambling the conservatory is a great place to walk through and enjoy the sights
there were no spare rolls and we had to call down to get one which took over a half hour
just seen they were on yelp
they essentially payed me to win who can complain about that
regrettably this store seems to be sliding down the western slope
ill give you a hint it has nothing to do with you having bowling alleys in your place
the only negatives i could think of were that checkin and checkout took awhile and the resort fees but hey i guess all the hotels are doing that now
unfortunatley i should have asked where on lvblvd are you located
when you go out of town  leave your husband home to work but dont want him to starve this is who you call
the menu itself is boring and like any other boring restaurant
i couldnt believe they still had these kind of tvssmh
got to our rooms on the 24th floor and had an amazing view of the bellagio fountains
the rooms are always spacious and have comfy beds and nice bathrooms
basically i got a sorry lady
this is the worst place ive ever stayed and ive stayed in some seedy places
is that weird for pancakes
i will never forget the memories from club 28341 haha
party america is now closed
came here to see a show here and had to go back to our hotel very interesting place
clientele is never sketchyweirdoffwaiting for you to bowl so they can run away with your belongings type people
while the salad bar was always stocked i did not come here to spend 2999 to eat salad
wir warens sehr zufrieden
they are truly accommodating and professional
he asked for sunflowers not sure what he paid and he doesnt know ive left this review but i was pretty disappointed
probably one of the hotels that i will visit more then once when going to montreal
you couldnt ask for better
i felt like i was sleeping on a cloud
ok so my bill at the cabana was 50090 for tip so basically 9000 is not enough she felt i needed to give her more
and their marketing is suck they basically told you that only if you have breakfast you can get tickets for the blue man shows discounted
like most of the bigger vegas hotelsresorts pretty much everything you need is under one roof so you dont need to go anywhere else
stayed at the luxor for 5 nights for memorial day weekend 2009  the pros of staying at the luxor is that they have a food court quiznosmcdonalds starbucks etc
so im out 300 worth of stuff i bought assuming the vouchers would cover it
the staff was very friendly and helpful
amy from the discovery desk was amazing when there was an issue with the times for our tickets
these growing boys were just happy to be eating
then she got her manager and he started spewing about a deal he had for veterans and military personal and gave us a lower number come to find out they gave this military discount to everyone who said no way to treat our military we said no again he gave us another deal
this place is a bakers dream
it was not bad i am just not sure if i will ever come here again
i just play tournament poker so ill give my impressions of the two 65  5 addon games i played in
they finally called casino manager who refunded my 5
the response was that no for existing members the point costs do not change once you are in the club
this is a special spot a must try
our non smoking room smelled like smoke constantly
the lattes from baby cakes are super
if youre looking to ball out of control and need a super fancy room exactly in the center of the strip this isnt it
the lobby is nice but the rooms are a bit older
i wonder where those fees go to
so nobody knew my painting
they did give us a pool key so that we could stay and enjoy the pool after co
the chili topping was okay but not fab and the dirty jerz is just your typical hot dog
the menu also stayed the same
they do a swing catch  release off the bar into the hands of a very well trained  professional trapeze artist
our room at vdara wasnt bad it was just kinda dull
thats not tenderness on a bbq scale
ok now i have seen this trailer  smoker jjs louisiana bbq with a simple stand set up at the walmart the last few weekends and each time i have passed it by
wir mussten verdutzt feststellen dass auf der zu die seeeehr berschaubar war in grossen lettern stand
dj murphy is great and really good
when i go back to vegas and i will i will be making dinner reservations here again and again and again
today was my first time eating here and honestly this was some of the best food i have had in while
today we got to feel a star fish a lobster and a sea urchin
he just kept telling me to call valet from the room and press the valet button talking to me like i was an idiot
definitely coming back
why five stars
we informed the waiter and he apologized and took it off the bill
my peacock tail was smothered in glittery paint
the hotel is clean and modern
it is midnight on saturday night and they are all just starting to feel normal
the room was the smallest one but very quiet clean tastefully furnished and fine with us
performers such as john butler warren haynes and trey anastasio have provided me with memorable shows and performances that i will remember for a life time
they have both experience and customer service on their side
2 the handle to the bathroom door in our room was badly misplaced and i ended up getting a deep cut on my finger because of it
this involved a motorized boat ride lasting again only 5 minutes and then floating back to the original departure spot
i guess theyre rebuilding inside so we had to walk sooooooooooo much just to find parking find the elevators and wait about 10 mins because so many darn people are trying to get on the elevators then we had to go downstairs and walk a couple more minutes until we found the check in then we waited to check in walked a couple more minutes to find the escalators to go back up the stairs find the elevators to take us to our room go down this long hall until finally we get to our room
if you dont like spicy food ask for no peppers
step 3 eff it
lucky nothing was stolen but still very shady feeling
i dont think im being out line for docking them points for this but it was offensive to receive my tasty latte in that kind of cup
ask to talk to the manager but no one is available roll our luggage back the registration area and waiting for another hour then they finally give us the octavius room with 2 beds after we just stand there complaining to them
the pine nuts added an interesting textural contrast
random note model cindy crawfords husband rande gerber owns cherry
found a great deal  30night  13 resort fee online for a weekday night stay passing through vegas
we had to call for new towels toilet paper tissue toiletries etc
verdict would def
so i checked them out to see if something was temporarily wrong with my taste buds or or     and it seems they are improvingmy taste buds the chocolate or maybe both
they helped me try on the dress i loved that they had and i was convinced it was the dress
get it right or get out of the business
when i said that i order this every time and there is usually more
id hate for others to think its not good and not return
it also included a kitchen and living room for a really good price
the lasagna by the way is the best i have ever tasted
okay one sandwich is named after someone
they made me feel at home
overall the food may not blow you away but its a reliable place if youre in the neighbourhood and dont want to risk a bad experience
the price was acceptable for the amenities and central location
we asked to upgrade to a suite and was told they had it available which made me slightly happier
mostly because i spend so little money here and almost always get ugraded to a suite at no extra charge
i wonder why it wasnt there the first night
if it wasnt for the shitty service i probably would have given this hotel 5 stars
my limo was running a little late but at no point did i feel rushed at all it was no big deal to them and if it was i sure didnt know it
the short of it is the rating is totally deserved
its great for any meal or occasion whether you want to grab something to go and walk around the south side and eat it or sit down for a meal
also i dont know how she makes those cookies but you must get one at least one for an after lunch treat
he didnt really explain how he pulled it off other than the last one where they put up the sign behind the girl reading the joke
the pai gow tables have lcd displays that can tell you what hand you have before you even look at the cards
texas nothing is small so this is false advertisement as i got 6 chips
make this right caesars
she was an excellent listener and met our expectations on all fronts
information we provided to the manager  1
but the food proved there was no reason to be
parts of the pool gets shade by 5p
apparently they dont sanitize or clean very well
the setting in the miracle mile shops is interesting
see ya hooters
something conciliatory at least
our bed was about 15 feet from camelback road  a very busy road and loud at night
thick enough to not get soggy yet still soft and not grainy at all
never thought about mixing the two in a sandwich but i was pleasantly surprised
its not pretty
ive been going to north ever since it opened
he didnt get any sleep because of his coughing and i didnt get any sleep because of his coughing and me worrying about him
the cosmopolitan charges even more money for a smaller room
zugegebenermassen hatten wir keine reservierung und haben trotzdem noch einen tisch bekommen der allerdings ziemlich klein und auch auf eine stunde begrenzt war
i had a very nice pot of coffee with a scone etc and my fellow business visitor also had a similar light tea from the extensive menu
i just finished the wild mushroom ragu stack with truffle oil and i am still licking my lips in an attempt to savor the flavor
they get the audience to participate a little bit and try to have people dancing by the end
the downstairs dance floor was crowded but the roof wasnt too bad
i stayed here with a group of 6 girls
if youre here to party might as well find a nice resort in tucson az
i have read this recipe in the cookbook and all the steps that go into making it and now i can see why its all worth all that work
lettuce and tomatoes always fresh
ive also had cheese tortellini which is what youd expect but the lasagna here is very good too and filling
you get what you pay for
i met a really beautiful young lady but she was too intoxicated to hold a conversation
they gave me my meal on the house
we came here and he a blast
the room was overall very clean
i dont recommend this place to anyone
the sandwich was to die for
my room was clean and adequate
as it was i spent 200 per night
but the salads are all superbasic and the soups are limited to two a day in bizarre flavors like cheesebacon or boring standbys like chicken and rice
i was boomer cause i puked a lot since i was pregnant haha also the lady was really nice about explaining things even though my cousin kept crackin jokes
during the act we never had an issue hearing penn or other guests from the speakers
but once you show up they have any excuse to deny you and can away with it because its in the fine print
he had always been gracious even when the venue was packed to practically less than standing room as in the reposado elite events case or at huge events spanning across multiple locations as at the toronto comic arts festival tcaf
what a great hotel in a very convenient location
there are so many weddings happening here both indoors and outdoors that some of your less observant guests may actually get overwhelmed and join the wrong one
in total i spent 34 hours in algonquin and the bus ride took the most of the day
western and asian foods no complaints here
i am a solo female traveler who has traveled all over the world and stayed in all manner of sketchy accommodations and in the future id probably pay 23x as much for a nicer place
it ended up being 3 songs for a bill
i didnt feel unsafe or anything but i wouldnt walk around at night either
we got a valpak coupon in the mail for 5  child for your first visit
i was so excited to stay at the sls and finally had my chance when my husband and i decided to spend a long weekend in vegas
we will definitely use this company again and you should too
i will never go again
christopher our bartender showed the highest sense of hospitality we have ever had
pay a little more money  stay somewhere else
to make it worse they dont give you an itemized receipt
these folks were so kind
thank you for offering your delicious bavarian pretzels with beer cheese when im in a desperate need of one too
and its close to the light rail
overall they do not know how to treat their paying customers and are really lazy
maybe if enough folks in our group voted for it
d   t i p s   the prices are pretty reasonable for the atmosphere the location and the quality of food
this seems to be a very prejudiced place
the large tv rotates to face either the bed or sitting area
first and last time ever attempting to go there
the cook couldve used a thermometer to check for doneness
other hotels like the wynn in vegas does ask for a form of id when releasing a vehicle
talk about a crew that hated their job and was equally as unprofessional
needed 2 beds to sleep 4 people
the soda machine by the ice machine is your only hope
gourmet sandwiches come prewrapped out of the cold case freshly made and served on a six inch length of french stick bread
cant wait to go back
i went on a sunday night and it was not very busy at all the bar wasnt even half full
we have stayed at this hotel twice now and had good experiences both times
i must say if you are a clean freak its best to bring your own bath towel
i loved how its served with sauteed onions and red and green bell peppers and marinara sauce on the side
schne gegend und insgesamt empfehlenswert
oh  they really should induct the monkees
wish i was young again good price and good service
the hotel is sleek and modern but who cares when you cant sleep or get a even a moderately edible breakfast on your way out
just no it was my husband and my first trip to vegas with kids and we saw a couple of articles stating circus circus was good with kids  no its ghetto old and not kid friendly at all
only if it was cheaper than everywhere else
had a shrimp burrito came with chips and beans
for the table we ordered waffles which was really good
the main complaint here is the value or to be exact a lack of thereof
i was a bit disappointed at first but we ended up upgrading to a room with a view of the strip which i cant complain about
the front desk were very helpful and courteous and not put out at all when we asked if we could stay 1 extra night
our waitress cc was awesome
the employees were laid back but were available when needed
we successfully completed them both but the part i liked about this place is they dont give clues unless you ask for them
the luxor appears not to want anyone to talk with them
the night was fun and up beat and the timing was perfect
oh yeah
its not the best hotel in vegas but its also not the worst
worst hotel in vegas
i wish they had more ipa type beers on tap
we got a double bed suit and it was very spacious and accommodated me and my 3 friends
while i didnt experience anything like chris p has mentioned i supposed it might be possible in an environment full of completely wasted yelpers
inexpensive and yummy
wish i brought a bathing suit
i love love love love stevie
i didnt stay here so im just reviewing the casino itself
there was a variety of pools and spas
concierge is absolutely useless
there is aa nice terrace and pool on the 5th floor with spices growing that they use in the restaurants
both times it was packed and the food was good
so we jump on
9 fat bikes were everywhere
it needs to be remodeled
this seems like a cool place but dear merciful heaven above what is the horrible putrid smell that emanates from this place
as promised we had an escort brian meet us outside the club walk us in the club and all the way to the table which was great for vegas newbies like us
its a rubios
my friends and i chose to do the vip tour
first time at this hotel and it was fantastic
the room even supplied an aux wire for our mp3 player
food service staff was also 5 star
beer or hard liquor were better drinking choices
and it was a curly wurly if you catch my drift
we simply couldnt stay in that room for another second let alone to sleep there so we decided to check out after checking in for five minutes
saw some people balling it out getting bottles of grey goose and red bull
samosas nice texture served hot a little heavy on the cinnamon and cardamom for my tastes  3 stars assorted pakora nice spicy kick to the batter  the cauliflower and spinach were especially good  4 stars chicken tikka masala the flavor was right on target  tender chicken  the sauce was creamy buttery goodness  again the portion was small for 1199  maybe 10 small pieces of chicken  flavor  4 stars portion 3 naan hot fresh delicious  4 stars 35 stars over all in my mind rounded up to 4  i would recommend that if you are to try chaupaati that you come for lunch as the prices and portions seem more appropriate
highly recommend this hotel for corporate meetings and my sister and her family enjoyed a stay here in december one year
stayed here for 3 nights while attending the paul mitchell gathering in 2012 the hotel is very nice as well as the rooms
this is always the place we go to hang out when visiting
i went there with some friends and we all liked it
the bedrooms are big enough but would need to be updated
casino shopping different restaurants you name it they have it
you have to simply sit in the front lobby to see the spectacular artwork that has gone into this place
i think there was even a washer and dryer in there
if you drink spirits be prepared to fork out about 1218 a drink
i love las vegas and i love the wynn so when we decided to get married there was no question this was our first choice
it lasted about 2 and a half hours
the staff could not be better everyone who works here is friendly and efficient and really helped us with our business and personal needs
i opted for the bread pudding which was made using nearby prestis donutsyum
waste of money
the finished product was absolutely stunning
they told us that they have never had two
they told us that it is not their fault and they turn down people all the time
as i write this i can hear the bass from the hotel bar in my room
you should know they only do one client at a time it seems and they do an amazing job
it cost about 63 for a minivan to go from the hotel to downtown toronto since its about a 20 minute drive
the zucchini was served on a wooden board and the waitress came over with a steaming pot of polenta and poured it over the zucchini
they have a rub on them but its indistinct to me
not too bad of a hike unless youre stuck in 104 degree heat
i went here for lunch with my coworkers
surprisingly affordable considering the upscale and modern asthetic
youll find an array of restaurants and visual stimulations
kim will make us custom clay vases for us for special occasions our customers request
overall i am pleased with my experience at excalibur
leider musste der starbucks oben auf dem tower weichen
service was excellent
the casino is not glitzy and is definitely more subdued than what people are used to on the strip
this has happened the last two times i ordered from this place
i hate  to admit it but their macaroni and cheese surpasses mine
ive been a fan for years i actually bought play with your food a long long time ago
i dont really want to recomence this hotel to anyone either i know the cost is really cheap
us old folks help support your casino and this is the thanks we get
my main course was pan fried trout with roasted almonds and french beans
i dont need a plot  corteo is a dream sequence  la reve doesnt have a clearly articulated plot
the kids loved the rooms and were so darn sweaty
shower in adjacent room made so much pipe noise there was no sleeping past 600 am
the room was clean didnt smell of ass and had a decent view
the hotel is nice and staff is very helpful
went to visit my cousin at the hotel and was charged 15 for parking
but when coming back to sleep at 3amthe music was still going strong and it was loud in the room
my springtime home for baseball peoria sports complex is the best spot
simply loved being here
the coffee for the coffee maker was not refilled
living social and the third party that books the reservations for you pulled the plug and refunded the money
the cable cuts in and out
we contemplated on sleeping with our shoes on and settled on sleeping with all of our clothes on and not showering in the morning because the bathroom was so dirty
so me and my bf ordered a full slab of ribs baby back in the combo with mac n cheese and fried okra as our sides
i work in the heat so the very last thing i want to do is eat in it
for our entrees we ordered the chicken salmon and trout
at subway you can only get it shredded
no i didnt want to leave the room
i dont expect to be treated like royalty but nor do i expect to be treated like a bum off the sttreet
the room was very modern and most importantly clean
maybe having a waiting area not right in front of the door and having the sign say to please sign in will avoid the messy traffic jam
i highly recommend them for real estate photos videos and virtual tours
we arrived here on 040917
above and beyond my expectation of cereal dispensers and stale pastries
despite the price this hotel remains one of my favorite
we happen to be watching as the housekeepers were changing the sheets and found a set of apple headphones in between the top sheet and fitted sheet
then the tuna sandwich4 tiny scoops for a foot long
only did that once
came here with my family and friends
lasagna good but not the best
you are the first face of the restaurant and that means first impression
the ladies in the cafe are not very friendly or helpful
i only got the front desk managers with no other options
comedy shows on sunday nights are funny too
21 per adult and 1595 per kid 212yrs
i must have been hungry
you know its going to be a rough nights sleep when the hotel leaves you ear plugs
when my food arrived the ground beef was under cooked and the hash browns were uncooked on one side and burnt on the other
stayed here over a long weekend in old montreal  the lobby is nice and service was prompt and courteous checking in was simple and quick for me  my room was a little small but very good  clean and comfortable the lobby has a restaurant and bar called z tapas its honestly amazing
their showroom is really old but i got to see don rickles and actually perform with him this last trip so i wont talk shit about the venue too muchlol i will just say thisif you like aria you will hate the orleans
also i payed 165 for  friday  saturday nights and would expect this place to at least include free wireless internet which it didnt
we all looked beautiful and everything stayed put
great first experience
the potato salad in a cup was not bad though
i also appreciate that they menu isnt huge when a place has a billion thing on the menu its impossible to choose they have just enough
as a crafter i prefer it 100x over michaels
never had a crime related problem here
there are not enough classes and i do not understand why you have to pay to attend any of them
first time staying at this location and will definitely not be the last
the bar has limited options
from the time i called to get my initial quote to the time the equipment was picked up i could not have been more impressed with this company
my friends and i couldnt help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission
our driver rudy instilled confidence yet ensured our ride was wild from the first 5 seconds
the checkin process is torturous
go splities with a friend on two sammies
i was really left unimpressed with vegas
i spent over 30000 last night for 3 kids and myself
if you were to take just 1 thing away from this review  be sure to book a fountain view room
clean layout but can be a bit loud
not only was our breakfast sandwich was yummy which im not a breakfast person i ate the whole bacon cheese and egg sandwich
we came here for brunch for our friends bachelorette weekend
on the opposite side of the road where the hotel is located there is sizable strip malllike kind of complex that houses many shops fastfoodchinese takeout places and restaurants judging from the store fronts  signs
the service is also top notch
on the positive side the food is very good
no microwave or coffee maker though
remember one unhappy customer tells ten or more of their friends and family
my waistline maybe not so much if i can help it im never staying at another vegas hotel ever again
loved this place
staff was so helpful and super friendly
its a chain restaurant yet it doesnt feel like one
old not renovated the pool is terrible not up to date at all
beautiful modern and welllit see pics
because it took our food forever to come
now this is becoming a bang head here moment
front desk oh im sorry to hear that
for the location on the weekend at least this is the place to go if you want to not bother with a cover charge
nice meaty sandwiches
then i had to ask for the beef again which left me asking my husband to bring the meal into me at work
room service was great i ordered some room service and it showed up at my door front in 3 minutes
the portions are huge and can probably feed two people
not too busy on a saturday night after a blue jays game tourists piled into the hooters across the street but some regulars were there
first impression on checking  friendly staff
avoid if you can
i slightly preferred the baby backs
they seemed nice and the place was clean with a tasty menu but they really need to learn to accommodate customers
writing on the walls
cant speak to the hotel as ive never stayed here but as far as a casino goes its ok  being off the strip the tables are a little not a lot more reasonable than those on the strip itself
so we asked to speak to the manager who took his time to come up and at one point wanted us to wander around the hotel to find him
there was also a booth set up with sparkling bedazzled cat jewellery  which my friend informed me that i couldnt buy unless i wanted to lose friends
the dj we had moved everything along at our reception smoothly and perfectly
it would easily serve 8 people
im glad i didnt want anymore to drink or i would have been dying of thirst
there was a full kitchen with dishware silverware pots  pans an refrigerator oven microwave etc
an upside is the nicer lobby that was mentioned and i felt the reception was smooth
theres a giant food court upstairs which is awesome for lazy people like me who doesnt want to drive around to get food
3 i ended up sleeping in the chair by my computer because they would not help me change rooms until the following morning
and they put us a few doors down
the lady working at the store saw my fascination and said i can teach you how to make those flowers if you want
the breakfast menu was 46
this could be a deal breaker for some i suppose
i am not sure which location her office uses and i have been to the one on bell ave and it was alright but this place we had a half pepperoni half veggie
i had a skinny one so i can pretend im not getting a boat load of extra calories and it was one of the better ones that ive had
i called the phone number and the worker told me someone would come back to open the store in 5 min
drive back to our hotel was the only complaint as we were slammed around in the back of the minibus like loose marbles
saw skrillex at encore beach club
the pool is small compared to the hotel next door   but refreshing
the hotel is impeccable
we decided to try it out for lunch and once again we were struck by the rural surroundings complete with a gravel driveway
it was relatively cheap so i didnt expect too much from excalibur besides a bed and bathroom since i knew we werent going to be in our room much
there is a shuttle that takes you to the strip so it is easy to get to where the action is on the strip
also  you can bring a cooler full of ice and sealed bottled waters no size limit
my other cousin found pole fitness studio and im so happy that we decided to go here
joey was amazing and very inviting
i used it to reserve the room as well as check in
see below for pros and cons pros  free continental breakfast in the morning  free parking  free shuttle to planet hollywood 4x a day  free shuttle to  from the airport   friendly staff all around cons  pretty old and a bit run down looking  free breakfast is subpar compared to other hyatts  long walk to the strip if you miss the shuttle   room layouts are a bit odd  pool is more like youd find at a motel 8 overall the staff here are what made this stay enjoyable
despite their parking issues its a good hotel
4 courts outdoor
ok the last bit might be a bit harsh
in phoenix so i tried this place and will be back again
the bathroom and towels were very clean and comfortable making our stay here enjoyable with the exception of the unruly kids at night
the room is lovely and the staff was extremely nice but the pool is a joke
no apology or im sorry
i think that the hotel does not want you to stay in the room but to go out to shopping or gaming   i would recommend this hotel
nice quality hotel
i tried four of their sandwiches my favorite being the italian
weve been here a few times and just had my sons 6th birthday party this weekend
i went up to the bar and asked to pay for my food since we never had a server rather just asked a bar tender who was walking by where we should order and told us to tell him what we want and hed place the order
but hey its vegas
what they say they use now is the owners proprietary recipes for both the cookies and ice cream
service wasnt super attentive
i found a rate for 40 on a friday night when the strip was asking for 200  anyways the tower rooms are now all renonvated and are actually very nice
i couldnt believe it well what to expect in an asian casino
my brother received a decent bowl of noodles which smelled great
we would probably not come out of our way to eat here again
service was pretty good
the nice weather stars lighted fountain coupled with great wine great cheese and great company is a sweet moment in life
i highly highly recommend will refer and am definitely looking forward to working together again in the near future
best italian place in phx
big windows in the room with good view
we did not end up finishing the dish because we didnt like the flavour
i left the plaza wondering if i had just accidently stayed  checked out of section 8 of las vegas
i just watched the car in front of me drive away which is probably going to mess up my order
went with my wife and a few friends of ours
the best ive had in a while
while it was good and i ate the entire dish i didnt feel like there was anything exceptional about it
the front desk people are rude
it shoots right at hotel and really really loud
natalie was quick to apologize when i called and added a credit to my account for next time
loved the lake then relaxing under a cabana
after about 15 minutes she found a room for me on the ground floor that faced the entrance to the building where the cars drove in all night
i called right after the wedding to report them being left in the room house keeping said they would look for them and call me back
its fun kind of like a roller coaster ride for shutins
ive been here a few times for their delicious food and coffee and i always receive great service
attended an event here recently
the sauce didnt have any garlic undertone to it so im a bit confused by it
i live in the neighborhood and saw signs for a wedding a few times so one day my mom and i decided to follow those signs to  see what was really going on
one of my favorite goto places
tried their famous wicked spoon buffet  personally wasnt a fan i guess we dont enjoy buffets that much
strawberry yogurt parfait
i said give it time
after explaining the whole situation to the woman at the front desk we spoke to the manager who additionally treated us with disbelief and disrespect and acted like the whole ordeal was our fault
apparently xs is the club in vegas right now i was in the double queen suite and actually spent 25 hours napping in my ridiculously comfortable bed before a legendary dinner at picasso bellagio
mussels not so much
it is quite old and outdated
but when you get the layers of the sauce mixed with the figs and the chantrelle mushrooms it is a ridiculously awesome flavor bonanza in your mouth
we went here to see the visiting daniel tiger exhibit since our child is a daniel tiger addict
it smelled soo bad within 10 minutes being in the room i got a headache
the women at the reservation desk were sweet and helpful
i had a reservation beforehand but was given a table very far away from the buffet all the way on the other side of the restaurant
everything is always fresh
shared a fabulous grilled octopus salad that is perfectly grilled and served warm on a bed of arugula with a great dressing
my younger daughter was still swimming with amber as of june till she mysteriously left the company
the chick at the fd was on her phone texting the entire time i was waiting in the lobby
i highly recommend this place and i promise we will be back
i just checked into this hotel 2 nights ago
when the bride and groom contacted the hotel about reserving a block of rooms for the wedding they were informed of an upcoming renovation that would be completed in may  no problem for the july wedding
ummmmas the hotel authorized the upgrade how in the heck is you are already getting a deal a reason to do nothing about a known issue
this place was off the beaten path and a little tricky to find but im glad we made the trip
super glad we stayed here
we ordered room service for breakfast after the first night which was good but a little pricey
this guy works hard for you day or night to make sure that you experience is unforgettable and exactly what you envisioned for your vegas trip
modern touches and the bartender was super friendly young and knowledgeable
depending on the day you arrive
now thats service for a fast food place
not the same vegas i remember from 97 the free shuttle out front if very convenient
its an empty corridor but at least paris hotel is owned by the same folks and is connected to ballys
the worst of the worst on the strip
the shrimp was so sweet and lobsters was great
i used to frequent it for lunch when i worked in the area
here they dont always come in a cup
v i really liked the modern asian inspired atmosphere and large booths
the biggest problem was that i called a month ahead of time and asked that they touch base with our caterer they gave us a handout with their requirements but wed lost it and they didnt do it until one week before the wedding
staff was very friendly
sang took a very personalized approach to checking each of our rolls and answering questions along the way
and they have a lion show a few times a day where you can watch two lions interact with trainers and have their pictures taken
word of advise
i would use lavish in the future
i purchased 2 chocolate chip cookies and a rice crispie treat for a total of 9
it turns out that i had used my phone to take a bunch of pictures of the room when we got in so i could show familyfriends because it was so nice
we were very excited about our upcoming stay at rumors
be creative and youll be ok vegas isnt all about gambling although i think the casinos would highly disagree
there were several house infused vodkas to pick from as well as garnishes
its been 45 fucking minutes and im a little more than halfway through the line
anywhere must be less ghetto than here
just so you know we did not wait that long because there were no seats
if you like mexican food you must eat here
we paid  220 per night for the weekend
mike was our server and did a standout job especially for a tourist area
great place to hang with family or friends
our window overlooked the side of a building
the rear parking area is also in need of attention as the asphalt is breaking up in several areas
the waiter wouldnt let us split it up and take individually so it was difficult on that end
what a waste of 1100
cons  the lights by the pool at night extremely obnoxious
and they are well known for it
always a good time
so on his way back down he said he heard more noise and came back to issue us our second warning
i got the upgrade
great placejust look for the dealsor download the app and use your 40 off coupon
breakfast is typical bagels cereal waffles juice coffee etc
it was the total opposite of what good customer service is about
i grew up on a lot of rb motown and funk so this was a great place to catch up on a lot of classic rock i missed out on as a kid
great atmosphere and decor
we definitely got a bit too excited and ordered too much for our party of 4 we started with the large seafood platter which consisted of lobster clams oysters and mussels
there were good things about the resort and some things that could use improvement
you do need to reserve the shuttle in advance by calling the front desk
when she then decided to order a muffin and asked what kind they had he read off the list
checking in was easy and the staff was half the age of circus circus
if i had not tried to order a drink at the bar and order dinner in the dining room i would have given this place 4 stars
we came back to get some wine corks to decorate our homemade wine table pattern after theirs
soap operas and news playing on small tv
we got a room on the 24th floor near the lounge with a great view ot the lv strip
the staff was warm friendly and very accomodating
of course the next day was movein day for the illini so everything was booked for the night
the  pancakes were big and fluffy juice from the blueberries on top allowed good lubrication
decent size casino the buffet fine and the place is much brighter than even 2 years ago
we love it
the morning food service was a great way to start the day popcorn snack at night was a nice touch
the 3 performers were so kind to talk to us afterwards and let us take pictures with them
marissa you rocked it all night
strong and not really what i was expecting in a wontonwhole dinner sucked
i like the bathroom and the table in the room
the entire staff was very pleasant and helpful
then when we returned to our room our key didnt work
just plain yuck
the staff was helpful and friendly
large luxury suites canal shoppes beautiful decor and a very large sports bar
in my mind i doubt it  out loud yes i know
though our room was totally kick ass and very clean
a place to impress
also walk down the staircase a few times if you have time they are beautiful clearly this hotel was made before elevators and while they are nice the stairs are just gorgeous
when i think of where i want to eat german food doesnt exactly jump to the front of the line but after going to the waldhorn  im definitely a fan and to have a german restaurant in charlottepineville is a real treat
we came here for my sister and brotherin laws vow renewal and it was amazing
if we could flood the suggestion box maybe we together could make that happen
the beginning starts with this way off strip place has about as much class as schools do in summer time
it will totally tug at your heart strings the beginning especially
we will be coming back to the restaurant at a later time thats for sure
so much better than dickeys or famous daves where we only visited once each
it had a rich texture that was not overwhelming but enough sweetness for those who dont have a sweet tooth to enjoy it
she is also very flexible she met me half way a couple of times when i borrowed her chalk board and she also helped me by suggesting alternatives to certain things that would be more in our budget
the best thing about this place is the shops
what i got was an event manager that yelled at me several times and in fact rushed me out because she wanted to go home
there were so many cockroaches that you couldnt see the walls
from there however it all went downhill
the pink glass cantilevered room was a hit with guests and more enjoyable at night than by day
the steak came by itself then you had to add 15 sides
intimate room yet with an ikea flair do note the parking space is located across the street dundas st underground level
few hours i came back for an hour or so to get ready then headed out again for about 5 hours
the attitude of the front desk attendant was just oh you dont like people trying to enter your room in the middle of the night
i dont have to eat here havent been back since
i understand how it works with the tables but it would have been nice to be able to afford to gamble at the hotel im staying at
my boyfriend had the challah french toast and said it was amazing
at least the bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet if you like the aloft style and need to be near the airport its not a bad spot but not my first choice either
back  forth chillin on the patio chairs  in the pool drinking my frozen alcoholic drink while enjoying the las vegas sun
our waiter was very pleasant didnt pressure us to order drinks and gave us suggestions that were genuine ie
though it was busy it was quiet by 10pm
however i did find that syrup was totally unnecessary
it seems like everyone is welcome as it should be
hot dogs asian italian etc
the cupcakes were delicious
i finally made it to the earl
literally with an empty table in front of me
i ordered the french salami sandwich which was good
what bothers me with some restaurants is their blatant disregard for following code and safety of their people
worst was the alarm that went off at 1025 pm and continued for thirty minutes even though the recorded voice with  the alarm said not to evacuate
when i opened the door i was impressed by the size of the room
my friends got married here on may 1st
it is literally right across the street
the only problem is that the pool is a long walk from the rooms and the crowd is certainly far from beautiful i will spring the extra 50 bucks for the paris pool or 100 for a pool with eye candy  but if eye candy is not your goal you should stay here the location and price is good
i am lactose intolerant and its tragic when i cant get a sweet treat with friends at ice cream places sherbet can be so
check in was ok they ripped me off on uscad exchange what hotel wouldnt
croque madame i had high expectations after reading great reviews about this but was slightly disappointed
since it is such a new hotel i wanted to also experience the newness of it but dust and cobwebs really turned me off
we started trying to get a crib at 1140 pm when we arrived
i wish i could just ask these guys reallywhat was your problem
white chocolate mocha madness with energizer and b12
there was candle wax dripped all over our table that no one had cleaned off
although im a local ive actually staycationed here a couple times and recommend staying here to friends coming into town who have the finances to do so
maybe ive been lucky the security outside is nice and the garage is close
but overall id definitely come back if i couldnt afford anything better
after a noticeable drop in quality i started ordering elsewhere
this included the head of security and the manager on duty
this place is probably hell
from the moment we arrived we had an excellent experience
i stayed at this hotel for 3 days in april 2016 with my partner and sister and we had one of the greatest experience
the room was quiet comfortable and had a nice view of camp randall
after 13 years the suites are showing their age
has dirty  hall ways
aka that ceiling
got sucked in to a timeshare presentation since thats what the property is
i am so thankful that we got to experience this hotel and am proud to have this business so close to home
at least dont stay here
breakfast was included in the price of the room so it was astonishing to find that both the food and the service were impeccable
they were very accommodating
the manager was apologetic and made compensatory overtures which were appreciated
selbst nach unserer beschwerde kehrte nicht sofort ruhe in der kche ein
we ordered a club sandwich with twister fries and a bbq platter comes with 2 sides
i reccommend going to this place the prices are reasonable 1020 for entrees plus a few more expensive items
the biergarten is a great space and its a mustsee for outoftown visitors
then doors to go in to the bedroom king bed and two bathrooms again
pool is pretty meh
this week it was vino  canvas a wine and painting party which contained no wine unless it was in the acrylic set we were using
amazing sandwiches and very unique
a good 60 yards or more from where i paid
i think the price point was reasonable and it was a good unique sandwich
no further followup no nothing
i however was travelling for work and there is no work space in the room
the staff at the hotel was very nice and helpfull
way too much smoke
my wife tagged along so i knew i also wanted something a little nicer than normal because it would be a kid free get away
i do not recommend and i would never stay here again
springs preserve had a 100 entry fee on veterans day and after visiting we were glad we didnt pay full price
the long bar is awesome and they play music that will make you dance
this place is better enjoyed with a group over aps and cocktails
i would recommend this to anyone staying in vegas
best scene when the main platform tilts and rotates and warriors begin to attack by shooting arrows at the tilting platform
the basic rooms are motel 6 like and the select rooms are very nice they have hard wood floors nice bath rooms etc
staff was wonderful complimentary breakfast was good but could use more seating
i made it specifically clear when i reserved my room through caesers that i needed two beds
but all told this place is a gem and i expect it to continue to grow into the neighborhood meeting spot
what can i say
what really stood out to me the last time was the smoked salmon hash
the monte carlo casino is also a good one  plenty of tables  slot machines
all i can is wow   the villa was amazing
my wife and i were able to get into 3 different clubs for free with no hassles and we even got three free drinks for light included
not sure about the service but they brought a ironboard soon after we called
hotel got us on the guest list for the bank  bellagio which means that the 30 cover was free
she then left security guard came and ask me if anybody was hurt security guard was told that there was a biohazard situation my 93 years old mother has soiled the sheets  huh security guard has severe problems communicating with maid 9pm  room was finally service except they left no towels
not much door clearance in the bathroom hard to maneuver around in such a small space   ac blew ridiculously cold air in one spot and the air never circulated as i mentioned this hotel was just fine and certainly served its purpose a bed to sleep in a place to shower and a rest stop in between running around eating and drinking
chompies is fabu
they were not accommodating in the least and were threatened several times to be kicked out because we wanted to speak with the manager on duty
they own the parking across the street but in order to park there you have to at least have  50 comp points in your players card
i am from seattle a city not famous for good jewish delis
we spent two nights there and spent a ton of time in their amazing swimming pool
we swore off the state fair and had not returned
the staff is mostly asian so didnt have a prayer communication with them in english
but you cant swim after 10
this place has a great selection and everything i have tried has been top notch
i stayed here for my 21st birthday
the food was good
great atmosphere super professional and friendly staff
wonderful wine list cuisine to die for and exceptional service
plenty of good parking and lots of fun at excalibur
when i want a sandwich and subway is only a block away ill gladly drive 30 minutes for my schlotzskysits a no brainer
its definitely a place to check out
this buca di beppo is one of several in a chain of italian restaurants that are owned by planet hollywood
its also very convenient because its one of the first major hotels you hit as you travel northbound on the 15 into vegas
this one was a bit hard to find at 9pm but when we got here check in was fast and parking was easy
she showed no professionalism or remorse
no apology or some type of compensation for my lack of sleep due to the fact they did not follow up on my complaint from saturday
luxor room 4147 has some bad juju going on
hand written lyrics on scratch paper original pressing records buddy hollys glasses stage costumes i love that shit
we only experience that here and there in bits
it was pretty good if you like mai tais your in for a treat
will definitely have happy hour here one day too
here its all included vault fridge in a spacious quiet room with nice golf course view
the mandalay bay resort  casino saved my 41st birthday
so i call front desk once again to let them know we still had dirty sheets and they said they would send some new ones
so this place is fine in the day
i think it is long overdue for a cleaning
you can tell how popular it is by the long long lines that this place has
this was our first time  here and we will be coming back soon with my parents
the parking lot is clean with a nightly security guard watching over cars parked in the lot and doing his rounds on the motel grounds i felt safe and secure sleeping in the motel and leaving my car parked outside in the lot
everything is made to order
super hip joint where you order and pay they give you an order number card on a stand and you choose your seat on the bar booth with velvet fabric couches or outside in the fresh air
this spot is so gross
in the last 3 years i have been to an average of 3 weddings per year and the wedding at pear tree definitely stands out not only because of the beautiful location but because the staff and food were excellent as well
i think i know how those key cards work  i didnt earn my status without practice
we were led into the room blindfolded which really helped to add to the mystery
this place is amazing
very organized and i appreciated how attentive they are at keeping it clean and making sure everyone gets 5 star treatment
hiro may have completely ruined sushi for me as this place and the sushi chef hiro are so good that i dont think any other sushi will ever compare
the cosy comfy seats and sofas are perfect to sit back drink tea or wine and knit the night away
we called for extra blankets and pillows they did not have any
a program advocate then took my number and promised to call me back after discussing with the hotel manager
my husband and i checked in late on a friday night and the only rooms left were suitesand so we were upgraded to a magnificent suite overlooking the adult pool and camelback mountain
ordered food from cafe to take to our room
the food was delicious and the portions are huge
well no reason to ignore the obvious nonetheless
we have been to several parties there
i stayed at the manor section of circus circus
hint if you do stay here you can escape the smoke if you have a drink in the mexican restaurant down at the pool level
the canal shoppes at the venetian are a great shoppingdining experience also
his deep base is bad ass but not consistent and churning out disjointed high pitched noise that you cant dance to at 3am  when the party should be jumping hardcore is a big no no
i dont think i could have dreamed it up
valentines weekend i paid 75 a night and they upgraded us to an executive suite the room was very modern too except for the bathroom
the only downfall was the wait in line
as the person checking us into palazzo stated all the hotels have been cutting their amenities and reducing what you get while increasing the prices
we were told we could sit immediately which was nice to hear but we decided to go upstairs and enjoy a drink before we sat down at the table
til this day i will either stop at the south point palms and even the airport for a quick shoe shine
soap felt so rough and hard it was like washing with a bar of clay
now on sundays its 2 bucks before 2pm to get in it use to be free before 11am
my hotel room is decent
i loved it need pics  let me know
when you walk in the bar the vibe is the same
oh and i cant forget the passion fruit juice
you probably remember how sad you feel for those drivers inching forward once every few minutes on a saturday night as youre walking past a whole mile of them on your way to marquee
this establishment deploys a sensor motionbodyheatwhatever thermostat to determine if someone is in the room
we stayed at the tower suites
the positives of this hotel is that they have free wifi a complimentary light breakfast from 69am i wasnt able to check this out a fitness room in hotel restaurant and ample parking in the lot
merchandise kept neatly organized with prices displayed clearly
i did enjoy the baths and hammam or whatever because i always do
and ben you were the beginning of a horrible weekend
the vibe inside the restaurant was good too
he took one sip of it and claimed it was glorious
our instructor was dominic and our bartender was jordan
proof the chef knew what he was doing
food was delicious though i dare say i would have like more pork products than steaks
however my family mostly all won at least over 700
it is a classy place but it still manages to create an atmosphere that is incredibly warm and inviting
i will say though those ribs might be 3 star but thats because my expectation of ribs are so high and rarely met
the food was great but julia was by far one of the best waitresses we have ever had
boy was i wrong
my first thought
everything is walking distance and starbucks is jusssst around the corner
inexpensive and great people
this place is clean and the staff is friendly
they also were charging quite a bit for the cabana that were next to the pool and that put me off a little bit as well
would not recommend it
we came to relax and have a place to rest before our flight out the next day
the restaurant faces 36th street vs indian school so youd have to know its there its not a place youd stumble upon
meaning they opened the safe for a random person without checking id
i do like to venture out and check the vegas sights now and again but when i come back at 5am its so nice to walk into the always friendly hard rock
the owner even had the audacity to ask me which hotel i had made a new reservation withlong story short the extra star is solely based on the fact that i got my money back
note to selfcall ahead
we also ordered potatoes brava which were red potatoes that were supposed to be crispy which they werent and i asked for more sauce and the server brought out palmorodo tomatosauce that looked nothing like what was on the potatoes
if you are looking for something for someone and you dont know what to getthis is your place
looking into the dining area there were tons of empty tables
the new promenade is convenient for shopping or eating
the food is definitely interestingwe tried rabbit meat and venison
over several years i keep coming back to a1 studios because no matter how different the projects are the results have always produced the intended results
it is home to the ignite lounge diablos yusho and just outside is one of my favorite pizza stops 800 degrees
if you ever want to veer from the norm while in vegas get yourself a ticket or tickets to springs preserve enjoy some fresh air art and garden scenery
nice hot water to quench the thirst
the coleslaw was ok but didnt match up to the mac and cheese or cornbread but we wanted to have a vegetable and it added a nice crunch to the meal
i could have just eaten the inside of the sandwich forever
parking my first 2 trips here i was confused with their parking as i hate valet  waiting 1530 minutes for your car is no bueno
all the restaurants were closed wednesday by 10pm except the cold sandwichbreakfast place fortuna
i was in 5th stage rem sleep at 2 am but one of the other guys said the addict was walking and stomping up down the middle of the room when he came in
the rio suite hotel and casino is one of the more successful casinos off the strip
when this place is full it has to be booming loud and hard to hear
clean and well maintained
wir haben schon viele dieser schweineschmalze in anderen husern gegessen aber dieses ist fr uns das absolute highlight
done and complete in less than 5 min
i was so excited to stay here and it was totally worth it
i suppose you do get what you pay for
we come here probably once a week or so before a movie and the happy hour is great
the ribs here are awesome
service  amenities the front desk and concierge staff are great  friendly welcoming and helpful
we have been multiple times
the cheese enchiladas are good but not great
fitting 4 in the a unit would be doable but very tight working best if you were planning to do little more than crash in the unit
the lobster bisque is absolutely to die for and the portobello mushroom sandwich is fab
the food was great but our server lindsey was even greater
instead he didnt engage in conversation and seemed reluctant to give us the room we had reserved
so overall i absolutely cannot wait to come back to pittsburgh
every table was filled
poolside service took forever and some orders were missed
regardless when i first found this service i immediately thought theres a catch
the employees werent mean i just think they didnt want to help with the rock wall and would rather visit with each other insteadnot sure how long you can stay in business that way
fortunately i found the confirmation that consisted of about a 10 digit number
back for my second visit  i was amazed on a rainy saturday afternoon  how crowded you were
but since it is for her state of well being we enrolled her
he even allowed us to suggest a location outside on a scorching hot day to take some additional landscape pictures
i will never step foot in that store ever again
the room was descent size with a bath tub and shower
ive been to this dave and busters twice now
the whole wedding reception was smoother
i cant wait until its time to have another cupcake
we chose this place for the pet friendly accommodations
in that time  another individual that was  in our group on the trip with us  was on their way to the room and happened upon this situation
we truly loved this nightly
only stayed one night
wasnt as good as i had thought
i love that that give you a plate of pickles to chomp on while you look at the menu and wait to order
lighting the lighting in this place was noteworthingly awful it made doing our makeup much more difficult
i still give them 5stars
we stayed the 2 days just prior to new years and our rate pretty much inclusive was around 13000 a day
its the best
itll get you to mgm within 15 min
the hotel is conveniently located right in between the strip and downtown so you dont get the traffic and madness of either one
it was tough after a long day of walking all over the strip to get to our floor and have to walk down a loooooooong hall
we used amici this morning for our company new years brunch and wow was the food delicious
high prices to keep the sweatshirts out
the only thing that kept me from giving this place a one star was they had free internet
i loved this hotel employees were nice at check in  i was able to check in early to my room without any problems
lucked out with a room facing the strip and enjoyed amazing panoramic views from the 19th floor
hey better yet the paris across the street may score lower but they are cheaper with great views and better staff  from our experience
the room was very clean and updated 12332 the decor was sleek and modern the view was decent we could see the mountains the delano and luxor
i guess you get what you pay for
by far the best experience weve had in vegas
avoid at all costs until management gets it rightmy first time i chalked up to working the kinks out because it was their first week i give it a few more weeks and it was worse for starters the menu is deceiving and doesnt contain enough info to explain what each thing comes with
did i say the gym sucked
everything about the building is hip chic and fashionablei really enjoyed every minute
then after reading a little more about the place i find that it has a great reputation and has been around forever
i will definitely recommend your class to everyone i know
i was surprised by how minty it was
aria  genius
i got the pizza genovese which was wonderful
after checking out the neighbor casinos in the area i realize that i definitely chose to slum it a little
the rooms were nice and having a comfortable bed with six pillows was a plus
the portions are ridiculous and really reminds me lot like plate lunches
our waitress although attentive at first disappeared after she took our orders
i heard rumors over a year ago that sin city smokers was planning on opening a restaurant in las vegas
i was in town for a convention at the lv convention center which being quite literally across the street was nice to not have to cab it all over town
however we recently stayed here for a staycation and we had the best vegas hotel experience out of every place we have been on the strip and that includes all of the 5star resorts such as venetianpalazzo wynn mandalaythehotel etc
we stayed in two connected one bedroom suites
i remember not liking it here because they gave us two free nights and they required us to put a down for incidentals
you must fill out a liability waiver before you start which you can print out and bring to the facility or use one of the kiosks when you get there
rooms are very clean
its not something you would expect to taste good but its seriously delicious
purple velour chairs purple velour headboard
the front entrance is not where the parking lot is
these ladies were so full of attitude i was literally taken back by them
i liked the fact that the restaurant tries to be different
no good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machines
other days are more near regular prices at such places including at super 8 access i was visiting unlv for a campus visit during the week of st paddys day 2017 i am starting a phd there in fall
the whole event had a cool storyline too if you follow it
as of this writing its 75 online with a 15 recommended for the driverguide at the end of the tour
fans bar counter and bathrooms all have fun design details
we also were given a handicap roomlord knows why also they really dont have any rooms with views
every time when we go to vegas  my fianc and i we wanna try new hotels to stay
large place lots of seating at booths or tables seat yourself clean dark and casual
dont be influenced too much by all the negative reviews
well to my dismay as soon as it was placed in front of me the foul smell coming from the dish told me that the clams were not fresh that being an understatement
i reallly really enjoyed staying here at treasure island
washing machine and dryer full service kichen with dishwasher to boot
good sized portions and the food was fresh and tasty
opening window in bathroom is nice to have
strong smoke flavor tender and moist perfect
since there were no locks sometimes it was hard to figure out if we unlocked a new clue or door because there were no signals to tell us usually
second we opted to pay the 10 fee day to rent a coffee maker but quickly realized it took at least 1 hour to get coffee in our rooms because the hotel staff delivered it very slowly
front desk associates at palms place are little to mavericklike in their personalities
the pool was just a short walk away and we swam both nights we were there
the breakfast was substandard as compared to other hotels in this chain as well
highly recommended to any locals but more importantly tourists who arent sure where to go how to get in what cover is
picked up 2 bottles of beer
no need to ketchup
you wont be disappointed
im usually in and out in under 5 minutes
i had the grilled calamari to start
not bad considering another place i stayed at was going to charge me for an extra night
the rooms look fantastic ive heard lots of good things about the mob bar and i enjoy the little downtown 3rd area thats popped up but beyond that eh
excellent breakfast and brunch
its not luxury its a decent but aging hotel
yummy smoked meats and sides to choose from
the food court is decent for fast food
after complaining they removed the charges
everything was very neat and clean and in working order
so why then would you want to spend  and stay there
loved the black out shades
complimentary water bottles at arrival in room
david and jorge the valets were awesome in helping us the whole week we were there
maybe parallel universes are real
the lunch was tasty but overpriced for being a casual restaurant in my opinion
if i were to visit vegas again i would definitely stay at lvh if there was another good deal like the one i got from livingsocial
overall though a terrible experience
amazing place for conferences or meetings
shrimp were a bit watery and soggy and crab legs reqd more work that was worth but heywe came in our elastic pants and left with no room to spareso it couldnt have been that bad
mix of 20 somethings all of the ways to families and older couples
the seating is friendly towards 4 people max inside
they had some video roulette machines and also had an organic roulette which has a real wheel that is spun by a machine
they do smell a bit musty
also started to call the place at 245 to tell them id be late and ask if theyd still take me
the hotel bar was very nice but had a very meager selection of whisky
a good deli
i got the short rib stew
its an awesome club if you like a lot of smoke machine smoke and beautiful girls dancing
we werent disappointed
i go to the front desk explain it to them and they ackowledged it was a mistake and offered me a 50 room credit for my inconvenience
i would consider staying here again however if you are single there are other hotels that are suppose to be more single friendly
this is not the case
a 16oz is 625 if i remember correctly
happy hour menu had a variety of choices that pleased our group namely the fried liver
everyone kept coming by to make sure that we were all set and if we needed anything
i later came back and sat in the lounge
had an excellent time
pay a few more dollars and stay somewhere else
i will also say that the hostesses on staff that day were so incredibly sweet
the center is empty except at the ground level where it makes up the ballroom and part of the dining room when necessary
the receptionist were cold but not rude
just seemed really flavorless and bland
very nice room comfortable bed and quiet
so there is no free wifi anywhere even if you are hotel guest as you have to pay 10
the cupcakes were a hit with the gals
we tried super hard to differentiate each of the three little homies but they were all so so so good so it didnt matter haha
then they want to text you for your reservation
looks like a regular hooter restaurant
the place needs a desperate new coat of paint on the outside
pure is a decent spot
we hated haze
pool was closed for maintenance with no heads up or warning from staff
the delano has the best inroom dining
they have so many different things for all sorts of people
not sure if thats a shared principle there
the room was a lot smaller than the ones  the wynn and the bathroom didnt have that wow factor
internet barely workedfrustrating when the front desk doesnt help you and you have to work
your move california come latelies
kerrie and i shared a matzo ball soup and fresh fruit
there are lots of cheap restaurants to choose from a place where you can buy cheap tickets for shows is downstairs walking distance to walgreens and the deuce and the checkin was quick and very friendly
five minutes and we were done
the upgrade was worth it
you get a 2x1 price for the unlimited rides at the top
he said whenever he works he could customize our pizza for us any way we wanted
every time ive gone to vegas i always make sure i hit up shaun
the tropical theme going on is exactly what i needed to fool myself that i was in an oasis
smart yet quirky and stylish
you cant beat it
et cette barre le wynn ne la fait mme pas trembler   cest un casino  peuttre fautil le rappeler tous les htels de vegas ne comportent pas de casino il ny a donc pas de fatalit  devoir traverser un hall enfum bruyant et clignotant pour accder  sa chambre
5 cookies for 3
the corned beef and tongue is amazing
yes the cashiers are mostly my peeps too
those are my favorites but i honestly have not had a bad meal from him
i have to add however this is also a catererso the emphasis on prepared to go food is understandable
ive stayed here about 4 times and i am sure that i will stay again
my boyfriend and i visited this place for the first time on memorial day and we will definitely be back
everything big t told me theyd do  they did and did it above and way beyond
the rooms have a large flat screen tv in the main room a small flat screen in the large bathroom and a regular tv in the  bedroom
cant say it was a super friendly conversation  all questions were met with go to our website and read the faq
restroom has ciel spa toiletries nice shower and sink
we revisited because my son had a family pass
so we stopped back agian an interestingly enough the only side open agian was the bar side
apparently howie mandel walked by a couple times
apparently the restaurant runs completely separate from the bowling alley
they charge like 125 for any sauce to dip even the 1st one yikes
we all spend with games and food up to 700  800
a great stay in lv
the chef was nice enough to take the french toast off the bill when i mentioned that its a tad burned on the outside
a well lit covered parking garage is attached and provided adequate and secure parking
it is called posole
the staff was nice and tried to moved me from one extremely horrific looking room into what was considered a remodeled room and even though it had painted walls it didnt have outlets the air was on and the room was freezing no way to turn it off because it required a remote which were missing
this was a friday night and it was packed
there was a great pool area indooroutdoor meaning that half the pool is indoor and the other half is outdoor
im really surprised this place is still in business
it tasted like a yummy pizza topping garlicky and tender
the big dad and im not talking about me consisted of bread texas toast and pork with no sauce
casino is very noisy and rooms are a long walk
hope this saves anyone from experiencing what i had to go through
even as it started getting busy my water glass was always full  they checked on me appropriately but not pushy
when the food came it was good but not great
the green sauce and red enchilada sauce both seemed like they were straight from the can  the cheap can  and really didnt have any solid flavor
lame and unnecessarily pompous
the elevator had a bit of a motion issue because it was going up at a slant which got me a little nauseous i do get motion sickness maybe its not a problem for most
its right across from the fashion show mall and close enough to everything  when i heard off the strip i was thinking it was off the strip
the hotel was formerly imperial palace
great location with the linq and harrahs on one side and the cromwell on the other
or go in and select the multitude of beef or pork
everything else aka
the room comes with starbucks coffee and tea as well
this place was awesome our first dinner in edinburgh
that all warmed you up for the final set of classic 60s dance tunes
the food the quality the presentation the taste
we then enjoyed the steam room jacuzzi and then pool
excellent food service and the sugared donuts are to die for
he was so right
is much more convenient and there is no lack of luxury in the wonderful jacuzzi suites
his food is amazing and very generous portions
the best thing about the place was probably the faux copper ceiling
also the teachers are very helpful and accomodating
good food and the service was great too
since we were exhausted and stranded we reluctantly took the keys to a different room which was thankfully empty and clean
long story short we complain to the manager who was nice enough but didnt really solve the issue at hand
we had a decent view of the vdara and cosmopolitans burned down pool area from last week
quite possibly the most uncomfortable bed ive ever slept on
each item has a censor and when you remove it it automatically charges your card
i slept for about 3 hours
without hesitation the bartender happily granted my request in a bar that was twice as crowded as hopcat
i came to vegas for a short trip and stayed at the mandarin oriental for one night
alles in allem waren wir nicht enttuscht  ehrliche bodenstndige gastronomie feine regionale kche keine unheilsamen kochexperimente ordentlicher und zuvorkommender service  note 2
finde die curries berdurchschnittlich gut dafr die tadoories eher unterdurchschnittlich
its a vegas casino there is really nothing special it has a movie theater some average casino food and an average vegas hotel
the complimentary hot breakfast is delicious and varied each day
we were told he was not there and his cell phone was turned off
after you get knocked out of the tournament they know they are going to have multiple players want to play cash however the list to play cash is usually 2030 people deep
he received cold appetizers so sent it back
the pool party makes it worth while this effect is negated in the novapril months
it is not on the strip but the view from the room show cased everything there is to see
the sweet tea wasnt very good
i came here after a recommendation from my hotel
try the jambalaya and the chicken breast from the gluten free menu
decent for business travel and conveniently located near several great restaurants and a whole foods
adam advised me that he would make a note for stuart to call me  first thing in the morning
the groupon said front row we asked to be sat in the front row  we were sat two rows back  even though there were no people in the front row yet  when that row was occupied it was because they were seated well after we were
first time ive seen them that they didnt return to do an encore and play community property and party all day
less than zero
boyfriend and i were moved here from the hotel we originally booked because they stupidly overbooked four points by sheraton tempe
my favourite lunch meal is their quiche and salad combo
the soft drink was almost all ice
ive been to the brickworks for a few reasons for walks around the wetlands totally amazing for the offleash dog park meh too muddy and for the farmers market my least favourite so many annoying people
they should tear down
we were staying for a wedding that was held up on the rooftop
centrally located  affordable rooms  earls sandwiches  lots of other good food options like lobster me and burgr  miracle mile shops  spice market buffet is just okay
i tell her another concierge told me to come down to pick up a charger
my boyfriend and his friend stayed here after going riding at ram jam sportsplex
im looking forward to future adventures with this awesome organization
we came here for brunch with my daughter and son in law
we both heard her on the phone passing room numbers around over the phone
great job and i will certainly return
i visited june 2012 and had a great time
not somewhere we would normally stay
luckily the reason that i was in cleveland has a deal with the hotel for 59 per night
this review is purely based on a trip to the brewery and the beer
i read a few reviews of this hotel that were both good and bad
it was supposed to be 30 or something
we went into our room and found hair on the bed and all over the sink
the one caveat is that its probably the cheapest place to stay in and youre not going to vegas to spend the majority of your time in the room
i would recommend the memory lane video team to everyone
the only things that was lacking were a fridge and a coffee maker
we paid 99 per night plus charged a 25 per night deposit
come on how can that be
the thread that ties together the great attractions restaurants hotel and public areas is the commendable job with the paris theme
on to the good a luxury hotel indeed
the only down side ive experienced is that he is busy
after looking over the menu i ordered the following for us to try bean  cheese burrito chicken pollo fundido beef fajita combo plate  a cheese quesadilla wa side of sour cream
now what does that tell you
they have beautiful chandeliers great artwork and they always have fresh flowers
i hung up and tried to get a hold of my fiance
i ordered 2 large arrangements for such a hard time for memy moms service
i prepaid for my hotel in expedia or else i would have checked out
this is a serious budget hotel
i recommend it for those who want a peek at their irish heritage
6  spotty wifi at 1230 am i was trying to get work done and wifi was not cooperating
now on to the concessions
handed us a ticket and disappeared
easy access to the freeway and shopping centers
the show was amazing thoughpeople hanging from the ceiling fire blowing from the walls there was even a lady with a chainsaw
visited for dinner on a sunday evening july 8 2012 sorry long overdue review
but i wont let that knock off a star because the rest of my experiences there have been wonderful
if you are worried about transportation they do have a shuttle that goes to a few other strip properties frequently stops at wild bills saloon first iirc or you can always just cab it wherever
it was a huge serving two pieces with a chipotle or other pepper sauce
we have been going to the chompies on shea for over two years and really enjoyed the hometown ny food and atmosphere
staff appears to be from the aria as theyre all in aria uniforms with a starbucks apron
jacquelyn kadonick was the event coordinator for our wedding at tahiti village on 031415 and it went perfectly with the exception of the sound system we used
service was extremely lackluster
finally after three hours it was time to go into the park
the staff and service were pleasant and i will definitely come back to this location to order again
the cashiers at the front immediately start pushing their race packages
we demolished it in a matter of minutes
if youre planning your first visit i recommend going early in the week to make sure you dont get annoyed and get used to the surroundings
bathroom sink was slow draining and funky sewer smell any time u flushed the toilet
ive been seeing fred as my hairstylist for 12 years and even though ive moved away from phoenix i still visit him whenever im back in town
we hung around the pool all afternoon then enjoyed treatments
we couldnt even book online it said we had to do live booking which we couldnt because they didnt pick up the phone update so one of the owners called and gave me and my sister a pass for free about an hour after i posted the review
of course there is also the endless drone of electronic slot machines whether real or manufactured and i guess nothing here is real but anyway that sound is everpresent everywhere in las vegas and if you cant stand that sound youll probably end up doing something inappropriate
made the experience even worse
i love the atmosphere food and wait staff are always friendly and attentive
if youre tanking at the tables in one place its easy to try another
upon check in there was a crowd in the lobby and everyone was trying to check in with no organization at all
the drinks out by the pool were ridiculous prices no outside food or drinks allowedeverywhere else in the hotel was much more reasonably priced they had us trapped yet again
didnt get to sleep at all
he only asks for the final score of the highest scoring team at the end
chips and salsa are great and they usually have some sort of drink special like 250 coronas all summer long
the service was fabulous our room the terrace suite  wrap around deck was amazing and the view was super incredible
never had a complaint staying here
great service nice store and they just made it very easy for me
anyway risotto was undercooked duck confee was under seasoned sticky pudding was not sweet enough
he offered me a different room on the same floor or another room on the 29th floor
all in all its worth the trip with the family
this place just isnt on their game
window seat was great to people watch
i was grateful that there was a mcdonalds next door to the hotel to eat a cheaper breakfast
though low end circus circus isnt as bad as other people make it seem
she knows everything about the city and really is such a great person and so nice
there is a reason why its cheapfirst of all the front desk worker was so rude when we were checking in
the bar is cool
i could also hear conversations going on in the hall
room as free internet via ethernet not wifi
we left around noon and were gone until 8pm  they had plenty of time to drop off new shampoo  make the bed
so then we booked a massage appointment and tried to move it when our plans changed
very noodle heavy and the noodles were almost mushy
parking all m life mgm property charges for self parking with the exception of 2 of their properties  circus circus and signature towers
be sure to try the stuffed peppers if you like a spicy kick in your appetizer
as far as the rooms they are pretty bland
upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite
for 30day it was cheap enough for my lean pockets
edit 9182012 id like to thank dave for the sincere apology ive received here on yelp two years and nearly three months after the fact
if were paying 580 for a room for 2 nights i expect that in back in customer service
this is a really beautiful hotel meets all expectations and the service is great too
id stay here again for the location and bar
just plan ahead and have a salad for dinner beforehand
i could not have disliked his place more
we habituated to the smell of the room on the 2nd day
it then proceeded to go down hill from then on once we got to the elevators to reach our room
normally we come down for edc in june and stay here but weve also stayed here for random spontaneous vegas vacations
from the staff to the food to the brews
this place is chandler best kept secretbut the word is out
the dj was awesome having to make up for me and my husbands tiny mistakes hehe and definitely kept everyone laughing and engaged  it was all so magical
even though hesthe owner of this business he is after all these years very humble and still caters to us directly during our trip
the staffs are friendly
pomegranate chicken mediterranean wrap 950  pomegranate chicken lettuce cucumbers tomatoes red onions red cabbage basmati rice feta cheese with your choice of sauce hummus or yogurt dill and tortilla flour wheat and spinachbasil
so much for express checkout
i was the best man so i was in charge of booking everything
when pulled shut it was black out
i stayed here for one night
the food  which was on  each level was very tasty
could use a little renovation
the scampicold yescold
i paid extra for a view and got a view of a gas station and fast food place
check out the pictures
now lets list some of the issues 1 it took 25 minutes to check in and i started at only number 3 in line
ive received several compliments and the best part is no need for mascara  which i dont own nor would i take the time to apply anyway
on a friday
she makes everyone comfortable and ensures that her shoots are fun
makes me feel like more than the number on my receipt
overall this was a 410very confusing 3 nights and was pissed i paid for this experience
at least that is what they said it was
our pilot kyle rounded up our group 6 travelers total
i highly recommend it
i did however try the loco moco that my boyfriend had and the gravy was reaaally good
daniel the owner of kids fun town organized everything perfectly and the whole party was easy and relaxing a first for a childrens party
fuck you criss angel
its such a shame to give this place a bad review
18 per day  boo hiss
this means you can hear parents shouting at their children using expletives that should make a longshoreman blush
they seated us then everyone ignored us until one of the bartenders said they all wanted to close and leave at 3 pm
the casino has that typical fun vegas feel and i enjoyed playing some video roulette
i would rather have little caesars than this place
the beds are very comfortable i always book a king or king deluxe suite which i am always happy with
the only thing i thought was even remotely intriguing was that the titanic exhibit was there although i had already seen it at great america so yeahhhhh
me and my friend wanted to have a spa day after a week of baseball and when we saw that spa lamar also had yoga classes we thought this is perfect
even the casino here at red rock is quieter cleaner and  while the strip isnt as seedy as the casinos downtown  the red rock doesnt feel like a casino
we worked together for over a year from two different states and went wonderfully
but if youre staying downtown or attending something at the us airways center this is a good option for an easy bite
he was so nice
the body wash doesnt lather and the lotion does not absorb into your skin
the jacuzzi was not working and had someone be in my room while we were trying to get ready
6 lovely ladies traveling to vegas for a 30th birthday party wanted to be close to the strip but not totally immersed in it
otherwise i would have given the hotel 4 stars
service was good but a lil updown for me
scotland is a place for all seasons all reasons
love this place everything about this hotel is as good as it gets as long as you are not expecting some kind of old timer style hotel
i mean how am i supposed to rest up for another wild night when im trying not to gag
if you are interested in an appetizer get the cheese crisp
i like the coffee its a nice light roast and its organic
i would give it zero stars if i could
on the breakfast sandwich i found the protein to carbs ratio pretty low
as appetizer the salmon size was bigger than i thought
job and your future is very unstable
good thing i was with good company who know how to skate and were teaching me the basics
we asked for them to be tossed in hot sauce but it was barely tossed properly and not spicy and all
but i am fed up with the nickel and diming
the whole experience was amazing
the next morning we decided to check out a day early after our room key didnt work again
they have square readers hallelujah
we called for service and were told somebody will come shortly
wifi and 65 tv and webcam access for my remote trainers
oft heralded as clevelands most iconic structure since its birth in the late 1920s the view was remarkable
there was a ton of pictures taken after the ceremony and the photographer let us pick who we wanted in the pictures
the pic of the dead cockroach is just priceless
we went directly from our wedding to a helicopter ride
youll definitely feel vegas if you stay here
i will start by saying that my group was staying in one of the renovated rooms so i cannot speak to the quality of the rooms that have not yet been renovated
also we were charged 14 to park overnight
alex was adorable and helpful and her store seemed to reflect who she is and you can tell she has a passion for this
not impressed i went here for breakfastbrunchi was truly disappointed
mix of edm and hip hop
the other positive is that on a saturday night they were not charging a cover for guys
too little selections
the first two times we went it was incredible and definitely one of our favorites in town
the guy sitting next to me ordered a pizza which looked horrendous
if you look online you can even find a 5 off coupon  httpwwwvegas4localscomcouponsdiningandnightlifebonniespringsranch i cannot stress first impressions enough though
they serve large helpings of food in all their dishes
i will certainly be back on a regular basis
service is usually great
the fatfeel of the first was overpowering
my family and i we just sat down for an excellent meal my wife had macaroni and cheese my son had a grilled chicken wrap and i had a veggie burger with tomato basil soup
the room was very nice and beds were super comfortable
everything was spotless
needs a renovation yesterdayjon taffer
yes they allow dogs but the pet exercise area is very far away and one parking space with astroturf does not an exercise area make
i was also surprised how small and slow the gaming area was
the hotel was a little hard to find
cannot believe it
but its still a fun place with a good location
i got stung by a bee in the armpit as i was sunbathing on the pool float bed
12  our bedroom did not look anything like the yelp pictures that were posted
the girls we brought were thrilled by the experience
we quickly found out our room did not have hot running water
i called the front desk from my mobile
some of the towels were a bit sketchy and i didnt like the fact that almost all of the smaller towels were accordianfolded into fans i dont want someones hands running all over all my towels
i will not be gambling at any mgm resort hotels while im here and will not stay in any of these hotels when i come back at the end of the year
im not really a fan of the chicken taco salad
this was my first cirque du soleil show and i was completely blown away
i love this place
best 12 ever spent
i must preference my rating by saying it would have been better except for an unfortunate happening see below for further details
where do i even begin
we were told they would be ready shortly so went to eat
it was very firm and fortunately for us not a pillow top
banana cream and caramel brule
der pool und das layout an sich wrden von mir glatte 5 sterne bekommen aber aufgrund der teuren drinks und des akuten platzmangels gibt s nur 3 der bamboo pool im cosmopolitan gefllt mir deutlich besser
the rooms were ok beds small but comfy
theres a giant fake tree in the middle of the hotel next to an area with a oxygen bar and a water massaging machine
but this place in montreal is pretty jawtothefloor gorgeous
i dont know what they put on it but its greatand addictive
well we were told no outside food or drink oh that means not outside the casinogee that explanation wouldve been helpful
i have seen fosse sunset boulevard my fair lady and jersey boys in the main stagethis is surely one of the most spacious comfortable and welcoming venues in the country
they were booked last night or we would have stayed there
personally ill never never never stay here again
its a great resource for anyone planning to attend or to keep in touch with other club members
im not one of those people i wish to be with my own snazzy shoes and ball insert christmas list here
really i intended to stay there on my free nights and just walk to aria to do my gambling but the frequent drinks kept my ass in their seats
only half a roll of toilet paper and they dont even supply extra roll so at night we went to a funeral viewing
service was great food was also delicious
from front the desk to the bartender
one more note is that i much prefer big apartment style rooms as i now travel with my small family and like to have a kitchen washerdryer full fridge etc
big improvement from the first time i came in and eat with my friend
i was disappointed
the room looked very spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous and huge
thank you roxanne and ed
the antipasta salad so delicous
we also went to the jeanphilippe bakery and had the best chocolate croissants ever
when i tried to call back she refused to answer the phone
ice cream alcohol boxing soda sliders foozeball ping pong the list goes on and on
the kallista sinks were beautiful and the separate water closet was a nice touch the televisions thoughdidnt work all the time and seemed frozen for lack of a better word
they wanted 150 per utensil
i think the staff is trained to smile and say to everyone
hello housekeeping id like 3 pillows please i prefer no down pillows as hubbie is allergic
no free wifi
needless to say i got up and left without the meal ive been hoping for for so long
review for cafe kokopellithe haciendas coffee shop i have been to this restaurant about 5 times or sosometimes when returning from arizona or boulder dam or sometimes after going through boulder cityone of my favorite places
booked this 3 months in advance for a birthday weekend for my fianc
on day 2we placed the room service request sign as we left only to walk into the same condition we left it ini guess houseskeeping skipped our room
if you too are a freak about an allinclusive indulgence  this was it
on the wedding day we were surprised that the minister who appeared was a woman and not the man we had been emailing with for four months
the coffee maker ironing board and toasters in both room were broken
so good so we had to go back
located in a commercial business strip but well worth the stop
might have been a little too close as we had direct views into the ladies hoohas
it wasnt very busy and kind of dead
i have to admit we didnt stay in the room much
we were amazed at how kind and professional the mirage staff was with the incident
the room was perfect for our needs
its walking distance from the sky dome to even all the bars
it gets better though  the marble floors in the bathroom are heated
we ate here twice and i got sick both times
i finally had to get out of the car and find a bellman who was willing to help me out by taking the car himself
the hot chocolate was rich and dense the melted marshmallow was a nice touch
we would have loved to have payed for that
the bath was rather worn and the sink and tub had cracks in them
there is plenty of seating and its quiet enough to have a conversation
not superclean neither filthy
i am sure there are lots of people who will love and enjoy this place just remember your pepsid or tums
allinall i really do love this property
i particularly enjoy the beef tip risotto its creamy delicate and filling
but those ones usually dont last long
i handed him my signed statement and then asked if when i would be contacted
there is a 300 charge when you check out but thats the cheapest fee ive paid staying at a vegas hotel and the 100 deposit seems to be standard compared to most
from the vallet  front desk gardeners and breakfast at the swb
dj chimz
hot chocolate cake for dessert was good
kim was our server and she was very attentive and made sure everything was great
on a very positive note the bed was exceptionally good
the staff is very nice
we took my mom here and she loved it
the hilton garden inn used to be the wyndham and the new wyndham used to be the holiday inn
there were a ton of flavors and everything looked really delicious
in retrospect i guess it actually was corny and we did have a funny story to tell afterward but it was totally enjoyable and 100 worth the price
after moving rooms connecting door doesnt open
theres also no wifi anywhere
quality is not that great at all
it was a lot of people dressed up and ready to have a great time
we went to three deferent clubs drais light and 1oak
he was very professional and polite even asking if there was anything i wanted to focus on
if youre looking for a yummy meal on the nicer dinning side of champaign v picasso is a great place
it is a true cleveland treasure that will make you immediately want to create something
can see lecage aux sports from third floor and guests ready to leave
above that is their huge sandwich board
not a whole lot of snow there at the resort yet
service here has been mixed 85 of the time waiters have been quick polite and right on
he also said that connecting your phone to the panel doesnt do anything but charge it and you have to use an auxiliary cable which they normally provide but are completely out of
this is the most horrible customer experience i had ever have in any hotel
maybe it was her unkept hair or the skirt she had on that was way to bigor that she dragged her feet when she walked as if to say i seriously do not want to be here right now
i have lived down the street from this place for eleven years but never went in until yesterday
this is another off shoot the collaboration between saks and the pusateri fine foods
i  enjoyed the decor and the service was very good
i highly recommend taking this tour
it was a memorable night out with a friend visiting from ny
my favourite dessert was this amazing tart raspberry mousse unfortunately served in teensy shot glasses basically a teaspoonful
omgthis is one of those experiences that isnt supposed to make sense
they have daily specials that are great pricing and have always had friendly service
not bad dessert
die vorfhrungen finden montag bis freitag von 15002000 uhr alle halbe stunde und von 20002400 uhr alle viertelstunde statt
i love the restaurants here so far and payout on the machines are pretty good
their cheddar soup is so good
it is not for the light of heart and probably not for one person alone
we are in las vegas for the weekend and decided to visit memphis championship barbecue
if you go to vegas call ricky
greek fries appetizer
other things i liked about the hotels are the location of course its right on the strip not far from the big hotels you probably wanna hang out at
first the wifi wasnt working so i had to go to my friends room in phoenix too use his second i had a bellman banging on my door and when i answered he stated oops wrong door and finally the one that broke the camels back
all staff were friendly helpful  professional
they dont allow you to take a bell cart out of the hotel to retrieve your luggage so you have to carry everything
great place to catch a unique flick while enjoying a frosty beverage
the staff on duty is great as well
my room a suite was lovely with a great view of the pool the shower was hot with marvellous pressure towels and linen were excellent furniture was comfortable and decor tasteful
the elevators are divided by room number tower for the suites and then the rest are divided by floor
their primary concern was getting me off the property which included over 30 of my guests
not only that but she also had a special dr seuss chair made for us as well as a knit cat in the hat outfit just for us because she knew our nursery was themed in it
then there is the obligatory gift shopfor kids
everyone else seemed to like their food a lot
avoid this crap hole i know i will
the food was amazing
the worst and unprofessional company
many pictures taken which ill upload eventually
a couple days before we were going to go because hard rock was having a concert we were attending and we wanted to make sure we got a table
i promise you will not be sorry
there was 1 waiter and a restaurant manager that was so rude and clearly didnt know what was going on
glass colored windows really did not match with the brown tiles it looked like the decor inside had been done with whatever they could find on sale
they had gf bread nothing fancy probably just frozen udis and they brought me two slices microwaved to defrost and then i was able to toast them to eat with honey
first off we were excited to use the refrigerator to store food and save money for the first few days of our trip but our room had a broken refrigerator
if you are going to do that make sure other customers cannot see you
my suggestion this place needs a whole new revamp in management and admin staff
they also gave me a free ak mag so that was included in my deal
housekeeping please use a vacuum
so ive worked in the service industry for 10years and have always hated this sitebut here i amyelpingand i hate that i am going to do this but the service was terriblewaited at the host stand for almost 5 minutes before being greeted  sat for our resono water or greeting happened for almost 10 mins after being satthen was greeted by the manager
like 530pm early grab a reservation on opentable and enjoy the great service
overall this was a fabulous place for our vacation and i was very pleasantly surprised
ill only tip after i receive the service not a ransom to get service
the staff are friendly and knowledgeable and are willing to suffer any wide eyed teen who walks in and asks hey man i want to sound like that guy from slipknot
i was surprised at the location  they tore down the old ramada which was something of a champaign landmark for many years
it was raining heavily outside
our tiny window  looks into it
rooms are quite large
it was the cherry on top if you know what i mean
foie de canard excellent
if not i suggest you skip it
i will go through las vegas suites for our future stays
they smelled like they were stored in an old ancient basement
obviously we didnt get it as we both sit there waiting for her to deal when we havent got any bets out
im getting incredibly frustrated and upset
somebody clean the hallways for heavens sake
the shades could be automatically set
service was inattentive and i felt that not being a regular actually hurt our chances of having a decent meal
they were dense and not as amazing fluffy as reviewers say
you may not wow your friends but this is a quality place at a fair price in a perfect location
i swear by them for the majority of their customer service
my daughter has been freaking out seeing her mom sick
pull it together chickfila pull it together
amazing customer service
the rooms are very large with lots of seating as well as a massive bathroom
i also agree with the previous review that the balcony was not worth the added cost
so far im not exactly impressed
1 the mixed reviews about the room and the unsavory looking bathtub in the room
the entire menu is delicious
well continue to go but hope they consider our feedback
loved our wraparound corner suite
the floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor
highly highly recommended
this hotel has hidden fees all over the place
stayed here 1 time and that is it
i accepted their invitation and was amazed at the level of service i received during my return visit
definitely stop in for some great tacos
the beds are the best ive slept on in a hotel
no apology or attempt to fix the broken internet
portions are quite large and the prices are fair
to sum up my experience here the room was nice and the bed really comfortable the pool was nice but not as nice as mandalay or even mgm and the service was disappointing i mean im sure hotel room card readers malfunction or die from time to time but there should have been more of an effort on the hotels part to either minimize the inconvenience or even at the very least try to make it up to me i never got that free upgrade nor did i even get a sincere apology
on my first visit i decided to take advantage of the  take out service  rather then eating at the restruant
staff was courteous friendly and made amends for the bad nights sleep
i was with one other girl so it wasnt so awkward
i am personally a huge fan of caphirinas and this one did not disappoint
i asked her about it and she instantly became very rude as if i was in the wrong
i stayed here for a recent business trip and i was pleasantly surprised
i went to a pool party on july 1st 2017 it was advertised as a 21 and up event it was not
55 our server forced us to take our leftover dessert home
well previously yelpers  mentioned the slots here being tight i tend to agree with them as well
our stay here was amazing ive never had such good service
ive gone a couple times and the place has always been nearly empty
they were light very crisp and not too greasy
i added chicken and requested dressing on the side
the internet is another issue
the place is outdated musty and in need of a facelift
authentic mexican sit down food10x better than a garcias or a macayos
bewaredrinks are 21 and up
check out my review
the hotel is pretty big the rooms are small but comfy
use of the fitness area costs 15 and internet costs 13day which seemed rather pricey to me
the lobby is small and layout of the hotel is confusing
this is the result of over exercising the muscles early arthritis and of course in todays worldstress
you enter online to win some sort of nascar package deal but everyone who enters gets a free nights stay as a consolation prize
the special was a soda and 2 slices of pizza for 599
we arrived at 1am on a monday and realized we didnt pack toothpaste
if not for the signature suites towers feels as though this hotel would not get the guest nor the revenues it has received as of late
now thats customer service
they have a small cafe downstairs near the lobby but it closes early
we sat on the lounge side where they offer a happy hour and we got a sushi roll and a cheese and chorizo french fry appetizer
sure youre 14 decent but the best things about you were the pool the la salsa restaurant and nathans hot dogs in the food court
now thankfully i am not shy but id rather be focusing on something else
holy crap this place is a pit
the one downside was the lighting in the room its very dim so if you want good lighting to do your make up use the bathroom or open the blinds
their food is wonderful and everything tastes scratch made and authentic
mother of one of the brides
the family style meal is also really fun for a big group
it was equipped with granite counter tops stove fridgefreezer microwave dishwasher cooking and eating utensils coffee maker blender toaster washerdryer  which all proved to be quite useful during our stay
i was there for the first time a couple nights ago to see one of my favorite bands
now of course its all digitized
electrical outlets were loose
how can one places raw shellfish be any better than anothers
we went to the new guidos late on a saturday afternoon
cant beat the price of 699 per person
it was such a luxury
up front and close to the stageperfect sized room not a showroomhigh pitched voices are very similar to original guysover 40 crowd for sure however flashback to the saturday night fever show for sure
2  no kid friendly activities or food to eat hereand i mean nothing
at the end of the show you get a chance to take a picture with some of the kings and their horses which was awesome
the servers are all super friendly gorgeous and always seem to know when you need another mojito or two
tickets start at 75 per person but if you get the coupon book they have 2 for one deal and maybe get 2 tickets for 100
so i tried to book tickets for evita on line and i thought the whole procedure was too cumbersome
check in was a breeze and friendly service
wir haben das hotel fr unglaubliche 25  pro nacht gebucht
i had to ask for a cotton swab for the blood
the staff is very nice
and seriously the views cant be beat
so friendly and helpful i guess youre paying for it but thats why you go here
we drove up that morning and went to mirabel for 6pm
i had a 12 hot pastrami on rye w fries and a small bowl of chicken noodle soup
kaddie the vip host jon and princeton from security are what keep me coming back
ate one on the spot and took the other back to the room
half of the wrap was plenty of food for me
the disrespect turned to discrimination and cruelty
there was about a handful  a half of fries which after eating the hamburger  sampling all the appetizers i couldnt finish the fries
we are considering buying honey bears sauce and getting bobby qs beef ribs to go without the sauce
my mom loves their wedding soup
located on the 4th floor of the cosmopolitan and thus laden with the hotels typical douchebag crowd of bros wearing sunglasses at 8pm it was much to my dismay that i found myself standing around waiting for interpol to begin at 945 on a thursday evening the stage set far above people who seemed as though the cared far less about the music about to begin than taking selfies and smoking pot while admiring one anothers skinartthough in the end perhaps this was appropriate given the pisspoor quality mixing and glare from aria as well as ph as sounds from the strip echoed into the night air
two key points  1 lunch cheaper laidback 2 french fries with garlic aioli fatty deliciousness you must ask for the aioli
not here theyre perfectly cooked  and chewy  so go corn all the way
wolfgang pucks restaurant stays open 247 such a lifesaver at 4am and it was literally down the elevator from our hotel room
very clean and simple the only thing that was missing was an ipod hook up i like to play my music when i get ready
get the special go to the time share meeting then leave
im from honolulu where we dont have anything remotely this cool in a pga fanboy meets vegas bottle service kind of way
the staff rudely said no because they said it was already 830pm and that their reservation was only until 830pm
both totally casual clothes and dress clothes feel appropriate here
was a bit crazy with all the kids but was great fun
we had to air out the room the chair has a bunch of unidentifiable stains the shower squeals when you run it the sink doesnt drain properly the free wifi is incredibly unreliable and slow but all this adds up to a systemic problem of crappy hotel
bonus  i checked in on foursquare  they were offering 25 off the entire bill and they honored it
super nice staff and the ribs are awesome
we explained our situation again to the cashier lady and she laughed in his face and said that we must be joking
these people are at the bottom of the food chain
and a smile never hurt anyone either
but while she was with them 3 other employees were filling balloons for an order
the tuna is amazing
we went down to the front desk this morning and discussed it with the gentleman on duty
on goes the hunt for swim lessons
hint fellas go and youll find some nice looking chicks in there and very little competition
that afternoon she called and addressed the noise issue with the front desk
the food was just okay although presentation for the good was great
definitely could have been better
as a wedding planning in scottsdale we work with many different wedding officiants
all in all i got the balloons i wanted at a decent price and i got them on a holiday
she placed us on a higher level floor which was nice
everything was ono
huge rooms fridge microwave and a twoperson jetted tub
i stood around for a good five minutes until i started looking for someone to help
we are were bellagio regulars and noticed some cheap cutbacks on this most recent visit
i am looking forward to bringing my daughter back more often especially when my second child is born
the place is amazing the spa is one of the best in arizona
so until the next few days when the hotel decides to refund the money there is a hold of 1500 on our cards
this is one of those hotels where the moment you walk in you know youre in for a great experience
if you area a true sports bettor then the lvh is the place for you
i had to call another number to get the 99 dollar rate
anyway other staff r nice  n the crowd is good
honestly for a hk style restaurant if you cant make the milktea right chances are you wont survive for very long
it is difficult to believe a restaurant would serve a customer inedible meat
i have never stayed here so i cant comment on the rooms
we just all really wanted to see santana
housekeeping did a great job
i like how they offered slippers in the room
sergio was prompt very courteous professional and he did a fantastic job for all of us
just up the street is the wholesale district that has many great places to eat
i have to say this was a warning sign
so if you are thinking about staying here with your kids on a weekend i would cancel it and stay in another hotel
i booked rooms for our company again at the renaissance las vegas for next october
came here on a triple date with friends on a saturday night
to treat any guest but especially a diamond player is insane
for me this is the first and last
the decor and the vibe are fun theres so much to look at wherever you sitting
hopefully they will send me shopping again
very friendly welcoming and accommodating
we still have wedding guests raving about the food at our wedding
a little on the ghetto side but it was cool
the hotel is beautiful unexpense the only thing i suggest to the manager is clean the carpet of the room we stayed in room  309  and the carpet was with dirty spots but the rest was fine
hence the 4 star rating i am giving
not sure what the smell is its sweet and isnt an overpowering flower smell
i can make it
sommelier was very helpful knowledgeable and just good peeps
the food was surprisingly good
oh and lets not forget the high quality amenities like the moulton brown soaps and shampoos
go out for dinner drinks and walk home
they have gotten me last minute hard to score reservations on few occasions and they will never have you waiting for a taxi
so ive now spent literally hours waiting on hold with mgms billing department trying to get them to send me my folio since the website says it will take 710 days to go through their automated system
it wasnt until i went to pick it up that my experience with them changed
first the bad aspects
take your business elsewhere where they treat their customers with respect and respect the environment
i didnt like that plan as everyone knows how long it can take just to get just a halfmile down the strip
ive stayed at many aloft hotels and this one is excellent
we cant wait to use lil leto again soon for all of our catering needs
we had to track down our booking updates at the hilton
worse our room had a loose shower handle which would droop lower causing the water to get progressively hotter
the pool area had a water slide and we even reserved a cabana by the pool one day and loved the service
everytime you get in a cab
however as soon as i got there it clicked and her explanation was really spot on sorry aunt t i thought you were crazy for a sec
the toilet area had a door for privacy
i was not impressed
the bed is made out of downso it was a little pokynot my preference at all but it was a nice get away just to get away
i went there for a salsa night
during this call he refused to even look at their security video
magic courtesy of the big time las vegas casino and resort venetian is truly worth your time
i personally bought a deck of cards and a metal bill of rights they will explain it in their act
best tacos i have ever had
also when my son checked out they tried to charge him twice as much as the quoted price for one of the nights
i know i always love the wonkiness of dbirds routes a shower and bathrooms good snackdrink selection safety focused gym with requirements and tests for being able to do things like lead the whole gym is leadable ncc only has lead climbing in the cave and the refuge is all bouldering 4 auto belays kids climbing classes and times  contribute to climbing community with annual bouldering comps you can rent gear to take outside
the only thing that upset me was the fee that i had to pay to hotel  after check out for holding on to my bag till i returned from sight seeing
we arrived a little after 2p and the patio was full due to the aforementioned great weather
a great artsy feel that is like wandering into the of a artist on extacy
our server grant was especially friendly and accommodating
tourist trap in my opinion
ok  i always thought pizza was about the same everywhere
until next year
72 a night on hotwire 16254 total with tax for a friday and saturday night
we reserved a suite and they offered us a 1 bdrm deluxe suite for 40 more a night and it was the best thing we could have ever done
this place is amazing
for those of you that frequent dutch bros down the street true brew is worth getting out of the car for
the newly renod mode rooms are decked out with flat screen tvs mini philosophy bath products and ipod dock alarm clocks
overall it felt like some corners had been cut at the hotel andor it is just aging and the proper care hasnt been put in to making sure the details are taken care of
the bathrooms were clean with two sinks but the clear showers and translucent glass between the bathrooms and toilet was a bit weird
my personal favorites are the full montagu and the earls club
the hotel has the atmosphere of a train station and the clientele is cheap
not very appetizing plus i felt bad for the next group having to wait until the table got cleaned
even after the chaos our host made sure everyone got home okay
ive had it here twice before but it was a summer style preparation with a tomatoarugula salad
we came down around 930 and every seat was taken including a group of 40 in the back
they dump sunflower seed in kitchen drawers and trash behind bathroom door
really loved the tomato soup at the beginning and also enjoyed eating with my hands
i just browsed since i had already completely my shopping but wanted to get an idea of what they had
there is also a nice outdoor patio for the restaurant
overall experience  my overall experience was good and based on the location front desk staff and the room i would likely stay here again
i went out to eat pretty much every meal so i never got a chance to test this service
my girlfriend went to see who it was
you know some of the reviews on here made me absolutely terrified of what i might find when we checked into our hotel room at the quad but when we got there i was pleasantly surprised
i would suggest eating off property if you are looking for a good steak dinner
wait staff were kind shop staff were kindstaff make the strip experience and nyny knew how to make us feel welcome
the response so far has been very underwhelming and we are beyond upset
the las vegas strip tix4tonight outside ballys sold us upper level tix for half price
if you are lucky you just might get to meet tc while you are here
restaurant selection is decent but for the stature of the property should have more
i dont know what the band meant but when we tried to order drinks at the first bar the bartender pointed at my wristband and said that i should order at the second level bar
this place is tacky and incredibly unprofessional
were so grateful to angela and everyone that made our special day exceptional
cons valet was always full
good quality and quantity for the price
just have to say best place i have stayed in vegas
i still havent received my deposits back so well see how that goes
everything about this place is spectacular but that it is tucked into the butte in a resort like setting with waterfalls in a waterslide is just fabulous
the important thing is the magic
i am not sure if i will frequent the flamingo or even go back unless there was something enticing
airport taxi is 8 and various companies operate that pick up at multiple hotels so give yourself time to get to the airport
im no princess and i booked a room took one look at it and just left the keys on the bed and went somewhere else
before digging in i saw there were 2 different sauces available on the table
this is the only hotel ive ever stayed in that will not under any circumstances allow you to charge your phone in any part of the hotel
they have everything you need but set up was a little quirky
our grandchildren enjoyed hours of playtime in the pool
i guess that is where i will make the effort to sit from now on
i was not impressed witht that
when it was finally time to sit down at the computer to pick the pictures i wanted to purchase i immediately said to delete all the pictures i told her i didnt want to do
horrible experience for my 30th birthday
personality of  rock manager printed out another receipt and gave it to new girl who told me she added the charge back on my card
we also enjoyed a pre bingo drink at the round middle bar in the casino
not enough to knock off a star the water pressure in the shower sucks
3 blackjack helps pass time as well
the staff from the parking attendants to the bartenders and the front desk crew are all extremely helpful and provide service with a smile
i highly recommend their burrata
he came up to us with no any greetings and his first words were explaining what the soup of day was
the bartender was knowledgable  funny
and the restaurant is beautiful
one of the worst hotel ever
after a nice chat and some parlaying with the gm he offered a complimentary late checkout and the privilege of keeping my room keys as a souvenir
the ugly boo to this woman named luisa
was yummy
you get a rectangular community center pool
transient population  but that is to be expected from a place that rents weektoweek
i have never had allergies but thought it was due to the change in climate
the room is beautiful with a spanish mission influence
beware of this florist
so i was beyond glad i had requested early check in
we fought at check in to get that ridiculous resort fee removed but with no luck seriously ridiculous though making a guest pay for something they werent going to be using
had a 30 minute drive all the was down south but it was definitely worth it though
both my room keys failed took security 20 minutes to come up and open my door
im hoping the food improves because we wanted to like this place but after this experience im not so sure well be back anytime soon
well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out
i did see a tiny speck of mildew in the corner of the shower but it was not a big deal
we didnt get it here
it was just a lot of little things that could of been prevented if maintenance wouldve taken care of it
my mother was specifically told shed be placed in the north tower because the convention was being held in that area
the bathroom was excellent with a large shower and great lighting
the shuttle was the most helpful thing they literally drove us all over town and were super helpful
it is soooooooooooo worth it
this hotel is fantastic
the resort itself is in the best spot on the strip i mean you name it cosmo checks all of the boxes
the aria room had a bunch of issues
the rooms are definitely big enough for two people with 7 nice size luggages
my bridesmaid called and they immediately gave me an apt for the next day
the groupon was a good value since it covered admittance for 2 adults our kid included lots of tokens for games and 2 free drinks
however they have raised the price of all of the games
which says a lot bc one wrong turn in cleveland and you could be in deep trouble
i asked to be seated elsewhere but the hostesses excuse was that this was all that was available due to reservations
staff here are really friendly and go out of their way to make this a nice family environment
i burned through 4 gb of data before i decided to run a data test
i stayed here with my wife and two kids for one night before flying out
ok so ive been bugging the crap out of  my man package to go with me to the new hotel
this is the third and final attempt to close you
they have several of the very popular clubs on property
nothing is ever going to be perfect but this night really came close
thank you verna and exotic florist for making our special day perfect
so one would think that they would be prepared with the proper waitstaff to handle this size of a party
the showers are small and somewhat dirty
it certainly isnt an easy thing to tell someone you have a disability and so i was kind of humiliated and upset
i ordered a kids meal since i had weight loss surgery and they refused to serve me
i would definitely do it again any time
it ruins your  vacation when your hoping not to run into giant bugs at every turn in your own room or that you might wake up with one that climb in bed with you
the fountains were great the buffet was great security was great house keeping was great i have no complaints
no1dp also experience cellular data problems at his end
even though we did not stay in the room that is facing directly at the fountain we were still able to see a portion of the fountain
of course living in charlotte that could be a problem
if you go to the day club make sure to order a surfside  it has some delicious tropical flavours that will keep you coming back for more
there was so much fun stuff to do all within walking distance
but all the good is ruined by the horrible customer service here
music is always good and its a good place to grab a  drink and a snack as long as you are in the mood for fried carbohydrates
note i do not suggest actual crack lets keep it pg  safe over here friends
when it came time to pay my friend and her mom had coupons for free entrees and an appetizer however the waiter refused to accept them claiming you had to enter the coupon code when you registered online for the class
beautiful hotel love the tone and feel
the room was clean and the staff was polite
meat ya there friends
meaning if you want the fan to run you have to adjust it every 10 minutes when the system flips from on to auto on its own
yesterday i got complimented on my glasses  how cute my dog milo is
i also liked how despite it being near closing time at 8pm no one tried to usher us out of the pool we were already walking around near the entrance anyway and didnt kick us out when we just sat on the couch in entrance lounge just a bit longer
even valet parking was full
we also ordered a chicken burrito that could have been pork but it was way too pink to be fully cooked whichever animal it came from
and they dont have pagers so you have to wait by the front door or you cant hear the girl with the tiny voice call your name
decent price and good staffs
once the cleaning crew camein all of the particles was on the carpet which was vacuumed but not very well even twodays later some particles were still there showing that they didnt vacuum over the next several day
or would tell me something then say i think making me feel they didnt really know
again  such a great and comfortable spot to paint and enjoy yourself
they have the marriage process boiled down to a concentrated couple of hours
next year i suggest boston market go ahead and close for xmasi wont  be back as a result of this experience but why risk other customers
the taco shells were so stale they were disgusting the meat had no seasoningdressing
so it was fun that they try to make each one different and harder than the last
the bedspread is 2 sheets enveloping a dirty old thin blanket
anything more is a bonus
just dont gamble here
not to mention all at a very reasonable price tag
lots of options
i wont be going back either as a guest or a gambler
it was exactly what i wanted but better
we started with the calamari which i dont love so nothing held against oi on that one although the fried zucchs were a nice addition and then i had the chopped chicken salad
lighting stage props and music sound and selection are every bit as good if not better than at other strip properties
not bad at all i was here for the first time iwth few other friends
like im standing at the bar staring at you for my health
this barrestauranthotel is in a great location just off the west end of princes street
will call later this was what i expect from very low end hotels
the blue man group at luxor is advertised for a few bucks more in the tv ad but upon requesting it at the box office its not part of the package until after new years
poor ventilation in the casino area great food at the buffet confusing parking structure long line for checkingin
thank you so very much again for capturing our special day
ignoring me throwing food making a joke with another employee that my food was gross and smelled
i found an excellent rate online about three weeks ahead of time and as a whole i am pleased with what i experienced
either way good if you need a space
we received a room for two queen sized bedsbut they did offer an upgrade for 60 for a king size
one thing to make note of is that this particular neighborhood is not the most glamourous  youll see alot of drug dealing and prostitution from here to the budget suites a couple of blocks down the road
their prices are totally reasonable and their pick updrop off services are outstanding
the suite simply wasnt worth it and i had nicer comp rooms already at hotels on the strip
the venetian used to be my favorite hotel  bar none  in las vegas
we ordered a caesar salads and an small round square pizza dont remember the name of it
then again i was drinking  i had the fish  chips
totally forgot that theyre part of ihg now so it seemed like i may have been assigned a better room with a strip view given my status
this was by far the worst
i am only taking one star off because while i find the staff knowledgeable i find them a bit brusque on the phone but not in person
problem being still had little kids there and the interaction between the kids and drunks are probably not the best thing
the kitchen wasnt very modern but definitely not outdated
you were wasting my time making excuses instead of being proactive and helpful
the atmosphere was very casual and tvs at the bar make it a great spot for happy hour or sports watching
no complaints there
luckily rooms were available
the food was quite tasty and the service was really good given our big party
everytime im in vegas from here on out i will definitely be stopping by tcs
it reminds me of the equally mediocre cosi chain in new york where they serve up sandwiches between flattened toasted buns overdoused with dressing
my favorite is the salmon
i didnt need to get to the south elevator tower to get to my room and the east tower to get to my friends rooms
you wont believe how great the new pool area is
my family booked a room at the mandalay bay resort through expedia for 108night
oh and lets not forget that pool
this place can have all my money
we went for lunch on saturday afternoon and sat at the chefs counter
i seriously have nothing bad to say about this hotel casino
the cold was a mix of italian cold cuts  procuitto olives eggplant salad salmon on mozerrela bread etc
the bed was comfortable and thats about the only positive
it was also much farther than the strip and everything else
it was salty
last time about four years ago  i came through the entrance closest to regal theaters  the food court
service is adequate but there is room for improvement
the smoked salmon starter tasted amazing with the caviar and the potato blinis complemented the dish nicely
but with better food
her work is timeless and original
havent been to bare yet so cant comment on that
i recently stayed here for 8 long days
the lights the curtains and the privacy light are all controlled from a little panel near the bed and all operate at the touch of a  button
they requested hawaiian and after some research island flavor was the chosen spot
first time using this property
stains splattered on the curtains in the hotel room see picture and the balcony facing the freeway and parking lot was tiny without enough room to sit
i wish bathrooms came with little air vents to suck up all the crud vapor that we humans create if all else fails light a match
the hotel didnt disappoint however wasnt quite a five star experience
i wouldve given four stars for the room alone
simply one of the best dinning experiences ive had this year
having elana as our photographer was one of the best decision we made when it came to planning this wedding
not a good start but the glass of wine helps dull the senses the entree  we went for the steaks and fillet mignon
thanks for the relatively comfy stay hotel tempephoenix
both of these bobby q sauces were great but since im a huge fan of spicy i preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one
we had two double beds and it is apparently against the fire code to put a rollaway in a room with two beds so we were politely denied the request
i didnt stay here one of my colleagues did
avoid this place
unfortunately the stairs were dry walled off between the first and second floors making using the stairs impossible
not only that the cosmo then refunded my closed credit card for the 1 nights deposit which caused me alot of stress trying to call my old credit card company to get a check issued to me several days after the refund should have taken place
surprised they didnt go for a moodier less brightly lit design like mirage
i just have to wait for them to have the right picture because im really picky about what im going to paint
this is me n mumz second time here for thanksgiving and they always make us feel like weve come home to family for the holidays
perhaps i would let that slide if the customer service was acceptable it wasnt
the one is topped with a wonderful mixture of spices and is incredible i could have made a meal of just that bread
i mean its all spectacular but the pork really stood out
carnitas is on the menu but only in their tacos
all in all the meat was a little bland and dry  for the price we expected better
i command you to order a bundt cake here for your next party
interacting with v transportation was a miserable experience for everyone
on saturday night it was very much understaffed
i can get better wings at a lower price from the local pizza places
i tried the oreo and chocolate cupcakes and they were both delicious
he does rather well at engaging the audience
the manager was not outrightly rude to me but her demeanor showed it
heck with the mall next to ti you basically do not have to leave the hotel
mirrors were dirty bad job or no job of cleaning them
my boyfriend and i stayed for a couple of nights last week and loved it
with all of the theme hotels in vegas it is refreshing to see a new resort that focuses more on real quality and luxury than gaudy plastic representations of the same
stayed here last week for a work conference
that being said their hotel rooms are no better than a motel 6  the beds had no springs as if it was used by every hooker in vegas
the mountain views in both directions are awesome
but definitely noticed the smoke it more than at the other casinos we visited
i had heard nothing but good things about this place and the reviews were positive
i wonder if a customer service seminar for these people should be in place
i think the room was  75 which is a great price all things considered
emailed them in the morning and got a response in less than an hour
i mean who doesnt like chinese buffet
its is still 5 mins from the strip and away from traffic so the distance isnt an issue
the day after checking out the 556 went from a hold to an actual charge
the show description promises revealed secrets to many popular magic tricks
there are exceptions but certainly not for me in las vegas
all in all we will stay here again
i ended up ordering two just to zero in on it
the room i was in should not be allowed to be a massage room
i also like that theres a door separating the toilet to the rest of the bathroom
i love mujis products but hate this location
ive made huge meals in one and weve spent a week without hitting up the grocery store at all but its really nice to have the refrigerator and freezer
what can i say about hotel room service
guy working there was really nice and made great recommendations
when i called them for a shuttle they told me that one was coming without taking down my name or telling me how long it would be before the shuttle arrived
we booked a nice room with a pillow top mattress and a high roller view  but weve been told they have a construction going on at that part of tower and it will start at 9 am
corn on the cob was a bit mushy
one of the cleaner pool areas ive visited in vegas
that was just the beginning of their deceitfulness and rudeness we complained and asked to be moved to a room with water or give us a discount
unfortunately this was not the case when dealing with the hard rock
the food was amazing
thanks mama g  her son joked that she makes it right there and bottles it all herself
country fried steak and eggs make a gr8 breakfast
husband states he is not a fan of chain hotels but this  has changed his perspective
no beer on tap
in short the stage was incredibly designed with some parts moving the costumes were elaborate and the acrobatic moves were spectacular and like nothing ive seen before
delicious food appalling service
you mean that you did not plan ahead and have enough supplies on hand
plush pillows and sofas were spread out in deep ambers and mahogany that reminded me of arabian nights if they had hired an impeccable decorator
reading the prior reviews from other customers  this place really took a toll on the strip
one concierge gave us attitude but everyone else was great
and nightlife on saint catherine street via the subway station located right in front of the hotel
this just didnt have the feel of a hilton property
im definitely a fan
either way they are delicious and reasonably priced
we went the next to the last weekend of spring training and the outfield lawn was still in great shape beautiful green and manicured for those looking to track down a home run ball or crash on a blanket under the warm not hot arizona sun
hi daily dosei love you
i was greeted promptly played while i waited and returned to see if it was ready
and having someone divvy up the food ensures you get a shrimp
its a nice hotel with some rooms facing the golf course
i am so upset that i am almost in complete tears writing this review
a cozy place that has a great neighbourhood vibe to it
background white noise
i mean what are they az when it comes to the new law
youve seen the fountains in countless movies and tv shows
they need to fix the elevators in the parking garage though
had a nice morning bite to eat at a great price
oh and i like the fake 5 stars from marketers for ariaactually kinda obvious and funny
the parking garage is at 515 euclid if youre looking for it
had an amazing stay here for a conference that was at the same hotel
all i can say is i guess its good they dont have a location on the west side because i would go completely broke coming here
if nothing else it does add to the general ambiance of the establishment
to add to my tripits a business trip
its very empowering and inspiring
great job by american express
for this upcoming labor day we made reservations for two nights to stay for our one year wedding anniversary we will be arriving on 97 staying until 99
i wish the service was a little faster but it seems everything here is made fresh
dedicated registration desk  right next to the self parking easy inout and youre downtown
poached eggs for the benedict was perfect which made cutting into it and watching the yolk ooze onto the rest of the plate all the more fun
the rooms are spacious the pools are great  nice bars and we love pub 365 the best wings ever
our instructor nancy was a calm and creative guide to our hack crew
the comfort inn is a prime example of just how nasty this can get
the executive lounge is ok  you have access to a pc and a printer
which was pretty normal i guess i mean i can be pretty understanding
the balance of the meal consisted of chicken korma  wheres the chicken
sandwiches tried  moi the full montagu thanks to the multiple yelp recommendation
this is the place to grab a feed when in vegas
we closed out with a salted carmel pudding that was small and tasty
shower is generous size but water pressure and temp was only ok  tub is neither oversize nor jet in my book
after initially booking the package i was immediately contacted by tony via phone
spent over 200 and they charge us 8 for a bday slice of cakecome on
the staff are super efficient ensuring that any trip here is relatively pain free even if youre wallet is significantly lighter on the way out
strike one booked room on bookingcom and was charged a higher rate when we arrived at the hotel despite showing the front desk agent our confirmation number and email
it only cost 150 per person and you can go out and come back in with a hand stamp
bar with tv so youll not miss the game
they also make you feel super welcome
what a treat
the pricing is transparent and competitive the staff is genuinely friendly and you feel like they really appreciate your business
while most did their jars exactly as the instructor i decided i didnt like the stem and waterline concept and decided to fill my jars in and it came out great i feel
this was one of those nights
we arrived late wednesday night and checked in at tower 2 where we were assigned rooms in tower 1 with a distant view of the las vegas strip
along the way you can grab drinks and other goodies such as chips cookies and so on
are you kidding me
we will certainly try to get back before we head home
the food and drinks seemed substandard
pool on the earlier stay with family we checked out the pool
the experience i had was almost in real
very light and didnt make us feel sick or heavy stomached
our waiter was gone for long periods of time but when he came around he only serviced the tables next to us huh
two thumbs up to her
well 20 minutes later they sat another family whose reservation was later than ours
anyways we get seated finally and were in the corner
the rooms are clean and very unique and the parking was convenient and easy to carry in and out
i mainly come here to play the slot or bingo from time to time
there was also a coffee machine in the room
great gambling and great affordable restaurants and friendly staff and gorgeous cocktail servers
our last visit in addition to the aforementioned oysters and sourdough of course i tried the prawn and scallop skewer and my buddy tried the chinook
that is it
will return for sure
anyone who reads my reviews knows i am a fan of dive bars and interesting establishments but this place is quite simply too much for even me
omg this place is great
will be back
the only setback was that during the evening hours there was high demand for the butlers so the response time was often delayed but it wasnt like anyone was dying
theres plenty of parking near the lobby and it feels safe to walk tofrom your car
the only good experiences we had are the pool and the house hash a go go restaurant
the man never sleeps doesnt matter what time you call him hell reply
i had a small room with an adorable bathroom all of which had character
i would give no or negative star if the options were available
based on this experience alone i wouldnt be paid let alone pay myself to stay here
came here for a work trip
the entire dining experience was one we will never forget
the food is inside is too pricey but not many places outside to eat unless you want to get back into your car
the food was good great value
my husband and i walked in with our 35 year old girl and started laughing
hearing steve nguyens i mean wynns voice when turning on the tv dislikes while the room was nice and the art was intriguing the overall appearance was not too extravagant or distinguishable
this is an amazing spot in cleveland
i did wait almost half hour in line for cafe bellagio
i checked in and the young maiden at registration wrote down b27 51 on my key packet
this place is great
pretty awesome for a comp room and i didnt gamble a dime to earn it
the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll with melted swiss cheese and cole slaw was delicious
the food here is really good
a little sweet for my taste but i like that they used a couple different types of beans
they put us in a room all the way down the hall way past the pool and on a low floor so the only thing we had a view of was a vacant parking lot
i have to give these professional drivers a ton of creditthey are insanely good at what they do
i absolutely loved this place  this will be the only place iwe stay from now on in vegas
another dipshit pedophile type sat to my left as i was playing alone would take out 2550 bucks at a time jump in and out of the deck and play one hand every 45 each time not buying in more than 2550
oh and if you want to do a nature walk or a hike dreamy draw is less than half a mile away
we got seated with the most wonderful young gentleman i have every had the pleasure of meeting
unfortunately this does not outweigh the bad we experienced
order the matzo ball soup and the montreal smoked meat sandwich
if you need a luxury ride in the phoenix are i highly recommend lux rides
we both thought it was cool
well calculated choice of lodging
you can even sit with your legs in the pool and enjoy the show if youd like
crowd consists of people who have alot of money and people who want to look like they have alot of money
aussi je vous conseille davoir une bonne bouteille deau et quelques collations
but hell who cares about the price of the margarita when you are enjoying yourself so darn much
as others have mentioned the price was high
the shower had one tiny ledge to put your toiletries when i requested extra towels and pillows they delivered extra towels twice and i had to remind them about the pillows seriously
it wasnt huge but then it also wasnt packed
weve stayed here twice in budget rooms both times
they are right
for the price we wouldnt stay here again
again we wait
palms was my lucky casino
it would be nice to just have a menu for my table
take all you like
they also have the best pia colada  dont hesitate to check this place out
from the outside it is a comfortable looking chain establishment
theres no wow whatsoever
great fun for an evening of dinner drinks and golf with friends
not a bad hotel but certainly not one of the best on the strip
i staff was great the maids were very nice
next time we come to eastlake we will be staying somewhere else
my friends got in late thursday and the carson rooms were sold out they all were upgraded to the gold tower for no extra charge
the staff could not be nicer or more helpful
ironing bored but no iron
the rates are high for what you get and although the kids sleeping area is a cute novelty and the second tv was helpful the suites are rather small and the bathroom is laughably tiny and needed a deep cleaning
its no biggie tho i didnt make a fuss about it
our server recommend dijon with the crepes and it was amazing
i would never stay there again even if it was free
and completely oversalted
bought a groupon if free unlimited  game play which sounded awesome
great lakes brewery has a great little location in a part of cleveland that seemed really interesting to me from a visitors perspective
also drinks were ridiculously expensive
i went to look for the undergroundcovered parking
i really loved that the proprietors hands were stained with ink showing that she not only sells the pens but really uses and loves them
they need to make the food taste much better
supergeile location immer wieder gute djs 2 floors im sommer mit terasse gute cocktails netter service entspanntes publikum lohnt sich immer wieder mal reinzuschauen wobei es mir im sommer noch etwas besser gefllt da man gechillt auf der wunderschnen terasse flacken kann
next time i want to stay here
i got a room on the 17th floor
i think most little rugrats would love the train zoo and pony rides
we had been so excited to stay at this hotel and are so disappointed with this poor service and bait and switch tactic
i loved the metro at ellis island and the location at tropicana completely turned me off from the metro brand
we were left to chat in a very unhurried way and it was a great way to spend an afternoon
the taboulli tasted very bland i dont think there was any lemon on it all all
what i found to be more pleasurable with my recent visit was the parking
she was very unprofessional and clearly cannot handle her job of checking people in paying customers and taking phone calls
chateau was definitely a good time however i think their are better night clubs you could go check out on the strip
the people who work at orpheum are very nice
i didnt like the fact that when i checked in i ask for a late check out and the manager said yes you can check out late
the second you turned that circle green it was a bit overwhelming with how fast they come at you and ask you if you want certain cuts
restaurants get a rush
all the workers were friendly and helpful
the room itself i was put in the paradise tower and told at checkin that a king wasnt available so id get a queen
i ordered breakfast to my room and receive barely cooked poached eggs literally raw and found a hair in my fruit salad
this review of mgm grand is like so many other experiences in vegas  first youre up then youre down then youre even and if youre smart you get the heck out of there to live to play another day  you know youll be back
the waters left in the room by staff we highly appreciated
bonnie l your jacuzzi reference was from aladdinim a disney nerd what can i say
crappy beers no problem
we asked for a room change and they delivered
in fact one was singing the entire time to herself and didnt even look at me
i forget what the hours in which you didnt have to pay the meter but i basically scheduled my day around being gone at those hours so i didnt ever have to park in a shady lot that couldnt guarantee my cars safety
that can lead to epic scores when combined with other sales
worst hampton inn ive stayed at
from california ii rented a projector for my dads memorial in rhode island and everything worked perfectly
but go have a drink and check it out
same with pancakes that were all undercooked
horrible place to stay to many bugs and rooms were very dirty and front guy was a lazy ass didnt say how are you just give me the key
then she pulls out our pictures puts finger prints all over them btw and we start talking about the extras which they apparently print to try and up sell the pkg
hey megan its jerry who ordered the tv rental
so maybe next time
the day i checked in i asked for the strip view room and the rude lady checking me in said no there are no strip view rooms available
the manager went above and beyond to help make our kids christmas awesome
the breakfast here was wonderful
wow what a great place
the sad part is that in its early days it got panned for poor acoustics
my favorite was the happy hour at the sushi restaurant and im not talking about the sushi but the house chardonnay was delicious and only costed 5 dollars i believe
we checked in late wednesday night and the guy at the front desk just asked for our name asked for a credit card handed us our room keys and told us to see the bell boy about where our room was located and the amenities
pd extra for vip dj  pauly d dj booth tix to be told by the waitress that the venue had changed the dj booth to the stage that night and our only extra we got was free pop and a shitty laminated vip pass called the manager next day to voice complaint of obvious rip off and was spoken to rudely and told he didnt sell the ticketsno jerk off but you did change the regular setting of where dj booth was or i would have had booth tix
paradise cafe  pretentious on a budget
they definitely earned their title as the earl of sandwich
you mean chips dont come with it
there was hair in the bathtub one of the queen size beds had a ripped bedspread and dirty sheets on it the carpet was torn and there was a bottle cap on the floor from the previous guests
she ended up telling me thats the best i can do which is send someone to empty the garbage and then she hung up
service is fast and friendly
they do a great job
this was my second stay here and ill be back
loved my room which was a decent upgrade but nota typical out of this world vegas style upgrade
it completely transformed the room
you did a great job of supporting the event
the mushrooms broccoli and roasted carrots were excellent but i usually like to know which ones i am getting
however because the food was delicious and the manager did everything he could to make the situation right for us wed give this place a try again
after calling housekeeping and explaining the situation there was no apology of any kind
nothing ive had was rich and decadent like the goodies i expect from an awardwinning bakery
bed too close to wall
horrible experience checking in
even options i had considered a step up in the past now seem hopelessly dreary
the decor was sophisticated and cozy and the beds were decked out with the plushy warm down comforters and pillows that made nap time an everyday must
i really dug it and the vibe but the rooms were really meh
dave is a great instructor and they have created a fantastic environment for the kids and adults
montelucia may sport the best views in all of phoenix and scottsdale
boy were we wrong
dollarvaluelocation is a solid 5
overall if youre looking for a great party atmosphere at a great price then this is the place to go
mandalay beach was awesome i had no problem finding a chair at 6pm on saturday and again at 10am on sunday
the amenities are pretty good
three conversations with a manager got us no better service
only after check out do they bill your card
the room itself was nothing to write home about
i respect waitress service but seriously  some people dont deserve it
the rooms have been updated and have wood floors no rugs
the rooms are modern and clean with contemporary appointments httpwwwyelpcombizphotosrhevp5flf6koprimhmvyggselectgwicubmmiudzzj6jxt5o4qrpsm0luc0vglp0q5ke0rtg
there was nyc favorites like ben  jerrys and nathans plus higher end options like gallaghers and il fornaio
they charged for 2 nights when the hotel was already prepaid
as a restaurant the food is brilliant and well thought out
theee most comfortable hotel bed i have ever slept in
because of that i cant give them a high rating
service was mostly excellent though my table at the outer edge of the room had to summon waiters a couple of times when it seemed as if we were being overlooked
very friendly folks
i cannot beat this in vegas this close to the strip for 39night plus 19 resort fee
the place was clean front desk was very nice and helpful
tals is a great little deli with good sandwiches i dont like corned beef so cannot comment on that but have had some amazing deli creations from them
cheap hotel rates for sure
our server was great thanks haley
never staying here again
the puzzles were unique and appropriately challenging
all in all it was a wonderful way to celebrate our special day
entrees both of the lobster offerings spaghetti and meatballs lasagna prime rib chops and some kind of vodka pasta
we all got a starter two of us got the corn bisque and two of us got a salad
there was some edm but mostly rnb and rap so we could actually dance
downside  i reserved the cityscapes suite for my stay but for some reason in all the confusion i lost the reservation  but to make up for it they provided us with breakfast  which is to early for me but was nice of them and robes
theres a casino next door and with he train station there are some questionable folks and some vagrants hangings out nearby
its definitely an older crowd but still really nice
he called the front desk and the engineer guy came shortly thereafter with a large replacement tv
he assured us that the food was going to be fantastic and there was no reason to hesitate
we had a decent southwesttexmex breakfast there
blackjack tables were great except for the one moron dealer that scoffed at me when i asked for surrender
but it doesnt add up to that oohahh experience that i associate with the name doubletree and i keep my reviews 100 here as the kids say
the wine was delicious too
after some sampling i must say the shrimp touffe the jambalaya and my personal favorite the red beans with sausage were just to die for
overall it was a fun experience and i can see myself going back there
not too good
the shower looked great but the shower its self was so cheap its like they ran out of money
my 2 sisters and i stayed at ti over this past weekend to celebrate my older sisters 40th birthday
its not that bad
just an awful place to stay
pro one of the best times ive had just a very creative combination of a number of awesome things con super big missed opportunity
they should confine all cigars to a cigar smoking area dont let them just walk around with them
my wife  i recently stayed there during a lil date night venture on the strip what we found in our room was disgusting
this most recent visit was somewhat of a different experience we called the front desk to advise we would be arriving late and finally got settled in about midnight
maybe its because its the memorial day weekend anyway the room rates are cheap but the foods arent although the portions are pretty huge so i suggest you share if youre not a big eater they are heavily promoting the new italian restaurant bacio but havent had the chance to eat there maybe next time
thanks again red lion inn
below par sides i could forgive but the bbq being bad
the food was average but under seasoned especially salt
not a fancy steakhouseeven though they pretend to be
we bought a bottle to take home in fact but i only saw one wee little glass
ahhh vegas this time around my group of girls decided on the westin
i order the brisket with fries
delano hotel formerly known as thehotel is an all suite hotel from the mgm family
my friend said for what happened tonight you should at least honor my coupon
and then we stood outside waiting for 25 minutes before giving up and renting a car from hertz
but when we checked out another female at the front desk was very nice and helpful to us though
which makes things awkward because people are staring at you
it is very short so i thought that was nice too
all in all this was a horrible experience
first of all i ordered the charlie burger medium well with no mayo and no onion
they sent the engineer down to check it out
one of the items i always pick up in addition to any new cheeses is the cream cheese spreads
i didnt love the location
it has a full kitchen fully equipped with all the utensils
there is a miniconvenience store where you can also rent dvds
waited in line for 30 minutes before checkin safety briefing started 45 minutes late
no real happy hours probably wouldnt stay there again
both tasted mainly of budget artificial lemon aid drink mix
there are several other construction projects that make walking the strip a little difficult on this side of the street
the housekeeping staff is expeditious and friendly
surely a dominant mass a sleek and massive black pyramid there stands imperiously like a temple to the neterworld adding a distinctive mystical touch to the skyline especially in the evening when its light erupts from its point straight up into the night sky represented by set the egyptian satan which may symbolize the pharaohs flight
and it was hard to hear the names as they were called out over the music
only has one stall in the bathroom for men in the cafe area which is kind of sad
would like our pictures or our 200 or both
the roasted almonds just enough chocolate hints in the delicious pastry to make me swoon
thank you chef jae  your food is amazing
loved the vibe at delano
you can get better deals at other hotels close by including caesars a sister hotel
i figured it was going to be a dropoff from a courtyard by marriott but the dropoff was much more noticeable than i was expecting
the rest of the fam had regular pancakes cinnamon roll pancakes and an egg white and turkey sausage omelet
so when you come to the hotel the ground floor entrance is under scaffolding
i barely noticed it and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it
they deliver on what they promise which is not easy to find in this industry
everything from video games to go karts and batting cages makes it easy to spend a day at this location
if it is a matter of costs i am more than happy to add a few bucks to my meal costs but they were completely unwilling to do this
very personable and class acts
i would wright a nifty paragraph or essay about this hotel however being so that there are hundreds of reviews for this hotel i thought i would give you a pros and cons list of the luxor  pros room with a jacuzzi always a plus room service large buffet tender steakhouse  food court fine mexican food carrot top if your into that sort of thing criss angel again if your into that sort of thing titanic exhibit bodies exhibit open casino plenty of parking spa the cons hecklers all about the casino trying to sell show tickets old tvs in the room no lcd they charge 5000 bucks per night for movie rentals on your card
oh what an amazing time our bachelorette party had here
would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a great time and a challenge
i believe that my friend booked the bella suite and it was freaking huge
i stayed at the hilton the previous year there was definitely a difference in overall quality but you get what you pay for and i do think this place has some good things to offer
but if you just want a hotel room where you can unwind and be pampered by good old fashioned service and amenities this aint your place
if this hotel were in better condition i feel that the rooms and the restaurant would be booked to capacity all the time
express elevators that skip all the unnecessary floors
im still thinking about the wonderful meal and thanks to jeff our waiter for great service
i stood there 8122016 and someone robbed us while we were asleep the door didnt lock unless you put the top lock on so they must of knew and pushed the door and got in and we were asleep they knew exactly where the phones and purse wallet  was
valet parking suite dwellers move to the front of the response time  excellent
being an australian product i was very worried as my last jar was getting very low and i feared that shipping it here could take a long timehowever i remembered heather l had mentioned there was a store in scottsdale that sold it and i found i had scribbled the name down on a piece of paper cost plus
we did some light gambling and had some drinks after checkin but i literally couldnt stop thinking about the bathtub
if youre in montreal for business or watching a habs game you should consider this hotel as its in close proximity to business district and bell centre otherwise i wouldnt try to impress anyone with it
lake las vegas has a lot to offer and this is definitely something you should check out
everybody has a bad day occasionally so i think i need to give this place another shot
i could spend an hour just looking through everything in this cute little store
the only thing that we found weird is that the tv doesnt have many channels and there is no payperview option
the museum was not crowded and the exhibits were professional and interesting
i will give crop bistro another try the next time ill try a different time different day
the aroma was worth every sneeze
the guys at the pro shop are nice but the course has alot of blind shots is not that great quintero was awesome
bottomline is its pretty hard to get some much needed r and r in this hotel
had the appetizer sampler with chips and spinach  artichoke dip chicken tenders mozzarella sticks and chimichangas
pick this chapel if you are looking to get married in vegas
the minor passed out on the floor got immediate attention but my play received none of any kind
it can get expensive and note they only take cash
we begrudgingly packed and went downstairs only to get our same room back
we could not have asked for a better experience
crop is one of the few restaurants in cleveland ive been to repeatedly
where was the bar
to put ones name on the list one must approach the podium which is so tall and intimidating it feels like approaching the bench in court
separate reviews on those later
there was no announcement from whomever opened the door and they closed the door before i could get to it
end of story
well you probably need to pay your employees more
mysterious resort fee that covered nonexistent wifi
the room we stayed in wasnt cleaned while we were there but im not sure this is actually a service offered in the bnb but there were signs provided to hang on the door
the service is average
i wanted to use a groupon but one of the items ordered was a grill item and the voucher states you cannot order grill items using the coupon
i did come here for work and had no intention on gambling
ok first time writing a review for any service on yelp
sandwiches at next table looked great so i would probably go that route along with some other appetizers
pay more and stay somewhere else
everything i have had is amazing and everyone who works there goes beyond to be nice
alec baldwin would approve
youll most likely want to stop by the pool after that
customer service was excellent and the food was good
i loved how the cameras were no longer something she used to threaten me after that
not 3 star michelin stuff like further down the strip but great value for what you get
thank god they switched me and i was honored to have isabella help make the day happen
i still have not made it out to make money
who does that on vacation
for my entree i had the prime rib sandwich with german potato salad
other kids have pushed my son down and i heard a little girl scream at another one that she wasnt allowed in the playhouse
i dont eat bad around the holidays for good reason
but of course being in vegas i am guessing things are done differently than in say pittsburg or any other courtyard
the spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in 2 for tasty leftovers if you can stop eating
4th floor smelled strange almost like sewagefarts for the first two days of my stay
wow this place is so grand compared to its old location on w6
we reserved two tables in the backyard and had the picnic lunches  lemonade catered and it was a huge hit
we were assured the small portion was big enough for two
the sides were great
she immediately knew what she could do to make it work and we planned to meet again when i had the necessary decorations made to test it out
when we checked in on saturday december 5th i was advised that we were bumped out of our club level room reservation by a spg platinum member which i am perfectly ok with i understand how it works
overall there is nothing special about this hotel
this is our favorite mexican restaurant in madison by far
highly recommend it
checkin took over an hour at 4 pm on a friday evening
the restaurant was clean and everybody was pleasant
in fact we mentioned it to a family that we met while on a tour to the hoover dam the next day and suggested that they go and visit the ranch for it is an exceptional experience
so terrible i didnt even complain i just wanted out of there
oh well they now have to pay the price of loosing a future customer  a bad review
while at the pool when the wind shifted i could smell the sewage again
ok im going against the grain here
the owners are very sweet and are happy to tell you more about each line  especially the locally made goods
we explained that we are not trying to dispute the resort fees but she did not explain herself in a way that was clear
the place is awesome
the facilities were super clean and spacious
thank god they didnt listen to them because when their dresses came in in their actual size they fit them fine
well worth the money and it helped keep some of the nondancing people entertained
this chain is weird the chicken is ok and all but i dont get the people standing outside to take your order at the drive through this is phoenix az
all the windows are bolted shut and no vents in the restrooms to air out the steam
but its where my friends wanted to stay
if you plan on getting flat out drunk each night you stay in vegas do i have the place for you
i think he just assumed we were smoking something illegal
my room was facing the lake and i could not see the tower at all not even its shadow or reflection
so closest and dog friendly was the element
this hotel is gross
at times it can get a little awkward when the magicians assistants are trying to engage the audience which can be pretty funny
also there are loud airplanes constantly flying right above the room
did not get maid service the first day but let it go as an oversite
you can pay as you go or you can purchase a package which saves you a little bit of money
you can thank the makers of the bellagio fountain for the new volcano
just dont keep the veggie dishes in the fridge too long to avoid spoilage
the wallpaper was filthy peeling and patched in different spots
also the lens was a little off center and we felt it took too long between shots so guests didnt realize there was going to be four flashes or they got impatient
we had a reservation for 4 nights for a wedding celebration
wie denn der deftige schwbische wurstsalat so sei fragte waldorf kraska die statler gattin
mean while we were the only people waiting for a car so you would think this tool would at least come up to us to ask
there was also extremely loud construction next to the bakery for 2 days of our visit
also stephanie our waitress was very attentive
thats four strikes
a lot more to do for the same amount of money
had the awesome ryan as my instructor  the equally awesome elizabeth helped me check in
i take by coffee by necessity i order them when theres nothing on the menu or i have to borrow the washrooms at timmy or mcdonald
front desk was very helpful
definitely worth a visit if in the area
my husband felt the beds were to hard and too small since we had a room with two beds for our children instead of one with a king size bed
have asked time and time again about tours often the answer is something like im not sure what were gonna do it again but we used to do it always this time and that time doesnt really help
he knew how to take care of his party and show them a great time
ive been eating guidos pizza since they opened in euclidi live in california now and whenever i come back to cle i always get a pizzaeating a cold slice now at the airportit is the best
dealing with the rumor hotel was the worst hotel experience of my life
i would go back to have a drink but probably not to eat
however i do think if youre someone from out of town or i guess even local  youre looking for a multinight stay at a resort thinking youre getting a steal here i think youll be disappointed
i wasnt expecting much for the money but i chose it because they advertise a bar restaurant and gaming and
that was a lot of pennies though it was just printed on a ticket
other than that we had a great time and i would recommend it to anyone
very dissatisfied and will take our business elsewhere in looking at hotels the next time we stay in pittsburgh
the coffee shop was excellent with a great location and a very short walk from waverly train station and all of the sites in  city
is this the sad ending to a once extremely popular hotel
this is not your typical cookie cutter big chain resort
im not sure if the delay in food arrival was due to the employee or potentially a behindthescenes mishap in the kitchen
i do most of my gambling at the venetian so its a toss up at which one ill stay at next time
this was delicious
we stayed here the night before we flew back to dc
all around a thumbs down
we were never asked if we wanted dessert
this hotel is in a very convenient neighborhood with a major metro hub right outside
we had breakfast at mr luckys which was very good and reasonably priced
and dont pass the hotel off as new
the sweet coconut tatiyas were nothing short of amazing
well be looking forward to booking you guys for our next family event
the food was cold then
we feared the worst and were not disappointed135 each plus a 20 tip already included all totaling close to 400 for this wretchedly mediocre extremely late and unimaginative prix fixe feast
room was clean had semi balcony doors opening to the pool view and a super comfy bed
my friend even got stuck in the elevator
and the facility was huge and very well decorated it feels alot more high end than the casino itself
we had a wonderful experience
the shower in the master room was an oversized jacuzzi tub that was very difficult to get in and out
as a cheap alternative to the central hotels when they want to charge 200300 this hotel is great
great shop all around
first cirque du soleil show we see and we truly enjoyed every second of it
a little ghetto but smart
we stayed here two years ago and again this week
just a corkscrew
for one thing a lot of people who frequent this casino just dont have any sense of fashion
i will not be returning to this place
great place to stay in phoenix
oh yeah hes old and is still using pictures of himself from 20 years ago for promotional ads
other than that everyone was very unimpressed w the food and the price we paid for it
bring your own food dont plan to play here just sleep thats all its good forand please do not pay for rock of ages
in other words none of their room doorways are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair
so be prepared to spend time at one of their bars or have some food while you wait
the carpets are filthy wear whit gym socks youll see
my room was clean the bed was comfortable there was free internet and free coffee in my room and i even had a nice sized balcony
the food remains top notch best quality but the service wow theyve always gone out of their way but this time the service was incredible
just a thought
we are not gamblers so they were patient with our amateur ways
sorry guys i dont necessarily get it
granted i dont work there or know what its like for the managers but the added tension when theyre hovering around can be a bit uncomfortable
fee warning they charge a rip off 17night service fee in addition to the room rate
i couldnt use the pool because i didnt had enough time but it seemed really clean
this is when it not only gets petty but confusing
after requesting a box for my leftovers which they package so nicely for you
my boyfriend gets the chicken and rice and hes very pickyhe loves this place
one would think when you have a large group of people that all attend the same meeting at the same time reservations could coordinate with catering so they could properly staff their service areas to accommodate the expected rush
i liked my burger
there are many other ways to decline the temporary card to show understanding and care for the customers
we had toured the place and put a deposit down for a wedding later this year
the continental breakfast is better balanced than a lot ive had
best ribs ive ever eaten and very reluctantly shared 12 rack with my daughter
i mean probably not the healthiest dishes
they apologized and corrected their mistake a when we get to our room we walked in and are greeted with the beds right away very little walking space i believe they made single bed rooms into doubles
my third visit was for a late lunch after a friend had finished his game
i have never recommended a business with such enthusiasm as i can express for boudoir in bloom
it was so good in fact that we came back the next day
i am a frequent vegas visitor and have been to this casinohotel numerous times
i found a fingernail in my beer at the aurora bar
vegan option ask for a veggie sandwich with artichokes roasted red peppers mushrooms and spinach
this was the worst experience of my life
oh and the cafe they make a good apple martini  overall the hotel was great
none of us had been there before and we werent sure what to expect whether there would be a line to get in etc
i called this hotel to make sure i was booking a 2 bed room suite i ask the girl more then once more then twice  before i booked the room is it the two bed room suite she told me yes i called the next day to comfirm the reservation and of course it was wrong i asked to speak with the manager and thats when she called me with that stank attitude she asked me if i wanted to  cancel or buy another room are you serious
if i could give 10 stars i would
the check in kine wwas king but went by very quickly
i look forward to spending lots of time here it is a beautiful location
she stated that it would be free to set up the table
the checkout kiosk did not work for me told me to go the front desk and i had to wait inline for a long line  totally wasted my time
stopped in for week night dinner and was seated right away
its opened 247 and thats awesome
this was our first visit to famous daves
service at the inside counter was lacking
it is exactly like you hope it will be
we had bottle service because it was our friends birthday
you also get a free 15 to play when you first sign up
rooms are dark
das lokal ist bekannt fr seine schwbischen spezialitten und so whlten wir semmelkndel mit pfifferlingen und spargel mit kruterfldle
a couple coats of paint to get rid of the graffiti in the parking garage wouldnt hurt either
do you know what makes a flamingo pink
the room was large and dry comfortable
it wasnt that loud except minor hearings of the riders screaming which didnt bother my friend and i the room had ac which we were able to adjust to our preference very nice
i love the crispy cakelike thingy that came with it
its fairly close to the strip and connected to plant hollywood
you needed to go up a spiral staircase to reach the first floor landing
we should of got beers instead
i was hoping to snag a few unused samples back home but i used up everything
i also tried some of the restaurants downstairs and hung out at the race and sports book area
super yummy sandwiches and soups
we are here for spring training and games start at 1pm
theres a few cardio machines and a full weight rack but as far as weight machines go  theres basically nothing
this is my local taco spot in vegas so far
but wait it also had a garden bathtub with whirlpool jets
this place is off the strip but close to hard rock cafe bavarian restaurant and other mexican italian asian restaurants and cvs
leaving us only 5 hours of sleep until our grand canyon tour next day at 7am which we almost missed
our hearts just werent in it
subway restaurant inside casino beds are comfy 2 restaurants in hotel  cons floor 9 no great views ice machine was broken on our floor no buffets in casino  overall this hotel wasnt so bad
we arrived by taxi and let the games begin
the floors were unbelievable
from the sweet salty  texture perspectives we were thoroughly satisfied
theyre dinuguan pinakbet and tocilog are so delicious youll feel like your in the philippines
very entertaining people watching
they were all so nice to us and didnt mind joking around with my friends and i wish more dealers were as chill as these guys
our steps echoed as we made our way to the front desk
i opened the doors of the spa and entered a small checkin table where the staff greeted me with smiles and charm
i came in yesterday to get 6 small bundts for my boyfriends birthday
make sure you have your expectations in order when you come here
first time going to virgils
there are ice machines which are fast but are located outside and thus dont look clean
the check in staff etc is great
wed like to call out that the spa should be considered on its own merit and would receive a 5 out of 5  specifically kelsey in the salon section does a great haircut
thank you so much mirage limousines and kevin for all you did to make this night a special one for the kids
check in lady says i booked a king smoking
i mean i dont need to be able to make my own waffle but can i please have some butter for my grits
clearly there should have been because you could see the spots on the wall where there used to be adhesive
so my little writing staycation at the golden gate scored for under 5000 on groupon was not what i thought it would be
the outdoor patio is a rare treat in the downtown phoenix area
the only downside was one of the people that was with our group thought he was tiger
i guess if you live near here and frequent the place it might be decent
it remains one of my most traveled to casinos and a place that brings me back to my childhood days
get the flautas
update  the chompies in scottsdale sent us a gift card to apologize for our experience
they have mini golf but thats extra
and it came with the right amount of horseradish sauce
dust bunnies on the drapes
i think i do better with dumb luck anyways
last year we stayed at bellagio which was a disappointment from the 30minute long checkin wait to the inroom safe locking us out to our room not being cleaned one of the three nights we were there
i highly recommend this place
for now our next visit for december has been booked and we are staying at the palazzo
the windows dont open and the ac barely functions so everything has that musty stale air funk smell to it
i was unimpressed with caesars palace especially since caesars palace markets so much hype behind its name
i probably wont be coming back because i have the type of personality that always wants to try something new but its about the quality and service youd expect from a 4 star place
will be having headshots taken but from my initial impressions of bob and his services i couldnt recommend him more
overall the hotel lived up to the trump brand
wenn man aber zu guterletzt auf die rechnung blickt wird einem das sowas von egal sein
but is not within walking distance of the strip
if youre looking for a vegas getaway  on the strip a fun environment with lots of entertainment onsite stay away
lets start with the positives
we were thrilled to go back for a second visit
he went to go in steam room for ten minutes after his workout and was told it would be a twenty dollar charge on top of the 3000 resort fee we just paid
an actor came on stage to tell the audience the rules
the author had to restart his talk because no one could hear
im a big penn and teller fan
dont let the cheap food signs outside fool you
example  i ordered mango lassi  it took 25 minutes and 3 reminders to arrive
had a 6am call that day and got 3 hours of sleep
i opted to swap out my fries for greens
i cant be too sure but i think he was also giving me a look
i came to discover during my stay that all the elevators were beat up
a week or so later when they called to tell me the dress was ready i quickly dropped everything to go get it
saw a show in the capitol theaternot a bad seat in the house
our server was exremely friendly like woah although the staff all together seemed a little dazed
i cant wait to go back
the bugs
they offer a pool and a few amenities
some hotels feel stuffy and formal
the balloon was the most tastefully decorated of the fleet
food comes out fast
he handled the conversation in a very professional manner and explained the situation in extreme detail
there is a swimming pool on the premises
main dual veal veal and veal raviolis looks small on the plate but very filling
i had previous guests warn me about the staff and service at red rock
this didnt happen
within the first hour maintenance came to our room unrequested to bring us something for the shades and something for the bathroom
its much faster if there is no need to talk to a front desk employee
they have a go green program which i thought was kinda cool
it took almost 20 min to have someone take our order never got refills on our drinks and the check even took forever
the room had a hole in one of the walls
the good  the pool area is great
luckily i had packed some dry food in case i did not have the luxury of a stove or fridge
i couldnt get hot water the first night and the guy who came to fix it said that the hot is cold and the cold is hot
i personally think the over achieving reviews stem from the very poor food  the restaurants in anthem out out so this actually may seem good in comparison but for myself i for sure will not be returning for lunch or dinner
you should eat the whole one though because then we have a foundation of respect
the only thing i thought was odd was happy hour is only served at the bar and not the dining area
room service is also available
so im a fan of being a tourist in your own city so for my birthday i arranged an evening for my husband and i to spend in downtown sans baby
both seemed to taste as if they included canned ingredients
it was completely covered in sugar
i made the right decision selecting acropolis for this special event
the breakfast in the bistro seemed high for what it was but it was tasty
we had a full cocktail hour with passed hors doeuvres followed by a meal presented at several stations an oldfashioned ice cream sundae bar for dessert and then dancing all in 3901 at marigold
i definitely reccommend getting your tickets at a tix4tonoght stand though otherwise its kind of an expensive evening
at first i thought the menu was also part of the comedy and the food was just edibleish
i have a friends wedding to attend in 12 hrs  need sleep  a shower before the wedding
yet on the 4th of july we found ourselves walking to el cortez in an area of fremont street which had a lot of noticeable police activity
manager never available
we did not eat breakfast lunch
the staff was friendly and the food came out quick
i would never go back to chateau again
we then had another server jump in who was great as well
also bottomless arnold palmers and kosher pickles
the only buffet i come to because they have unlimited fresh lobster
she experiences the photographs as you are experiencing it
the gambling area is nice and the buffet is surprisingly good with very fresh choices for a reasonableish price
i cant believe i actually spent money for this show
i couldnt understand why they would even serve that
i wanted to try everything even they came to central oregon
it turned out to be the perfect room for my 17yr old son because of his knowledge of that time era
this was damn good bbq
inside the place does have all the fun stuff and we played pong foosball cornhole and checked out the shop and boxing ring too
on the weekends satsun
when my husband mentioned a downstairs suite the young lady checking us in made it sound like they had already gotten our luggage microwave  fridge set up in the upstairs suite which they had not
know their city well
i also think the prices are very fair considering the handmade nature and timeintensive screenprinting process
the pasta puttanesca is overthetop rich
i plan to stay there again
watch it from home man
also pool was drained and front desk seemed unconcerned
the hot food is ok frequently the roast turkey is too salty
service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait
he said he would go back and modify the bill
that was a bad moment in my vacation because it makes me feel not important
2 appetizers french onion soup
ideally theyd have more asian art suits of samurai armor something thematicallyappropriate
too bad i would have given four stars on my choices
he borrowed the clothingdecorations from a friend who is a fan
everyone should order it
save on taxis by walking plus
which for steak and fries isnt the most appetizing
my fiance and i live with our extended family in glendale and sometimes we need to get away for the weekend
we all wanted to stay in close together and excalibur was conveniently located to luxor and monte carlo
the true test
the service is never consistent
haha the room itself was a decent size
the rice was cooked perfectly and the portion size was huge
overall over priced except we had a voucher
ive been thinking about doing their dairy food csa and i think this solidified the deal for me
thank you so so much
for those staying behind to do some lastminute studying or trying to get through the next class at asshours in the morning there is a starbucks as well to serve your caffeine needs
food court pretty good during the day and definitely not bad at 4am
underwhelming and inconsistent front desk staff esp in the evening
i booked a two night stay via the total rewards website for a classic guest room for 25night
they looked so careless and didnt even look like they cared that the party was about to start
the random people in attendance that we talked to all seemed to be having a good time and surprisingly little attitude
location this hotel is in a great location for just about everything in tempe and downtown phoenix
to my added unpleasantness i had to call  call my friend until he woke up and dropped it off 30mins later
once the maids saw the stain the main maid with attitude blonde curly haired woman said we were on drugs i dont understand where you get a grape soda stain to be drugs but anyways
its 4am and its still going strong
then we made our way down to the truck to get the rest of our things when we realized we couldnt even get out the front door
they made me feel like i was the only bride in the world even though there was another wedding right outside
ok so if you like american italian food this is a very average
stayed here because of the free shuttle service within 3 miles
service was a little confusing
anyway this is  a good hotel if you are on a budget but be ready to walk if you want to visit other hotels on the strip
the end result was a beautiful family photo that we were able to gift our parents as well as ourselves
that was sort of awkward when we first realized it but ended up working out fine as were both decent elevator chatters
right away i think i fell in love with the architecture and design of the restaurant
although the rest of the weekend was a blur i can say that the bachelor that i host will remember the kick penthouse with the skyline view we stayed in
it has plenty of toys and my little boy loves being here
you really cant go wrong
the eating area is outdoors which is the only drawback
the one positive thing i have to say are the beds
they have a pre fix 7 course valentines day menu for 50 a couple
now my kids know what pot smells like
overall our experience with this chapel was great and i wouldnt have done it any other way
i got half way past and almost started crying liked las vegas isnt depressing enough
what door to wait by what the shuttle looked like and eta
as i stated before this is my fourth year staying here and my stays consist of  5  7 day per stay
several award winner according to them including a mens journal top 25 beers in america
the deal seemed good but after my facial i only stayed an hour because i ran out of things to do
this is the best hotel experience i have had in a long time
my girlfriend and i have been here a few times whenever i am in town
the maid had to wash all our dirty platesbut we tipped a lot more than usual
service was prompt and all the food was very tasty
i am late writing this but i experienced the greatest customer service from these people
how very unvegas of them
this place was just splendid
why open a place if its not organized
or maybe because it was just friggin delicious
then the beautiful view of the strip laid before us
i dont think id go back for a few years when hopefully vegas changes its landscape again
its got a nice big shower but the water pressure is a little weak but the shower head is a rain type so it works
for over 100 per night this place is a total dump
it is old run down and feels like they are getting ready to bring it down
reuben melt is the best order
dislikes because parking spaces were reserved for the valet service the hilton and hertz it was very hard to find a parking place in the ramp
this is a complaint we sent to hilton after a recent stay
he sat in it and started the engine and made it appear out of thin air
based on what others have said here i should have used priceline to get one of the newer rooms for about the same price
avoid these scamsters and bunch of liars
i hate being treated with no enthusiasm
its always packed and ive always heard great things so we decided to go last friday for restaurant week
15 minutes later she called me back and told me she had made a mistake
the food was very good
loved the vibe here on a thursday evening  not too terribly crowded but there were no downtown events scheduled
check out the photos i uploaded and see the finalists here  httpswwwthecrepeclubcomvotehtml
the beds were pretty comfy
i give the show three stars first star is for the opening sequence
i love the westgate towers
i was about 12 done and i got severe heart burn and an upset stomach from it
the beds were so comfy and the view was just so amazing
well what happens next
maybe we were the ones being weird by not wanting them to come into our room for days at a time but i think a hotel needs to be able to accommodate that
but this chickfila does not make me feel im having fast food
otherwise it would be far to rich for my blood
i will definitely recommend her to my friends and hit her up next time im in vegas
im still not quite sure whether the penance i would pay was a setup
i would recommend that you do not waste your money here because you could be spending thousands of dollars worth in the end
having my high school serve sardellas pizza as a regular lunch item everyday further reinforced it
take care of the bug problem
like others on yelp i attended a happy hour that was won by a friend
whats not to like here
we ordered beignets with nutella and homemade blackberry jam
wish they would get it right again
the replacement arrangement looked a lot fresher but still not the quality of what was posted on the for you flowers site
go go go and while you are there try all their flavoured margaritas
this is deceiving to your guests because it isnt a view of the strip as guests would expect  charge us more for a piece of crap view of the recessionhalted and incomplete construction of the fountain blue circus circus some empty desert  and who knows what else
although there are instructors wandering around the park
after 90 minutes of waiting at 1030pm the back 40 of the line started to morph into a monster cluster cutting off about 200 people waiting ahead of them
if i had received my dvd with the additional dances on them it would have been 5stars all the way
the monorail is also a 5 minute indoor walk away which means you can get to the las vegas convention center easily or to a number of other strip locations
they charge a resort fee for it  so make sure you use it
our experience was absolutely wonderful
but while waiting
if you cannot handle reading reviews not to your liking then i suggest not reading reviews at all
good job chuck e cheese
there are staff circulating the dining room asking if you need a beverage refill or anything else
one more fat tire palease
steak and fries were excellent
even with 1600 square feet of space i felt like i couldnt breath in our room
stayed at aria on 71610 had wanted to check out the hotel for a while
since the owner and gm dont follow the view that the customer is always right i think you will suffer as a result
opentable let me make a sunday brunch reservation for today at 1100  imagine my surprise when we arrived and they informed usextremely rudelythat they opened at noon
my favorites were the spare rib appetizer and the two salads
the corner suite view is just ok but the view is 180 degrees
it ended up being the room next door
i was there over the summer for my anniversary it was a great location rooms were uptodate the staff was extremely helpful and it was very well keptclean
however i was quite disappointed after my last visit to purchase some marscapone and lady fingers preferably savoiardi for a tiramisu recipe only to discover they had neither
gold i dont know whats are covering the entire wall i forgot to take a picture of it but it looks like other yelpers were impressed as well
their ranch is sooooo good nothing like it anywhere else
vom pullover und jeans bis anzug mit krawatte war alles vertreten
the oatmeal was incredible and the only reason i did not skip breakfast
the parking attendant was incredibly rude and said in a matteroffacttone well if you check the website youll see that parking isnt guaranteed
it is in a great location city center
heres my suggestion get higher quality meats
dont make fun of them in front of your other customers
we tried their steakhouse restaurant and it was decentive had better but it wasnt bad
we went here since other places were packed
room 308 as they open directly into the pool area without giving up any privacy
dont know never stayed there
our freezer has a few 4 packs sitting in there and i love it cause its a mix of all my favorites
once in a while i let them play
stayed here on the weekend of march 2830 check in was at 3pm
and oh is that a treasure trove of fun
i had no idea what to expect which was good because i would have been wrong
although you could tell they are still going through renovations it was clean food in the restaurant was decent and it was not far from the strip
its worth paying to get the 1 bedroom suite and saving by taking advantage of the kitchen amenities
the free breakfast downstairs is much better than most places
but seriously go for the tiramisu macaron
we went to hard rock for a concert so we decided to gamble a little   went to the bar to get change for the waitress so i could tip her  he sends me to a cash advance machine
der die das zubereitet hat
come during weeknights which is as low as 45 up to 109 or more on weekend nights rate are higher on upgraded rooms but still good price
i got a seaweed bath with a minifacial
also checkin is horrible and way understaffed
the room was nice new and clean
always wonderful cuatomer service
the pools are nice
although three hours away we make the trip at least once a year
although our chips were salty we still enjoyed the rest of the meal
i hate kathy griffin do not play her stupid commercials
this is not a fancy hotel but it was quiet clean and comfortable
will definately come back
the food was worth the wait
had a great 5 day stay here
love that i can get a salad in the grab and go breakfast is also good
the basics didnt taste to par hey  competition is high
i was happy with the room it was clean and roomy
this place is great and it would get 5 stars but the location for us was too far away
thanks monte carlo you guys were great
the staff a nice gentleman called luxury suites and promptly corrected the problem
you have to pay 10 to rent one
the food was very good and the staff was nice
un htel 4 avec un look un peu kitsch mais des plus sympathique
made to order and was it yummy
service is way too slow
one line is elite dedicated
the only redeeming staff member was taylor super sweet and took her time on one of our three pedis
the rooms are just like motel 6  south point is what ever to me
i work in the fashion industry and travel a lot
we get there and instead of 2 queen beds in each room standard in almost every hotel there were 2 double beds
but the food was nothing spectacular i ordered a 4 meat sampler with beans and potato salad
goodbye old buddy vegas greed got you now
since we were celebrating her house selling and her moving on to the next phase of her life hey why not
they was also very nice and it turned into a really fun time with all the girls
carriage house is great
the people at the front desk was super nice and helpful
i will definitely be back when i visit phoenix
at the gas station i had to put 50 in the suv and 100 between the two jet skis
while our wedding was small they do larger weddings as well
one of my two favorite mexican places in the chandlergilbert area
a two rating seems a bit harsh but i have experienced better
came here last night for a show with one of my friends
its complicated to check in for some reason but once you get situated its a good time
nice and big and the fact that they let us set up shop for an entire day is quite cool
we always have a nice clean room the check n is courteous and quick
i always feel like i am in small town when i come here and even though the fake sky has been done at a few other places i still love it
it truly was our happily ever after wedding like we wanted and it was only made possible by the staff and owner of sunset gardens
if they would just fix a few issues it would be my all time favorite and id stay every time i come here
some peoples direct modifications were honored including my modification to the tail end of my stay
the front desk was nice as well in terms of service
you have to request blankets from the front desk
ill be waiting to see my final charges on my cardwhich better not reflect any extra charges
instead of wasting more of my time to contact management i will never go back after 25 years of baja burritos
wish me luck
ive been to the hub cafe a few times to meet people for coffee or lunch on businessy sort of meetings
as my boyfriend pointed out it seemed about the same as the rooms at flamingo
be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour just for an appetizer
was kicked out of our table for reservations on a tuesday night due to the fact of not ordering food right away
i will be back again in a few months because of the staff at every department
my stay at harrahs was great
if youre looking for a place that doesnt have the smoke and noise of a casino and just want an organization that focuses in on your hotel stay and experience
wtf after waiting 1 hour just to be sat  we found we were being skipped due to her poor language barrier and then we weresat the food
i dont want to give away the secret but you have to check out the ladies room
like 350 for draft beer
there is a little pizza joint in here that is like being back in brooklyn
getting to our penthouse rooms was another challenge
we didnt try the food so please dont use this review as a basis for that but we did stop in for one of the giant brownie sundaes
the ritz carlton in montreal is simply perfection
this review serves as more of a warning for anyone entering the mgm
3 the remote controlled curtain opener and closer did not work properly
great resort for adults that enjoy golf with two golf courses on the premises
i had no clue who the videographer was that showed up to my wedding
there were a few injuries while i was there even one bad enough to clear the rink
they are very kind fair priced and accommodating
it seems other yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor ac units
the best thing was that the restaurant was just lovely and the service was superb
valet  about 75 of the time we approached the valet desk there was no one there
if i ever make it to madison again ill be back to rockin jump
just cant remember all their names
i recommend this place
however once i was finished they handed me a parking pass and asked me to put in my dashnot a big deal just a total pain in the rear when im standing in the lobby with all my luggage and garments etc
management and the kitchen needs to step it up and keep us coming back
we will definitely be back here
i loved how the lobby and the elevators especially were not crowded and busy
the odd thing was that no one bothered to replenish our room with wash cloths
harrahs contains the oyster bar which is one of my favorite places in vegas
4pm check out time at no additional cost
our rom had no view
fine with me
despite that the dopamine rush you get from playing car games shooting games and spin the wheel is undeniably great
at certain moments i loved the indigo and at other points i was frustrated and disappointed
in vegas you shouldnt spend much time on the room anyway
i cant speak highly enough of the food here
having the monorail so easily accessible was a major perk as we frequently rode
i was told i didnt have a coffeemaker in my room so they offered to move me but when i got to my room there was a coffeemaker there
i will be back to sample more of their food and sin some more
kendra would say no worries we will make it work
both have lots of room in the main room with large bathrooms with jetted tubs for the wife and a big shower for me
stay someplace else if you want good service in vegas
and thats where im at now
my mouth is still watering
however with new technology comes new problems
bisher immer gengend platz sogar mit kissen die man sich holen kann
we couldnt refuse so we booked it
rotblotts goes with the large paint stores in the area like bacon and eggs so lets hope they can continue to serve the downtown residents forever
the only one that works is the one in the bathroom
fortunately there were a lot of them so i piled them up
this didnt seem to make sense
he was kind courteous and helpful
service was outstanding and my overall experience here was pleasant
the casino floor itself is super tiny
i dont think it was really worth the money for this package quite pricey and came to 63 with 17 mandatory tips
stayed here a few months back great hotel very friendly staff will definitely stay here when i come back
no arguments about sending down tech to adjust the sound and lighting for the rooms
a cleaning person that was riding with us says it happens all the time
checking out was a breeze as we checked out on the 23rd floors concierge lobby rather than downstairs or in our own room
if you are rolling through concord and need a hotel
overall it was a great time cheering yelling and waiving my terrible towel with the other faithful fans
all of those places i mentioned are good businesses
the bed was very comfortable as was the sofa
karen greeted up upon check in
there are other local businesses where my money is welcome
by the time everything was ready for the kids to go on it was 200  within 10 min of the kids playing on it the pool water was completely drained and a huge leak was revealed
so glad they are expanding and i dont have to drive so far when i have a craving
i would definitely skip this place and visit one of the many other food establishments at town square
as furious as i was inside by what this guy was saying and how he was saying it i remained calm and tried to speak to him nicely and figure out what was going to happen next
this is terrible
the pillows were to die for
very good flavors and presentation they agreed
he said you dont want anything i said no
this one lady in particular had absolutely no customer services skills and was beyond rude to me
its not quite fremont st but definitely far from palmsvenetianbellagio
the sitting areas are pulled off the street a little so you arent right next to all the noise of the passing cars not that there are many on that street anyway and it has this cafe setup
the place does timeshares too if that tells you anything
the hotel itself is in a very nice location
the same guy that took our order got our drinks and made our iced coffee
the nigiri rice was so hard that it tasted like over night rice
im ashamed of the employees inside
as part of city center plaza there are even more options in all areas
rooms are over sized compared to hilton and marriott in the banking district
i even appreciated some of his insight
i do not think this is appropriate to ask a paying customer
and yes i have been to paris france and yes this is the cartoon version of paris france but cmon people its las vegas
the housekeeping staff is really friendly
dont book a conference here
i think we were so impressed we overlooked that on the menu
vegas is used to handling large crowds and the staff at wedgewood are no exception
would i stay here again
she is professional attentive to her clients needs and very friendly
granted on our floor  someone was consistently smoking pot so im sure they were having a great time
overall everything was great and ill be coming again next time
i also reported that the internet was still down
earls club is way better in my opinion turkey bacon swiss lettuce tomato  sandwich sauce
i called hilton hotels because you cannot book that rate online
there is the deuce bus which is right outside of the resort and across the street which goes up and down the strip we took this many times when we couldnt walk
its much more quieter than staying anywhere on the strip
ive been here with the fianc but this time we came to eat here with the bachelorette group  very very limited buffet but they had crab legs and if you sign up for a card you get 3 off the buffet so it became 14ish being myself and asian i ate the expensive stuff first
i have been attending classes for a few months now and have already learned how to throw knives tomahawks and throwing stars shoot archery and use a variety of handheld weapons
am i being picky now
ive been to this place twice and both times were good experiences
the food is fresh and delicious along with amazing friendly service
the decor was nice but the wall paper was ugly
the wait was a tad long even for their sign our food is not precooked
my neighborhood chinese restaurant
i ordered classico pizza wings and a veal sandwich for take out
oh yeah i also subbed biscuits and gravy for my toast but i wouldnt recommend it
i got so many compliments on how good the food was
overall it was a horrible experience
the only complaint i have about the place is that the bed sheets in our room were not ironed and i noticed a lot of wrinkles
i saw the australian beegees too the last time and as great as that show was and i do recommend it watching that made me realize just how much goes into the production of david copperfields show
not here no friendly greeting when you arrive check in is very slow compared to all other hampton inns supervisor was aware of issue and did nothing cleaning service runs late
good food great patio and friendly service these are three daily dose highlights
dont stay here
i didnt add a single grain of salt or pepper because the flavor was so rich and perfect on its own
the pool was closed most of the businesses in the village were closed or shut down
it did not disappoint
so the rooms are cleanevery real hotel ive stayed at in vegas had a clean room
jai choisi le burger de chanvre je crois qu ce jour il reste le meilleur burger vgtarien que jai pu goter un vrai dlice
otherwise this would be a onestar review
staff was friendly and informative the restaurant brews starbucks coffee for breakfast and they have a large communal officeboarding pass printing area
food was pretty good but not as great as i expected
for everything associated with aria  great attention to detail
the pink taco is some of the best food we had in vegas
i would definitely recommend a best western over this location
lovely restaurant with friendly servers and good food
we decorated it ourselves brought in our own alcohol and hired an outside caterer
and the bill was add 15 tips dispite i disliked the food
she made me and my whole family feel welcomed  the receptionist was really nice too
we were exhausted from flying and the time difference and we just wanted to eat when we arrived at the hotel
i hope to take the intermediate class when i have time
not an appetizing sight people
there is a free shuttle that drops you off at either ballys or harrahs that runs until 1am
she opens the door and then manages to say housekeeping while shes already inside the room without our permission while were still laying in bed
they were well staffed so it was easy to find a seat at a table
i was impressed with the soup like every other yelp review states
the pool and hot tub was good and had great flexible hours opened early and closed late
plus they have a wonderful and unusual salad bar
from now on i believe my vegas days will be spent at the trump hotel
with all of the new hotels springing up that are oneuping each other wynn should focus on things that induce more customer loyalty and less shopping the latest and greatest
lets keep this simple great location bridges to bellagio ariacitycenter clean affordable look for online deals and still upscale
the staff is super nice except when you talk about the leafs and the sharks and the lobby is nice during check in
paris is perfactly located and for that reason i highly recomend staying there when in vegas
the poker room was average at best
our driver david was on time polite and courteous
these guys rock
i was very impressed with how detail oriented he was with making sure we all looked amazing
i think i wouldve enjoyed the fried plantains more but thats just personal preference
ok so its not totally authentic mexican
there is a lot of space inside which really surprised me when i saw the store front
just be aware that they might make you attend the timeshare presentation
i got a room with a king bed and as soon as i walked in i was in love
i am a member of ihg
ill keep it short and sweet the good  great hotel rooms some of the best in vegas because they are huge
the pool and jacuzzi are exquisite and huge
plantain chips were amazing
its reasonably easy to find
but the line cuts right in front of the entrance from the street so thats either poor planning or bad floor management
nearest one was near the screen doorkind of annoying
the almond cake was nice and warm and not too sweet
this is a brand new hotel located in downtown phoenix
staff are attentive and courteous
the first 2 days we were been arranged to stay at courtyard rooms which we didnt know the price were cheap but the room is small and it was a shower in the room
they left us a special treat of chocolates and berries for our anniversary which was a sweet surprise
however there are a few positives and martin picard amp company opening up their cabane  sucre is definitely one of them
it looks like downtown grand relies alot on triple george grill and the like just outside to really satisfy diners
so very fresh and lots of flavor
we heard the guys next door to us blasting 2chainz and rapping along with the lyrics
this weekend the elevators werent working very well there are no stairs to get down we ended up on emergency exit and we got lost
also it was very spicy
and then they pull the kids off the floor 15 minutes early because according to them it takes that long to give 6 kids gummy bears and a piece of paper
the golf itself was fun but we would not return to this venue
on weekends they turn it into a wet republicrehab place but on weekdays its a regular ol pool
thanks chris youre awesome
die schwbischen chefs  kerstin und alex sind sehr aufmerksam und allerliebst in ihrer natrlichen art  manchmal so richtig zum  k n u d d e l n  wenn  volles haus  ist muss man etwas warten dafr wirst du aber mit einem frischen essen belohnt dass ich mir jedesmal fast die f i n g e r abschlecke
you can cook in these rooms so someone must have cooked the dish and used the fan which only circulates in the room
the beds are outstandingi was so in love with the bed in our room
its not little italy in lower manhattan or the bronx but the foods great though not especially creative the service is fine and theres plenty of parking love the spaghetti and meatballs  generally ones enoughand i never share
i say its dinner because it was very filling they say its a light dinner the pressure of shower was nice and ohhhh water softener
he was very friendly and easy to talk too
way before check in time
love love love this place
customer service is non existent as no credit or solution was offered just an apology and a directive to make sure i tell them i need them hot for next timelike that is going to happen
as a tourist visiting for the weekend this hotel is very centrally located
the bad  the sandwiches are small
we had to get an engineer to snake them both
i adore the huge bathroom with marble floors and french double doors huge jacuzzi tub large stand up shower and the lovely vanity and stool for all of my beauty supplies which are key for my vegas transformation
each and every time we returned to our room we had get new keys
meet the owners  partners  we often say that food reflects personalities
we checked in the room was not ready so we left our luggage with the bell desk
they allowed us to check in early check in is usually at 4pm free of charge and we did it via mobile to avoid the long lines
shower in the room is a joke
full bar tvs and a great view of the city
bad attitudes and horrible service at almost every part of the resort
my girlfriend and i stayed at the plaza on our way to reno
my friends agree
mine was ok  overall i did not find the food to be all that spectacular
the prices are surprisingly good compared to other vegan places ive been to dont think anything was over 7 great spot for lunch cant wait to try some of their other things
sadly we got the raw end of the deal and ended up with a dry authoritarian
this is a chic hotel geared for younger crowds
the food and service was also superb
loved every second of it
sorry signature but youve just been served
how classy and thoughtful is that right
who doesnt love go karts a mini roller coaster riding down a giant slide on a sack and racing friends and family
not this one
penn is very clear everything in the show is just illusion and not magic and while i would hope most people actually realize that it is vegas so anything goes and for all i know maybe there was a harry potter convention in town and so they felt the need to make the point
service and checkout was a breeze
my company put me here and i guess they didnt know about this place but it was really close where i was going to work
since i didnt order alcohol she ask to see my id
there was only one exit
she was really rude which is a shame because the owner is a really cool guy
i later realized that this was the rehab high energy party pool
as a guest im suppose to know that if i want a decent room at this hotel i should ask for a renovated room
instead of talking to us politely the guy at the front desk told us  john is here for 3 years he would not tell you that
i stayed here with my boyfriend for valentines day weekend and we had a great experience
they smelled amazing as the smokey aroma filled my lungs
arcadia farms serves organic locally grown ingredients in all of its offerings
they framed the print i had chosen in a few minutes and my friends were absolutely delighted with their present
however if you are staying here expecting to make and quickly forget some bad choices probably not so much
we then were walked through stepbystep instructions on our artwork and during the night there was music laughter and good friends
they took my frickin idea
i went with my family and family friends and we were all not so impressed
one of my favorite hotels from the outside
this instance was the exact opposite
not a good experience staying here
im fairly mixed on the elara
nontgif foods were kinda blah
we stayed in their newest renovated tower overlooking the pool
we had a bottle of vodka some beer of my liking and champagne for our room
my only complaint was that the only indoor restaurant only allowed 21 and older
but we called at least three times the day of check in to make sure they didnt sell our reservation and not once did they mention the ac was broken
if the room is available dont nickle and dime your guests just let them check in early because they will probably spend that money at the slots or tables anyway
if youre in vegas make sure to visit rio and watch penn and teller you wont regret it
eine zentralere lage wre zwar schn gewesen aber wie gesagt ist die anbindung an die vp sehr gut und macht einiges wett
all wellseasoned freshtasting and delicious
but the pool is on the smaller side and a lot of people seem to be residents upstairs
the worst service i have ever experienced lazy rude and just didnt care
youll find it here
we waited in line over an hour to get into the bar up top  they kept telling us the private party was over soon and then we could go in  lies
we were coming here for my dads birthday and wanted him to show him what vegas was all about as he had not been there for 5 years
i grew up with this place and i am so happy that it has gotten better than i remember
since we stayed tuethurs we didnt encounter any of the noise that everyone keeps mentioning
i would recommend this place to anyone who really enjoys ribs
ill get off my soap box else i can ramble on about this topic
my hair goes everywhere when i dry it and by the fifth day when we left there was a lovely collection all over the bathroom
look the consol is nice and will be be nice till these newer non generic arenas start popping up then what
the wine list is extensive and theres a mezzanine bar and a cool whisky snug where you can enjoy a drink afterwards plus a cigar shack if thats your thing
i dont think this hotel is the best but i thought it was nice and cozy
vdara disappointed us from the get go
chef steve and carol were both very professional to deal with and everything went great
i came here for a conference so i cannot comment on the rooms or even the hotel staff
service is great from valet to managers
the rebels are still terrible and the stadium is subpar when compared to other college stadiums
the pool was nice never really crowded
the shop is quite small but has a cozy seating area
cant go wrong
we noticed since we sauntered in from the rain starving but were served promptly and even asked how the food was
other than that they delivered it within a good time frame
there were about 10 chairs around the pool available that you didnt have to pay to reserve
this place is deff bueatiful
we didnt have any leftovers after we were done since my boys loved it that much
it was great just the two of us
if only i wasnt allergic
the house salad with italian dressing and the linguini with white clam sauce is one of the best combos you will find this side of italia
a must try
they have great deals  rooms as low as 48 when you can get them
so we stayed for a few days and then it was time to check out
i ate as much of my chicken as i could but it was a little dry
and while the task of relating this truly epic cuisine hailing from the lone star state  the likes of which has produced some of the greatest dishes of all time namely breakfast tacos and queso  with fast food mexican outlets is a bit of a stretch my claim of burritoauthority lays therein
i had no issues with the process and was able to get through to them on the first and subsequent phone calls
booked two rooms and both of them leaked where theres the slanted window
i would not come back for lunch
love this place
weve been to smokeys a few times and each time i look to be wowed because everyone talks about it
we were then put on another floor with the view of the high roller
i swear i was just here last year during xmas and this wasnt here
this hotel was great not sure why others have such harsh words
this was our second time here for brunch
they are scheduled to open a wave machine flowrider later this year
guy in suit  i need to see your room key us  uh we havent checked in yet guy in suit  well you need a hotel key for free parking or we are going to charge you for parking alas we ended stopping by the valet temporarily to check in
would come back again if im in town
best place to shop
the girl was on her cell phone talking for 15 minutes while threading our eyebrows
the only thing in this concoction fried were the scrambled eggs
there are certain things i expect from a 50anight hotel like the three people randomly hanging out on the sidewalk around the back corner of the first floor cackling like hyenas at midnight for god only knows what reason
it is a bit off of the strip but it had shuttles readily available to take us to the strips throughout our stay
dont go by the reviews below about being scammed
walking into a hotel after a long evening in vegas after a long day working a trade show and being greeted by a pleasant smell and the blissful absence of slot machine dinging and blinking made the evenings wind down more pleasantly
overall if you want to look on how old vegas use to be back before there were casinos
it came with 2 perfectly cooked and seasoned eggs and one of the best quality white toast ive had
fine when does housekeeping begin
overall 45 stars which im gonna round up to 5
folks even recognized us when we came down the next day which was a sweet touch
we usually went to the pool after 530p and the lifeguard there was nice and seemed like a hardworking guy always folding towels and straightening lounge chairs
i hate the strip but at least there you might luck into a few bucks
they just dont sell flowers
the dancing was tip top and the performance was great
only complaint is there is no food service on premise
best part  the dueling pianos bar
it would cost me more in gas to drive down there then the 5 i would get back if they even did get it back
the upstairs has its own bar and food service area so its great for large groups
try a half killians and half blue moon
now im enjoying myself having a dinner at buca
the pool is tiny also and the patio out front is nice but needs more shade
second the breakfast restaurant in the hotel is very small and is beyond crowed every morning
or hardly any toppings for that matter
except for that well done with the renovation hyatt place
we had a large group set up in the back room to watch a friend of ours play music
so our room was very cute and in terms of looks alone i would give it 4 stars
i liked how they layered the different flavours so you could taste each flavour
overall i would not even waste your time here there are sooooo many more options on the strip then this place
so we spent our honeymoon at home
the fact they were able to have a tough conversation and make things right is all a customer can ask
this store is awesome and convenient for those staying at the main bellagio tower
this is unethical and price gouging at its worst
it wreaks of vanilla in all the walkways as of to cover up an odor
rooms are very dimly lit and towels with shredded edges
i saw the cleaning lady just walk right past it
rooms are super quiet no noise from outside can be heard in your room
im the kind of doofus who announces hes going to have a large dinner party before working out the details of how exactly im going to pull it off
even the bathrooms are nice
the chicken parmesan is not breaded and is sitting in a tasteless soup
our drinks were always full and plates cleared promptly
unremarkable fries that add little to the experience
ive even seen character thank you cards
location is great because it is close to everything
the place itself is quite large but divided up into smaller rooms  so it is great for an intimate dinner but also has room for large groups
imho the best sides are the ranch beans and the mac n cheese  but the st louis ribs are the reason to eat at bobbyq
the hotel is built on the cheap by standard mexican day laborers you know the quality of such construction
you need to call the bank yourself
the guy that checked our bags was so incredibly aggressively asking us for a tip for just holding our bags he insisted i go to an atm for what maybe 2 i would give him
ha but thats me being nitpicky and im coming from a place of love in that this place is too cool to be dragged down but silly servers
then add a cup of tomato soup
i enjoyed our stay last weekend
my room was ready even though i arrived before checkin
they had a very loud party all night long
they also were flexible in letting you rerequest your favorites and we didnt have to wait long for our requests to be fulfilled
it was hot and the crust was nice
5 the location was really bad and away from everything  6 food prices were way more expensive than other areas on the strip
but so often there are things that can be improved
however after our first cocktail waitress finished her shift we got a new girl who was not attentive at all
i think there were dusted onions whatever it was it added a nice crunch to each bite
no really theres proof in an incriminating photo of me kissing a bottle of the stuff
i am definitely going to put osheas in the vegas rotation next time i come back
great park if you live nearby fun parks nice astro pitch and bball court bit undermaintained though grass kept cut and 2 cycle paths coming out of two directions from it
preis  sehr gnstig fr stuttgart dazu auch noch mit frhstck
i sat down at a large tableits seat yourselfand it took a little time before the server or anyone approached me
kids not good for kids
stayed here for my best friends birthday
the squid ink pasta is in a spicy red tomato sauce which is too much for me
would never stay there again
majority of the food was still frozen there
we got the studio suite on the 29th floor and everything was so nice and clean
fremont is smack in the middle of oldfashion las vegas
it was hard for me to figure out how to get to this place
i had to go two floors to get some water
even if youre there for a convention id recommend getting a room somewhere else
my company has been coming here every single time we come to town for the con expo
it was sweet and spicy and a bit cheesy too
the pool area is decent
we loved the beautiful deluxe king roomcomfy bed beautiful bathroom with glass shower but the shower door didnt stay closed and rainfall shower head
she was very friendly and accommodating to our needs
never staying here again
i also liked the egyptian statues outside and inside
and everything was overpriced
i liked the score sports exhibit insideand i met a bass player for some metal band and took pics with him lol fun times
too much smoke in the casinos to just get to the elevator and to your room
they have a ton of experience and their classes are very enjoyable
way a great way to see the city
the forum shops have the best designed theme that flows perfectly with the hotel
we thought this might have been a mishap or miscounting of money or whatever but it was 40 per girl and that is a lot of money when each girl only brings about 100 cash total
they are located next to the phoenix outlets
the inside of the hotel leads to luscious flowers and water falls
no sweet and sour sauce for dipping for the egg rolls or sweet and sour chicken that was ordered
that was such a turn off
the service was very professional  wellcoordinated and timelyeveryone was very accommodating and welcoming
carpets are dirty empty bottle of wine in the fridge when i opened it for the first time the ac was not running when i checkedin so the room smelled musty  like beer was being fermented in the bathtub
i was surprised that the hotel actually offered a decent breakfast
loved the phones
we stood in a 15 minute line and were granted access to our room immediately
her personality was the same as cardboard
i get wifi all over cosmo and am not limited to just in my room as in most other casinos the marquee night club is the best night club in vegas and in some reviews best in the usa
beds are comfy and rooms are cozy
there was a great variety of brunchlunch items that made choosing difficult
the only down fall is now they charge their guests for parking
it were little chunks on all the plates knives and forks
had this for the first time tonight and oh man
dan fox took time out to chat with pam  i great attitude and great person whom we will be seeing many more times
this is why we selected it to host our sons 9th birthday party there this past weekend
just ate the best tasting brisket i have ever had
one complaint i have was the pool and gym hours i wish they were open earlier and later in the evening
there is a live band upstairs but we didnt bother to stick around for it
i had this place bookmarked forever but i never get up to this area so after a hike at mt
i personally had a good experience here
the room was literally the farthest away from the elevator that you could get
to get in   never again
you can request kitchen equipment through housekeeping if youd like
it frankly needs to be listed when your claim to fame on the strip is having the best pool area hands down and its closed
easily walkable to max  ermas restaurant
it starts out with a brief history of the architecture marvelous art collections and celebrity chefs
i only come here for he midway games
so dont expect the world and just have a good time
once you walk though the gate it feels like your in a real western town and some of the buildings have original pieces and even a few buildings shipped in from other towns
i cant even ask for any i opened the tortilla to discover dried up steak  that was it i pushed that aside and waited for the bartender to get back  so she comes back and ask if i needed anything else i looked down at the plate then back up to her and said just a check   she looked at my plate turned around and proceeded to bring me the check and asked if i wanted a box  are you kidding me
everything was clean and smelled fantastic
in the first room which was not ready at 11 am and was still being cleaned was not clean what so ever
first the coffee is always superb
i wish wed spent less on one of them  wont make that mistake again
came in around 630 on a friday night without reservations the staff was very sorry they couldnt give us a table  theyve been really  busy since the listing in the plain dealer came out
also have great service
call me at 1h30 minutes minimum tell me whats going onoffer to throw in a drink or a soup or a free delivery charge
f u holiday inn
and cosmopolitan hotel  casino is about a 67 minute walk away going outside down stairs or theres an elevator and walking across its giant circular valet drive but crossing some treacherous lanes of traffic also  not friendly to do but not really far per se
the bartenders are real no sloppy drinks here
its also super convenient open 24 hours so you can eat good food at any time and its easy on your probablyalreadylightwallet from playing too much paigow
do your self a favor and go
the animals are few and far between
the staff is nice but there are too few of them
worst part is there was an asian lady next to her that did not jump in to suggest anything
i really cant believe that the words out of his mouth were i will not do that for you
not to be missed
however it did stay on all day
prime location smack dab in the middle of the strip
could have not asked for a better place to get married
im already thinking about another photo shoot for my next birthday i want to try pinup girl
my favourite mexican restaurant in ontario
but my room in building 27 was awful
nannies  housekeepers were very patient with us
everything that was missing and then some was found in the buffet at the bellagio
the concierge cherie was so sweet and sent up six chocolatecovered strawberries with a happy anniversary card
my cousins plugged their phones into a different outlet and the phones were perfectly fine
i really enjoyed my stay at the new tropicana
i enjoyed the cheaperthanothercasino minimums and cheap drinks
not a good view but good enough for the price
a blintze is basically a cheesefilled crepe served with cherry andor blueberry compote
well done  encore pool attendants
i stayed here as a hotel and got a king bed really a double in american standards and a private room with a luxurious bathroom
ill definitely be coming here more often
otherwise go elsewhere
unsere kleine suite hatte ca 65 qm ein riesenbett ein separater wohnbereich gleich drei fernseher ppige minibar  wie alles hier relativ teuer bad mit dusche und wanne
you feel like you are in a james bond movie with the decor
i dont know what everyone is talking about i have had bad luck at this place every time
our room was pretty dated with respect to the interior
owner is very nice
the el cortez is what i like to call the passthur no one actually hangs out here we just park here because its free and its not too far from the downtown bars
and it isnt that i have anything against bachelorette parties
sorry just will wait to go back down south
went in after a workout to get a relatively healthy dinner of rotisserie chicken and salad
our experience was already great but i was impressed when he bought us an incredible desert just to say congratulations
my husband and i shared the toasted ravioli and calamari  both were cooked perfectly
ill start by sharing that i have had a positive experience with the staff the phone service center maintenance person who fixed my fridge and the staffer who quickly came up to give me new card keys after i asked to be moved to another room due to noise
the lounge area on fridays and saturdays is the place to be
good prices on home decor things lots of items to complete scrap booking and artsy projects
their willingness to adjust things to fit our personalities was really nice and unexpected as we were planning all this with mere days and hours before the ceremony
they handle the crowds very well and there are no scuffles over whos turn it is to play a game
this used to be my favorite place
prices also didnt seem super touristy or exorbitant
food was tremendous each time
in a weird way when i stepped into bills gamblin hall  saloon in las vegas i felt like i was walking into and starring in a contemporary western that replaced dim lights with neon flashing ones old ceiling fans with central air conditioning women in long ruffled dresses with women in short skin tight dresses and pints of beer with brightly colored cocktails
i mean at the end of the day its frozen yogurt and its still delicious so who cares but this location should aspire to do better
so yeah shady business practices on the promo side the manager was rude and lied said i was intoxicated
there is a place called lamonts where you can place bets on collegepro games horse racing etc
wasnt very helpful when i asked where the machine was she said its right there by your room gee thanx lady
but still that kind of adds to the charm and so i really dont have a problem with it
i would not even stay here for free
i am shocked and couldnt complain to their manager because they conveniently dont have one excalibur please do something about this employee or i can assure this story will be all over social media
cant go wrong with anything on the menu
1st disappointment of the trip but i get that her hands were tied
surprisingly it is listed at 360 calories im not sure if i believe that but one can hope
ive stayed in all of the nice hotels in vegas and had to check out the palazzo
bs im a seasoned business traveller and know they have communication and have had staff come in while im in and while im not in the room
definitely sticking with these ice pops for the summer
music was good but just techno beat and then after a while gets kinda old but it was still good
the side dishes are so good you need to be careful to save room for the meat
i should have kept true to my no seafood in land locked states rule
even the part of him finding some audience members father and reuniting them on the beach  saw it on tv
rather than hanging a do not disturb sign on the doorknob you indicate on a panel which is just inside the room if you want your room made up or not
ranch house salad my favorite type anywhere
our room wasnt ready when we went to check in so they sent us to the bar and were told to order what we want
the location is in the middle of the strip and the price on drinks range from 13
great magic laughs  an absolutely gorgeous assistant
oftentimes this place has a long line waiting to use them because of the volume of people
the service on this night was pretty attentive and the place gets bonus points for serving local craft beer exclusively
the clean midcentury design seems somewhat forced and not complete throughout the whole hotel particularly the landscaping
you can never stand over these lines even outback in this weird smoking area
crust is delicious
easy  fast
would not and will not ever stay here again
the hotel is clean staff is friendly and located next to westgate
i love the exposed kitchen and the light coming in from the windows
there were only 2 girls serving the crowded room but they both did what seemed to be an outstanding job
not day old
die tomaten und gurkendeko auf dem salat waren vermutlich schon lnger vorgeschnitten da die schnittkanten ausgetrocknet waren
the bathrooms were clean
gold coast casino has ping pang pong
will be back many times
free appetizer with yelp
they also have a frequent painter card
i love hobby lobby and for any of my craft needs ill return here
this of course  assumes your team is not a heart breaker
i made the initial order on  on the phone
staff are all friendly and courteous and the hotel itself has plenty of accommodations to make up kind of for the lack of casino
but bobby qs beef ribs were excellent
at least 4 people ahead of me paid for their food and it wasnt even ready for them yet which tells me that they ordered after i did
this marriott is in a great location if you have business in downtown charlotte and they have done a good job of keeping it up to date and providing value for the money
i really feel that a 5star resort should not charge you daily resort and internet usage fees  this should be incorporated into the price of your room when paying 200 a night
what a dump  out by itself and surrounded by empty dirt lots
my room was newly redone a tad smaller than the big chains but that added to the charm of the place
its a little bit pricier than aloha kitchen but the quality is much better
the food wine and service was great
i read other reviews that said the crepes are thick and tasteless
but we thought well check the elevator first
i do like the alligator or is it crocodile
but in the past i have appreciated the convenience and location to work
that could be fixed with a short nuke in the microwave but it didnt even need it
but the shower stall had only one soapdish to place your shower essentials meaning i had to put my bottles of toiletries on the floor which is not so convenient
beetroot risotto 2129 was delicious and perfect as a shared appetizer
i like the bar also
there is a small club in the casino that is low key
they also rotate their flavors regularly and i have never seen the flavors they serve here anywhere else
you can go on short hikes on the west side of the arb  wingra or you can hop on a bike and ride down to the main entrance of the arb exploring the trails and gardens
the cheapest rooms are on the vintage level right above the casino
its a story amongst stories
official races were held between our group where we had to react correctly to the flags thrown
so we spend a couple weeks getting those nailed down and send it back
i critique fine dinning and hotels i did eat at gordon ramsay steak wounderful food and excellent service i was lucky to get the two best people in the very nice restaurant michelle and joye excellent service i talked to the manager jenn hughes and told her how pleased i was with the service
sams town is where the older peoplelocals go and i must say i liked it way better than the strip
their options are vast and most sound delicious
3rd i dont think they outlined well enough what to do when you walk in
all of the food was delicious and there was a lot of it
the best dj company you could find in town
the bartenders were friendly and was eager to create their own shots for the guests to try and were extremely honest people we did not have someone supervising the front entrance and our guests had left their cash gifts on the bar top and the bartenders returned it immediately to my bridesmaid
vdara is for luxuriating so luxuriate
so when i set the alarm i had to set it for 12 minutes after the time i wanted to wake up
we had the street tacos and they were really good
the christmas party was held in the adobe room and as we walked in to the grounds of rawhide we were greeted by employees dresses in period western costumes and a roaring fire pit
im surprised this place is still open
to take over
it was still one there
i went with a group of girls right after finals and we really deserved an amazing meal and bouchon delivered
really super management model
the worst part will be trying to convince andy to stay at a marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on saturday
very central location for malls and eating places
questionably designed yesbut nice to be sure
the food is great
i love the food the environment and the owners are so personable
the view was just awesome
je vous avoue que ce fut une excellente entrevue et je suis certaine que le lieu eut un impact
c outside but i still brought a sweater and jacket to the conference because it was that cold inside
service parfait de tout point de vue de laccueil a la conciergerie les services  ltage sans parler du club sheraton au 37eme tage
all their sandwiches are pretty good on their menu my personal favorite is the the full montagu and the tomato soup best combo  the caprese is great also
the security guard is rude
their burritos are good their chips are extra crunchy if that matters to you
no hate for this place
totally what vegas is all about
kleenex boxes  obviously used since there was a water stain fluid stain that they did not bother to just throw away and make it more aesthetically pleasing
this morning i called to have a latte delivered to my room and they explained that room service does not have a latte in the menu
last night my phone rang
stayed here for a couple of nights and was impressed
the owner came to our table at the end of the meal to thank us and gave us each a boxed italian cake and a small glass of dessert wine as christmas gift
there were so many issues with our meal it is hard to know where to begin
overall  its a ok place to stop if you are not looking for top notch service with a smile and just want a bowl of warm gumbo to warm your spirit instead
heres where it gets interesting
bread please with sauce ooooooooooooh the smell of garlic and spices
fries were perfect and they give you a heaping pile of them so you wont  go hungry
most likely because i booked via a third party website they ended up giving me a corner disability room which had a king bed and supposedly was the only one with a king bed at checkin
the appetizers are generous portions and great tasting with several selections to choose from
their videography crew are also wonderful
being that im currently pregnant i ordered a nonalcoholic cocktail pineapple mule
buttons missing buttons that as you left the ground floor they would go blank and would have to be pushed multiple times to reach your floor
some of the best steak ive had in my life
we ordered bottle service for my friends bachelorette party
i walk in around noon and the waiting area is packed as it was last week
worked like a charm
we called down but had to wait almost 12 an hour for new ones to be brought up
when we got to the room we just put them in their proper bags they came with and then inside a shopping bag and left them on the couch knowing we wouldnt need again until we flew home
it was a mai tai
the staff was helpful in recommending cuts
we contemplate staying because she was so nice and helpful
his love for animals and people makes the photo shoot fun and relaxing
when it arrived i was puzzled
the hotel rooms are small but comfortable
lines were no problem with shaun otherwise we would have waited over 2 hours
but there are plenty of restaurants in the area you can grab a good drink at first before you head over
they are fresh pickled and tangy awesomeness
the rooms are moderately priced cozy and warm the hotel is pet friendly and the parking in the back is convenient and free
there could have been more meat on the sandwich to balance the level of spreads
leider hat eine gruppe die ganze veranstaltung erheblich gestrt mit unkompetentem und unfelxiblem verhalten
i prefer a thinner filet of fish so i get the crispness rather than the softness when getting into the meat of the filet
fun good payouts bose sound system in the chair
great food and all the champagne or mimosa that you want
it started with the host telling us that the patio was closed even though we called at 330 earlier to verify we could have patio seating at 730 did i mention that it is march in phoenix and 75 degrees
this is a very simple but elegant casino
i would highly recommend epic game trailer for any partyoccasion
we stopped by cleveland specifically to visit the hall
we hired him to play at my beach party and it was off the hook
get it together
the price this year was a little high too but its all going to a good cause
seriously gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isnt going down the drain after someone showers
we checked around and most places were booked solid
after dinner i was pleasantly surprised to find that they had gluten free desserts which again were to die for
the temporary trailer is a bit of distraction to the incredible garden that awaits
we hired nancy kartoon for our daughters birthday party and she was a big hit
thank you blossom basket for a job well done
if you dont like rock and arent into memorabilia what in the world are you doing here
the room spacious and comfortable with good ac very important in phoenix
will be back for sure
quiet inner sanctum in the midst of bustling downtown cleveland
we got to our room and it was just a king
long hair does care because it takes forever when the water pressure is horrible
this was the time we found out that they offer drink credits and since the room cost 150 we were entitled to 150 in drinks
our server next greeted us
i went on tuesday and enjoyed it so much i went back on thursday too
parking was easy but it was 10 a day
they used real fish to decorate empty bowls hanging from the ceiling
as long as you have a car its a good place to stay since its off the strip
downtown las vegas tour this walking tour doesnt just provide plenty of food but gourmet edibles at some of the nicest and trendiest establishments that have opened up in downtown las vegas
my spa treatment made up for the beigeness of the space by being absolute fantastic and restful with largerthanaverage rooms
the pita bread itself my inlaws assure was traditional
they have no idea what the elara is or where it is located
have stayed in a one and two bedroom now
wow this place is sooo amazing
like velcro sticker strips  phone stands some tools  shoe racks  grippers  sticky hooks
i indulged in a croque monsieur basically a french toast sandwich with ham and cheese served with fruit salad and sweetened cream or maple syrup
staff is very nice  accomadating
i guess its more normal than i thought
to my dismay the hotel is still in very good shape very clean and still very appealing
oh and i highly recommend upgrading to the hd live you get better pictures
just not friendly at all
in and out in less than 5 minutes
if i could provide an even lower ranking for this hotel other than terrible i would
id be curious to come back on a normal day to see if the quality is any different
my room didnt have great water pressure and other guests were loud from time to time but the first thing is luck of the draw and the secondas long as it doesnt last isnt a shocker
they charge you 1000 deposit on a room key when i tried to return the key there was nobody at the front desk they didnt answer the phone when i called and they did not answer the repeated loud knocks at their door
that place cost about 80 more and the ac was still not very quiet but the hotel was quiet and i turned off the ac and surprisingly wasnt hot
i wish i knew those mosquito like bites are bedbug bites
they have a cafe next to the checkinout counter if you get hungry while in the waiting room   they offer a free shuttle service to pickup  dropoff at your hotel niko was my driver  he was also awesome  he is also a range officeremployee  very knowledgeable about all my questions on firearms
the room though
as a diamond member my girl friend and i were upgraded to a twostory loft
that is around 60 people who didnt speak english well
maybe not mavericks fault
i definitely wouldnt stay here again
mold in shower to start with then grandfather of owner pounding on our door in the morning despite the do not disturb sign wanting to know if we were checking out later that day if we werent we are nownever again
i circled the entire building twice
pros host stephen was very helpful and even called my room after a small snafu to make sure everything had been taken care of
he is patient kind and very funny with the kids
i guess the only thing i didnt like about the hotel scheme was the black wall paper they put on each floor
tiefgarage direkt zugnglich frhstck reichhaltig und zentral in vaihingen mittel etlichen mglichkeitenwie restaurants u einkaufgalerie
did not care for the timeshare sell i expect to see that crap all over the strip but not in a fishing joint
breakfast buffett lobby soft drinks all done right
but yeah definitely the best ribs in vegas
it came with a 32 lcd tv a single seat couch and a small table
decorambience is really great in this hotel
at this point i was so furious about her total disregard for a customer that i had to take pictures of the lanes to show just how ridiculous it was for me to be waiting for so long
definitely has the hip urban vibe that i really enjoy and the location is on the strip is ideal for me
i big let down for us and wont be back
there was no offer to compensate for our experience
not usually looking for italian especially for lunch but what a nice friday afternoon surprise
my boyfriend and i are definitely going back
hotel was clean and quiet
its whats makes it beautiful and great
the chicken is absolutely amazing but as mentioned in many other comments the kitchen can be ridiculously slow
there overflow drain on the tub was crooked and there was alarge gap looking in to the pipe
celebrity tux and tails did a great job for me my groomsmen and my two boys
by the end of meal my mouth felt so buttery that i had to put some soap on my mouth to get all the oil off from me
coffee was very good as well
the brisket was very tender and moist and the mac n cheese is heavenly  you definitely get what you pay for and our waitress nicole was a sweetheart and took very good care of us as did the rest of the staff who checked on us periodically asking how everything was
also no water glasses or cups were provided and i had to go asking for them
we arrived to checkin at about 430pm well after the 3pm checkin period
i really wanted to like this place
help to put it out of its misery by not giving it any of your money
the pool is a great place to hang out and meet new people the music is trendy with good remixes and the servers are very attentive
but it was a really huge amount of food
unless you want to valet your car you have to park in the parking garage on the other side of the hotel
xs club is my favorite
but not bad
but i recommend anyone take a look at this
the room may not be as big as say the embassy suites but ive liked the cleanliness of the hilton garden rooms better than some of the bigger hotel chains
we didnt attend but it was nice to be immersed in the whole race culture and atmosphere even at the hotel
turkey club and muffalatta
from other reviews i read i guess you can pay extra for the utensils or bring your own
it goes out for hours and the hotel cant help you with it because its through att
but the fish was cold the salad was warm the minestrone soup was not only cold but mushy and burnt like it gets when you scrape it up from the bottom of the pot after its been sitting too long
thank you all for being trustworthy and honest
i went for my friends bachelor party and we all had a great time
i expect three things out of a hotel stay  comfort quality food and service
the pastrami is the best i have ever had and i cant wait to go back and have another
if i was able to give 0 stars i would
what was the point to call security
i decided to call front desk instead from the room
bad mistake as it already looks dirty
i usually make horrible choices when i pick hotels
our unit was equipped with a cdaux player a dvdblueray player a washerdryer combination and more
3 hours later i returned to my room
for the next 6 months sarah could not figure out how to charge the credit card i gave her the correct amount
this might be the most luxurious hotel ive ever stayed in
hotel was clean
the ribs are fall off the bone tender and have a mildly smokey flavor
they did comp two nights of resort fees but regardless that is the worst thing that could happen at a hotel
another amazing night here tonight
the good things about the hotel were the lobby the roomservice reasonable prices and delicious food and the free shuttle service
these rooms are beyond a great value
for example for lunch you basically have sliced turkey bbq chopped brisket or bbq pulled pork
oh and they take apple pay too and thats a plus in my book
the crown jewel of this place tho is not the room or the bed which i would go back for anyway
older gentleman if i can even call him a gentleman in his 50s greater than six feet tall and grey hair
however masters has been growing on me
close from the strip and the mall
even if you dont order any alcoholic beverages
they were efficient courteous professional and very helpful
die rechnung war trotz sonderwnschen angenehm preiswert
i was taken back at this
theres also other fees such as socan fee security fee and a bunch of other stuff
refrigerators in every room would be nice too and that would be an issue if i ever paid full price for the room but one can hardly complain when the room is clean spacious well appointed and ridiculously cheap
yes the convenience of the convention center is great but thats about it
overall though our experience was great and i would recommend and return to the flamingo
drove all the way from cave creek for my bday and totally disappointed myself and my guests who also celebrated a bday
it was st patricks day it was starting to get dark and i was very hungry
unfortunately the taste was a little bland
and if you are a bit skittish of certain areas do not stay in the manor section
one member of our party ordered a coke and it was totally flat
5 stars indeed
my mom had that dish
as good as it gets
not recommended anymore just a simple cheap italian hot plate restaurant very little seating and whatever seating that is available outside is absolutely filthy
5 stars on breakfast
the fat on every piece of meat is an excellent way to throw a party in your mouth
so much beautiful calligraphy decor
i cannot believe that it took me this long to try john mulls
went their for a wedding and thoroughly enjoyed myself
also picked up 4 plastic cups from the bottom of the pool
when we checked in they gave us a room with 2 twin beds
first impression of this pace bland
never a dull moment very exciting action packed
never a wait  i usually call ahead of time how ever very friendly staff and fresh food what more could you ask
do not stay here
i do the happy dance when i know im going to the pond  gvr this place is amazing i think my bestie ebony for introducing me to this place
the location is convenient with the miracle mile shops at planet hollywood across the street
20 for a full size bar
i ordered the kung pao chickenit was awful
on one hand its nice because it is a quiet walk and it seems very private since you are so far away from the hustle and bustle of the casino but on the other hand sometimes you just want to be close to everything
why would the front desk check us into a room that was not even ready
in the other we had a full sized kitchen with top appliances a huge l shaped couch 2 bathrooms one being the size of some hotel rooms on the strip another king sized bed and floor to ceiling windows in both rooms
unfortunately upstairs was decidedly more casual loud and touristy
the spa also has its own parking lot at the back of the property making it very convenient for locals
we asked for a dental kit  not only did it arrived in a mere 5 minutes but someone even called to double check it arrived  nice touch
being that this place is on the south mountain side of phoenix near where we were staying with not one other place around us that yelpers recommended we knew this would be on our to do list for our trip
i wanted to try the original 1762 but i asked one of the workers which one he would recommend he suggested the holiday special
one thing to note is that the thing that makes this las vegas strip property unique is the actual exterior itself
we were on the 21st floor which gave us a beautiful view of the mountains and strip
very nice all around
full of flavor though
german beer by its nature typically mellows the hell out after three or four sips but not this stuff
then i got a shot of half her face and that was it
she sent the manager over and they did compensate us for his meal which they didnt have to do
i cant speak to the gambling cause thats not my thing
long story short worse service ive ever received
the process seemed a little lengthy
the location is great walking to tons of little restaurants and coffee shops as well as a short walk to the castle and royal mile
2 they dont tell you about the 200 deposit they take from your credit card and hold until after you leave
giving false hope when youre starving is just plain wrong
and i dont recall ever having any food there that was less than outstanding
if you go someplace like the cosmopolitan or venetian you dont constantly inhale cigarette smoke and you dont go back to your room wreaking of it either
it should be treated with the same delicacy as a painting for the reason that just as much work goes into it if not more its value is gauged based on the quality of materials used the machinery used to create them and the personal attention devoted to its creation versus simply being done by machine alone
he informed me that the broken elevator is going to be replaced as soon as they can get it done
the food was great the atmosphere was very nice and our servers were very attentive in making sure we had all we needed
prices are great
i asked him why i was having so many problems and he told me the service provided sucks
they provide the helmets and intensive safety reviews
they served chicken carne asada and pork carnitas tacos with warm shells and the most amazing homemade salsas and guac for toppings
i love the cosmopolitan
dont touch any of the goodies or alcohol in the room unless you want to get charged an arm and a leg
the remaining entrees were fantastic
however we were close enough to access everything within a 10 minute taxi drove including the outlet mall
server was excellent and the queso dip is amazing
and if you request for a table to be cleaned be prepared to get nothing but attitude from the staff
not very high quality
the pool is fairly large ameba shaped pool with quality chaise loungers
many good things have been written about the wynn and i dont want to repeat them here
great staff and nice place
ahhh   the room  stayed in a room in building 16 with views of camelback mountain
each side was 225 which is entirely fair
brought my niece here was excited from the description on the website but i wasnt as able to play with her as i would have liked
i missed having a parlor or other public area to hang out in if we wanted to be somewhere other than our room but other than the garden there was no regularly available common area
1 im all about customer service and they are definitely not up to par especially gabriel from operator
this is a good place to gamble and drink no decent clubs or lounges in here
rooms were nice very clean and comfy beds
location wise it is very convenient
im super late doing this review but here we go my group purchased tickets for the pub crawl and of course we were late but i believe it was andrew i dont remember his name but he was a sweet cutie was really cool  we met up with the group at  the foundation room as they were getting ready to head over to mix
im tired of the neighbors in the next room being loud and partying i already have filed 3 complaints in 2 nights and staff doesnt seem to care that these kids are smoking pot in the room and we can smell it through the vents not cool
however that all changed last saturday night
everything was fabulous
this is a marriott property and the decor is very modern and clean
my fiance had the chicken fettuccine  the cream sauce tasted like butter
i picked a little treat and was happy
another cool thing about this place is their courtesy shuttle service where i wanted to go for the night was out of their driving range but if they dont need to take anyone else out and you tip handsomely theyre willing to do it
i used to really love the mgm for their awesome pools and lazy river good food and roomsnot so much any more
the buffet had a decent selection of the usual suspects and the quality was all average or better
quick to answer all of our questions and direct us without even having to meet face to face
the hotel is very difficult to get into so getting out was okay but finding our way back was a huge pain
and the foooood
got a massage when visiting from out of town
i did not enjoy my stay here
we really loved the atmosphere as well
everyone sang happy birthday and she even got a dessert to enjoy
all in all a great little gem
i spent about 15 minutes at front desk trying to check in
both of them were so patient with our time changes  super understanding of the groups needs
i told the lady that i could have 100 rooms but its still miserable if theyre cold and have no hot water either
when there are so many wonderful places to stay in vegas with excellent customer service why stay at trump
and in addition you didnt have to keep saying stuff like i cant even stand there with my eyes wandering around
the atmosphere was pleasant and the food was tasty and filling
eh the person who took our to go order was nice and its decent pricedfor that a 3 but my sauce on my raviolis was just bland maybe out a can with no seasoning i paid extra for meatballs and got two small ones
the location is fine
this isnt the best place to stay at and that should be a given as it is in the middle of nowhere and much cheaper than most anywhere else out here especially given the extra space and the full kitchen where everything actually works
the rooms are tiny much smaller than other extended stays i have been at in the past
the pool is heated
fab and even more fun only one person accidentally went into the pool
overall i highly recommend them
there are two great looking pools to enjoy but i cant review here as the weather was too cold for me to get in there
the view is awesome and i loved their alarm clock
because theyre near the airport youll hear plane noise duh but i didnt find it to be a problem
the ingredients are all fresh and the service is fast
this is my 1st time watching the show live
i have never tried anything there i didnt enjoy
next room had bedbugs
theres a salad bar with pizza and another buffet with pasta 6 different pasta sauces chicken veggies all kinds of choices
will definitely stay here again  very much improved from a stay a few years ago
although i really dont like the mgm grand as a casino i really liked this theatre as a venue
i recommend everyone swing by this place and give it a whirl
nette und freundliche bedienungen sehr gutes essen und eine angenehme atmosphre
wow what happened to this place
reason being is that the drive thru traffic is insane and you could get blocked in or stuck in the traffic
it seemed like the staff at the rio was working double time to get everyone checked in and moving onto their rooms
between the mushrooms and truffle oil the omelet should have been oozing with an umami flavor
per tradition they allowed me to take a photo on the grand staircase which greats you upon your arrival in my favorite dress
once i walked in i was in awe
management was extremely insensitive as the female manager attempted to reassure me that they take the proper procedures to rid their hotel of bed bugs but never once apologized to me she was more concerned with highlighting the hotels procedures which were not followed properly obviously
they were not helpful nor truthful
while i was napping the mr took the opportunity to order some dinner for us
it takes about 10 minutes to walk from here to the strip simply because there is not a direct route so you have to walk down a bit and then over
some info  this place is clean and love their setup
theres no casino and its quiet
there was a model train running on a ledge above the restaurant which was interesting to watch
food poor starbucks good and close
i have to stay everything worked out perfectly
great food super amazing customer service great deals on drinks in game day and super friendly
our room was huge
like other viewers wrote menu is very limited and i actually wanted crepes but they didnt have it
i prefer firmer beds and more substantial feather pillows
you see im lactose intolerant so cows milk is a no for me
seasoning very tasteful
upon my friend going to pick up her bag she was told they didnt have anything at the front desk
my wife and i had the pleasure of having our wedding ceremony at the chapels at the bellagio in 2005 worldclass service in every possible way
the bathroom seemed a bit small for me but it sufficed it was only one night mind you
will bring my hungry teenagers here next time they ask for chipotle
the casino is very inviting spacious and brightly lit
nothing beats island flavor here in vegas
it all comes down to taste
oh yeah and breakfast is not included like at some other hotels like holiday inn express
i thoroughly enjoyed this house especially because i absolutely love that particular illustration
by the end of the day my girlfriend and i were exhausted but in full agreement that this experience was one of the best we have had while traveling
makes me so mad we invested like over 85000 into all the charms
this place is located in planet hollywood in near the shops and casino
the lady at the front desk was really nice so props to her for not losing her cool with me because i was super mean
after all how much nonsleeping time am i going to be spending in my room
before going into everything i loved about the hotel this is not the property for you if you are looking forhave to have  secondhand smoke greeting you as you walk in the door sorry this just isnt the place for you then
no trip in vegas is complete without a stop here
its not the usual sandwiches or pastapizza or chinese etc
this was worth every penny and was definitely the highlight of our trip
dinner included the veal piccata with capers and lemon sauce
not surprisingly it was very busy again too
the banquet crew kept several of my decor items
i recommend to visit this place at least once to see beautiful panorama of vegas
we were trying to make it on time to their cirque du soliel show the beatles  love and just didnt have as much time to look around
wifi in the room did not work bathroom was subpar compared to other hotels on the strip but the beds were clean
all in all my favorite thai restaurant for finedining
for dessert they were so sweet they brought us desserts on the house for our troubles
also if you are marriott rewards platinum or gold they include the buffet breakfast or your al a carte breakfast order in the price of the room sunsat most marriotts its only mf
i suggested he say to the new management we can do better
i wish i wouldve gotten more because it was a great combo
i was coming back on deployment from the middle east on rr
it looked like a fairy tale
by the time he got done checking 3 of our party in it was a little after 4 pm
some very kool bars and lounges and an awesome sports book
the only thing that happened was the monte carlo now has a mark against them in my book and it took me an extra 5 minutes to get to hoover dam
ill actually eat all the biscuits
rooms are great perfect size for a short trip
let me just say i have been to vegas many times and i have used vip services and have never had such a good experience from beginning to end until i used red carpet vip
the casino itself is fun with lots of things to do and look at
i hate the smell of cigarette smoke but walking thru their casino was pretty bearable even with plenty of smokers sucking on their cancer sticks was on every table
the tiny underground parking lot is the one area that still desperately requires renovationwork
we decided to leave the preservation and eat somewhere else
this is definitely the kind of place where the service improves if you are a regular
she worked hard for this tickets
the hotel staff was welcoming  check inout was a breeze and the meals served were overall excellent a lot of chicken  but everybody likes chicken so what are you going to do
and uhh yay free cookies
hard for me to think of a reason to stay here
it is quite small inside only 6 or 7 tables and 2 outside with an eclectic decor
not sure whats happening at this location lately
the pool is nice and long enough to swim laps
just the max limit of your car
sehr schn schliesslich will man ja auch mal stosslften und ist nicht suizidgefhrdet
great steaks great drinks and excellent service
my dinner was actually really good but id add some additional selections
the bellman suggested i call down to the front desk so i did to get it sorted out
they had only one packet of coffee creamer tea shampoo conditioner etc  in the room even though the room is obviously made for two
the front desk staff has excellent customer service skills
this felt like a full out event
the southern nevada health dept website indicated there are reports of the norovirus in las vegas
rooms are clean
both came out piping hot which was refreshing because most of the time you cant see steam from your food at that hour 1 am
im not sure but he does have potential
i have always wanted to stay at the bellagio
you or him
the lunch menu isnt long but the choices looked appealing in every section offered
very friendly staff
the lemon tart was not so great
it shares space with the spa which together is named the health and beauty center which made it difficult at first to know whether that was just a spa or included a gym
negatives  the awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement
their sauces are awesome
if possible ask for a tour of the restaurant or schedule an experience at the chefs table
this hotel offers a balance between being downtown  paying big time bucks and being out of the action  getting it on the cheap
i cant wait to stay here again
i kept my cool and informed her the wedding was on may 4th
the vip check in clerk was completely incompetent
our room was pretty standard
put our bags down that was all good
you also get a fridge dishwasher stove and platescups
ive updated my review after receiving a very kind call from the hotel that proved customer service is so important to them
i liked that there were 2 bathrooms and a kitchen plus a fireplace and an awesome view of the strip from the balcony
in the bathroom mirror 9 morning newspaper 10 complimentary dropoff to and pickup from ceaser palace and wynn 12 at a 5 to 15 min walking distance from wynn encore ti mirage venetian yet a little off from the noise smelly and smokey strip hustle and bustle
the rooms are well furnished but there are two big problems with these rooms that maybe only applied to our situation
while i am sad i did not have the time to attend rehab i loved being able to rock out in the comfort of my own room to the djs that were playing and for the weekend i was there i was excited that it was two djs that knew how to get the party started
at this point i was already getting full from all the chips
i stayed here the last weekend in june 2013 i used to live in the phoenixtempe area so i am some what familiar with my surroundings here
the hotel room was excellent with all the amenities
great place to go bowling with a group of friends
its almost as though all they did was put in a new mirror  faucets
or the hotel in case you keep taking shots
this is our fourth trip here and so far its ok   happy hours ends way to early and now we cant see the outdoor movie because its no money in the pool area and they wont let chairs in the area where rhett movie is showing
but my overall experience was great
850 a shot for patron
friendly staff the server suggested me things and gave me ideas and described the menu
location cant be beat with the monorail station a short walk from the lobby area and two pedestrian bridges to connect the hotel to the nyny and excalibur
very good for passport photos
you either have a choice of rooms odd numbered ones with stunning views overlooking the castle but equally astounding sounds of the weekend on grassmarket
being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels you would think they would try to up their amenities a little
sign me up
i was then passed onto the manager of accounting maria luciano
clean and the desk staff was nice
for me the room is simply a place to lay my head and take a shower
great place great location and the towels were so fluffy i could barely get my suitcase closed
probably my favorite place to grab a coffee in town
then it changed to 2 minimum with 50x odds
up until about 4 years ago it was the greatest place to eat
my sister and i have date night here about once a month
hitting some of the scottsdale nightlife
sounds good right
there are many tables available to grab a coffee and readstudywhatever you want
to finish us off  complimentary mini donuts yes you heard me right
the stromboli was also great
great if you have kids or want to go wild and be loud without others caring but not so great if you want to be able to use the pool and sleep without a room full of screaming kids next to you
thats great customer service as a server and a manager in a restaurant i know how important that is
highly recommend everyone to go to this place
my first room had a mildewed shower and faulty ac
there is a very distinct musty odor mixed with a smokey smell as if this used to be a smoking facility
he said that a refund was sent in the mail which we never received
the photos turned out great and were provided in a timely manner we received an initial batch of teaser photos within a couple weeks then the complete fully enhanced set with in a month and a half
there was also a pro driver on hand to take us around for laps in a different porsche too
the music was the same dancerap music that all the clubs and hip casinos on the strip seem to play now
also there was no refrigerator lame
as far as the food goes  its overpriced and not notably delicious
alsoi love that they have iced green tea that isnt sweetened
when every hotel on the strip was booked solid on 4th of july because someone decided she might want to spend the night as she was passing through super 8 motel had one room left with a big sign that read no pets  but they gave it to me and my pet anyway
this hotel is brown brick
but overall if i ever return to vegas id seek out this earl of sandwich for a fairly fast relatively inexpensive casual meal
i know im mean
had my baby sisters wedding here  the garden chapel
its kind of more modern definitely not your traditional mexican restraurant
we never wanted to leave
as far as the veal it was not tough cooked right and good flavor
the photographer even took pictures with our phone so we can use them right away for social media that day
they insisted on full price and had no remorse
service is great
we have been this establishment as a thanksgiving tradition for 7 years now between the scottsdale location and seattle
they also bring in a wide variety of acts which is nice
i found the casino just right dim and relaxing with a variety of tables slots video and other machines
ive stayed at candlewood suites before and theyre generally small clean no frills studio rooms and this one is no exception
the customer serviceconcierge workers were rude unhelpful and nasty
had a bit doubt when i heard it the first time
interesting casino i guess this is the new style of casinos in las vegas
my husband and i just spent our honeymoon here in a jacuzzi suite
weve seen this show twice once in 2011 and again in 2014 i go with a friend who loves the beegees too and my husband who is a good sport
five minutes later it came out  a small sandwich  with 7 chips  for 1650 tax in
we had a great time in a great space
it is on the edge of the university area with nothing to do within walking distance
my pregnant wife left crying about the customer service from this location
die zimmer sind unterschiedlich
the penn  teller theater was generally smaller than i expected much more intimate but definitely suggest getting floor seats and main seating to vip front seats to get a great view and more personal sense in watching the show
after the third request to redo the server got pissed at the chef then the chef just threw tantrums and left the kitchen
taunted me by laughing in my face and being sarcastic to me
the reason i am giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 is because the vibe is really cool
it was delicious
i tried a bag of their bbq chips and they were a little too strong on the msg side of things
now those are soft pretzels
there was nothing in the town to really do but it was close to the city
i stayed here for 12 weeks over the summer
when they saw my room everyone wanted to move to my hotel also because of the location
yes the rooms get cleaned but there is a lot they dont do that other hotels do
the big advantage of this place is that it is located in an excellent location on the strip is open 24 hours a day and the prices are reasonable considering where it is located
a better option grab and go from fortuna plus its open 24hours
we waited a bit  for our reservation
lots of spaces free valet interesting shop delicious food lots of space
i also wish they had an option where you can pay by the hour instead of for all day
somone took the moon idea too far
i am a marriott rewards member and have to say that i got better service staying at a fairfield
the best bang for your buck no doubt
i came on here one day before my 3day stay that just completed earlier today
the food is very fresh
across the street is a nice shopping center with a grocery store and a few eateries
thats when i demanded that the manager and i needed a talk
im not a big fan of fish but my friends said the salmon and swordfish were good
so i say yes i have an id
first of all when we inputed the address provided on the booking to our gps it took us to a different hilton ok so we reroutedanother wrong hiltonand again it took not one two but three tries to get it right and this was with the staff directing us
they answered every email quickly and handled everything for me
this is our second time here and although our two boys were excited there were aspects i was less than thrilled with
we werent looking for noise so we sat at the very far left near the hot tubactual pool and far away from the wave pool
soneedless to say my family and i wont be supporting this business anymore
i have stayed at many different strip hotels and this is by far my worst ever experience
your pull pork sliders combo free to any veterans are appreciated
she also said there was nothing she could do and sent me to risk management
to make this place even better youll also find king of pops right outside with their delicious popsicles
its spicy and goes great in burritos or on nachos
since yelpers mentioned that the palazzo is very similar that may be our next hotel when we return to lv
dear arleen a while the food was great i am very disappointed at your service
and the toilet paper that was on the roll was 34 used
they have also dampened the sound problem that stars always suffered from
i found this hotel based off the the amenities and affordability
rooms were nice and decent size
if you want a miserable overpriced aggravating disgusting experience  then by all means go to the sls las vegas
the saga continues during check out i reminded the lady at the front desk that so and so i forgot his name now had comped half a nights stay
its the ultimate comfort food and they have the most friendly owners perfect for a rough day
i took a star away because of the valet service
seul bmol au repas mon micuit tait trop cuit
3 its a lot more fun if you have a sense of humor about the ridiculously lowtech light show surrounding merlin at the entrance the dimly lit rooms and the tapestries on the walls
the mountain views were phenomenal
marriage is fine too but you have to pay for a minister because elvis is elvis not a minister
yes chocolate waterfall i will do your bidding
when i asked for extra towels i would just reuse my old ones and took them the fresh ones
i come here to ride the rollercoaster and play the arcade games when i am in las vegas
the club house and locker rooms are great and the course looks awesome
my daughter had the italian french toast that is coated with captain crunch
my girlfriend and i bought these for the weekend and they are a must if you want the best bang for your buck
what can i saybrett is amazing
they are always intertwined
my crunchy shrimp caesar was a nice portion size and a creative spin on a great traditional salad
the bride and groom dressing rooms were very nice but bare
you also have a 247 starbucks
our table was reserved and ready when we arrived on a busy weekendsold out status and we were a large group of 22 our servers were quick listened to special requests didnt miss a beat
i could tell the guy was upset at our guest but tries to hold it in
it has two showerheads so the water is blasting and heats up easily
i tried to catch some sun before i had to head out for the day
plus with the park ducks and lake you just cant lose
the closet light kep going on and i eventually wedged a shoe against the door to keep it closed
nervig ist auch das selbstbedienungsprinzip an der minibar noch nicht mal eine flasche wasser war im zimmer
youtube type streaming videos had to load for awhile before they would start playing
the bbq sauce was above average and tasted homemade or close to
eat drink and be merry my friendsjust not at this chickfila
problem is they called my company on a saturday were off and no one answered because no one was there
while relaxing you could hear the subway train rumble by whirl pool and sauna at the back of the change room there is a small whirl pool a dry sauna and a wet sauna
we were in line at 1030 how early do you want people to come
food was good  standard pub fare
i couldnt have asked for a better wedding
after about 1020 minutes of wandering around we eventually found our rooms
police say they are investigating whether the shooting was an act of selfdefense
a bit later peter the gm came up and thanked us for coming in and wanted our feedback
you could comfortably fit 6 people in these rooms
honestly it was a bit soggy for my taste
the sportsbook was pretty cool too
we stayed here six days
and reasonably priced imo
there is a breakfast place and some other restaurants in ti itself but super pricey even by vegas standards so wait and see where you really want to spend your money
to me thats sincere quality customer service
the portionprice ratio seems to be pretty fair which is always a good thing
the dipping sauce was really quite good
most the time it is a bit tight with our 2 dogs on a busy weekend but today sunday we arrived at 7 am and had the patio to ourselves
edit from 92815  someone from this hotel either used our credit card or sold the credit card info
long line but my friends came ahead of us so we zipped in front sorry to the people behind us
hooked us up with free shots
i was here for the justin timberlake world tour and i thought it was a good smallintimate venue
i remember coming here as a kid with my parents and never liking it
prices are reasonable and its nice supporting a small place in the neighborhood
from our experience there is nothing here to draw us back
the jambalaya is a meal on its own and well worth the adventure
your feet will thank you later
stayed at this hotel february 28th for a food show
video roulette
i stayed in a regular room but i got to see my bosss suite  i still dream about it
wow my experience here was amazing
so we all decided to stop by here
super smooth and melts in your mouth
the ambiance was relaxing and modernly attractive
this was the most disappointing dinner we have ever had
they have a movie theater and two game rooms which are awesome
i will say that the joint is a nice venue for shows but thats not enough to warrant another star
as mentioned in other reviews the beds are heavenly every hotel employee greets you with a smile and the private elevators and checkin area are wonderfulbut the customer service here will keep us coming back time and time again
anyway at this point no big deal 20 minutes later we are in our new room 2505 the new room is all fine and dandy and then i notice that the floor is just horrible
the decor is pure deli
youd be watching something and it would start to cut in and out to the point where it was not watchable at all because it would cut out for long periods at a time
its opulence blew us away
its a great family place and the portions are large so expect to have leftovers
nearly every skit had me laughing out loud
was fr ein tolles schloss mit einem richtig genialen ausblick
would stay here again sure
a finished painting was hanging that we could refer back too
so sadly we turned around got our car and headed back home
everybody i talked to shared my feelings on this resort
also ive loved everything ive had from their uptown location which is a totally different approach from the truck
i wish we got more than 7 though
according to that one lady selling me tickets to ka this place is closing for good in a year
the wait staff was either understaffed or too into the concert to keep the drinks coming
for a reportedly 45star rated hotel it is severely lacking in amenities
morris helped us he was hilarious nice and helpful
and a lot of other movies for that matter
i love that
great hotel with awesome service
its not luxurious
btw they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make
check in was reasonably quick even though the hotel was very busy at this time
that said i certainly wont go back when im in az
still very good though
the blinds dont close 100 but its not a big deal if youre on a higher floor
these guys know how put them together to make you think we went to group of from work
there is no amenities other than shampoo and conditioner
just saw this show
on the day of a sunday morning at 9 am she came to meet dave and i at the beaches
they paid to update the rooms but did not do anything to keep out the noise
i was just wowed by the hotel lobbyloungethe decor and light sitting made it look so classy and intimate
visiting stuttgart for volksfest and as a car enthusiast for a visit to the mercedesbenz arena
i came from arizona to attend the bridal expo with my cousin the bride
without a doubt the best hotel ive stayed in in the usof awas in vegas for a conference at the venetian  so we decided to stay heregreat choice
a guy approached me and asked me if i needed in french first but he very quickly switched to english
since it was chilly inside it was difficult to keep any of your food warm everything got cold very quickly
my favorite place to stay in vegas
if ever in cle again i would come by and try more beers and grab a pub nosh
in the 1980s and 1990s when people were actually better behaved and more enjoyable to be around there were social events singles dances and various functions which drew them to resorts such as this especially on weekends
now to their credit they did offer to fix it however i did not have the time to wait for them to redo the cake so being my son is 9 today i did not think he would really notice
the pomegranate green tea is awesome
by far the biggest plus of this suite was the fact that it has two bathrooms
so fiance calls our bank to cancel the card for all we know she could try and use it
the elevators got jammed up a bit with so many people trying to use them that was a little annoying but not a big deal
i would definitely go back here
i havent stayed here yet but i feel im qualified to make a few observations about the brand new hotel and offer it 5 stars natch because of the time i spent loitering around the lobby outside the meeting rooms on the 25th floor near the pool on the 2nd and 3rd floor areas and so on
gillys gillys gillys
she wouldnt answer any questions i had and did not give a damn that i left unsatisfied
wow this place is awesome
they make their corn tortillas in house and they are excellent
the caesar salad did have a tad bit too much dressing on it but very tasty with one solid crouton on top
my boyfriend chose the salmon with the pineapple salsa topping which has  pineapple peppers and onions mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce
ive always loved this shop but they need to revert back to some of their older ways to keep some of their old customers
one thing i would prefer is that it should be more creamy but this can be my personal preference
the four seasons in vegas has to be the best place ive stayed at in sin city
all in all if you cant tell i love this place and recommend it to meat lovers and not so meat lovers alike
hes obviously not originally from this neck othe woods as his southern roots show through with his breakfast choice
this place is amazing
i loved the way the lighting in the bathroom was bright without blinding you
at the wedding ryan was very intuitive playing all the right music at the right times and overall did a fantastic job catering to our wants and needs while keeping things fun and exciting for our guests
a clean room and clean bedding should smell like nothing at all
really close to fremont street and you dont have to walk through a super shady area to get there
rooms are modern loft decor
i would recommend them to anyone
main course i had the mussel appetizer and it was delicious with lots of garlic
not saying this is the worst hotel ive ever stayed at but it is certainly in the bottom 5 the hotel has 2 floors but no elevator
she brings all her gear and even a few props but mostly we just wanted photos of us
that came like 3 hours later but at least it came
after dinner we had another cocktail at parasol down while we watched the water show
the things i do like now
i did not try the soup but she said it was very fresh and delicious
they are cooked perfectly and i love them in a togo box for the ride home
we sat outside in the shade by a cooling mister
we have stayed here twice in the courtyard and we were pinching pennies on purpose
we always order the guacamole and chips to start
the service was also incredible
having full view of the fountain and the water show made my stay in vegas 1000xs better
their afternoon tea at mandarin tea lounge was very average at best too
beautiful except the drawers on the desk were missing the granite as if someone had pulled it off

it seemed like a slow night so im not sure why we got stuck upstairs
we enjoyed the complimentary shuttle service even though it didnt start up earlier so we missed a couple hours of ces 2017 at night we went down to the game room for some pool and table tennis
the crap look you get from every employee minus the owner is so sour
back to front desk
dont pity the extra money and book another place
once on the casino i was looking for a bill breaker and i asked a staff member
they also have a tv with the attractions on it so you could watch from there
well we still dont know what the issue iswas but the ac literally would freeze the living room and kitchen but would not even drop the temperature down in the bedrooms they were constantly warm over 80 degrees and slightly muggy every night

i would go with one of their recommendations
room    the room was nice and bright and i loved the modern look and feel to it
kids loved the waffle maker

a hyundai having aspirations to be a lexus
i have to admit that the concierge was really great and helpful
after an hour of skating my kids were starving
checked opentable and found there was plenty of immediate availability
i cant speak to lattes and espressos because ive never tried them even though qs supposedly just got in a new espresso machine
love the place gorgeous to visit  very impressive
business must be booming there to be able to deter customers the way they do
i will say that it was convenient as far as location but not accommodating at all
venetian is one of my favorite hotels in vegas
rick came back to check on us later to ensure all was going well
if this doesnt make you want to try the pp then i dont know what will httpsvinecovbljovmpg3qw   in theory itd be fun to ride this all over the city but in reality this is a real bike that youre powering and its not that easy
i was right but still there were small glitches none of which marred my stay
i do not eat pork or beef and they had only one chicken item on the menu
overall bait  switch policies and a staff that is either incompetent or purposefully deceptive
paul our server was amazing and attentive
my company had a large meeting in town and we coordinated with them to have some local arizona treats available for the employees
then they let some people in the elevator one at a time
its a huge upscale overpriced tribute to social awarenessdriven consumption
you must get up early and go see the gondoliers going to work it is really a fun and wonderful thing to see
not sure how this filthy curtain blood or not has not been washed
while most hotels have noticble smoking the level here was so high i was gasping for air at one point my wife myself and one of the kids all were blowing blood out of our noses
additionally housekeeping comes knocking on your door super early so before calling it a night make sure to put the do not disturb sign on your door knob
im pushed over the food edge here
excellent food and coffee
the service was a little spotty but it is in line with the price and the great food makes it well worth it

the bathroom has a sexy pink light in it
as far as gallery shops go its pretty standard
special notice  sharir spelling
first of all i live near this place
the rooms themselves are decent at best not what i would expect from a hotel that brands itself as a marriott though
only 2 drawbacks i could ever concieve of was that its not on the strip and they only have 2 shuttles at odd times like 5 and 10
none of them looked like the pictures
now on to the rooms
dining staff needs more training
i only came here for the food
the lobby and bar were gorgeous with plenty of comfortable seating
dusko you are a real warriorthank you all
i know we went at 8 and they close at 9 but u should always have hot food  food that taste fresh
everything was on point on st pattys
then we show up for our timeshare update and she tells us our time is different from what we have written down
colleagues had cold water in a number of rooms
this place fills my random cravings if i happen to be around
they gave me a nice baby package shampoo powder etc
the customer service was rude and refused to refund our money for the night we didnt stay
but i must say its pretty good fresh tortillas are a big plussalsa isnt too badbeef tastes freshenchilada sauce is pretty goodrice and beans were greatchips are fresh saw them frying them up out backreally pretty good food helps that the price is right
mold along the bottom of the shower door and broken tile on the baseboard
rather you are reserving a time slot for two hours as per its policy
we didnt stay here  but our good friends did so we were able to partake of a poolside cabana and the experience totally made us regret our choice of hotels
2 mousse au chocolate noir  basically a chocolate mousse in a cup and with 34 pieces of delicious cookes to eat with the mousse overall the service was fantastic especially for a group of 22 roudy guysoh and the prefix came with wine as well
when they finally got the non smoking but non adjoining rooms  the old room was given out to other customers with their belongings still in the old room
if i need to compare that hotel to the cellphone world aria is like old nokia from the 2000 compare to the wynn experience which more resemble to iphone5
the upstairs bedroom was an open concept and looked down at the living area
gute lage luxurise zimmer gediegenes ambiente
onsite marketplace has reasonablypriced food and beverages for snacks or a small meal
we were still waiting at 630 for various parts ingredients to be available
you could be waiting and hour
its hot in here
she is highly professional and works to produce the highest quality video productions possible
they are even helping me sell my house and move
the vegas counterparts all seemed like a knockoff of the la originals like katsuya and the bazaar
ill call and ill fight but in the long run this never should have happened
waiter apologized but still overall a good experience
had the same problem last time i was there
overall one of my favorite hotels to stay in
i disagree with the description of this business
the shredded beef that was also on there supposedly had the most flavor
this hotel is totally fine
in comes the assistant desk manager from hell nichollete pelcher riding in on her high horse letting us know that she will take care of us and only charge us an extra 30 a day to upgrade to the two queen beds even though we had all ready paid the up charge once through bookingcom
later we got back to the hotel and talked with the front desk
the food was pretty good but the service was horrible
i tend to drink a lot during a meal and here my drink is always kept full without ever going empty
on the sunday we were visiting the pool umbrellas were available only in a ropedoff area with padded lounges
we went with chicken bruschetta and swai with mango salsa and our guests really enjoyed it
walls are thin so beware and make sure you have the tv on
nice staff my room seemed a little run down with a broken desk but it was all clean
i was impressed thank you
rooms were beyond comfortable  lovely king size bed walk in shower full sized bath tub and double sink
near campus and you can call ahead
mein zeil war etwas feines und gleichzeitig buntes dass nach echtem gekochten essen mit herzen schmeckt
after many many years of shielding my degrees from dust by leaving them in the package they were shipped in i decided that its finally time to upgrade their resting space to a wall in my new office
this place was those two stores combined
amazing rooms big cleaning beautiful view spacious bathroom and complementary coffee and the
i will never come back here again
i almost gave nyny 3 stars but just couldnt bring myself to do it
this was the first time ive stayed in a hotel where i had to pay to use the gym
have your waitstaff memorize the specials instead of inconveniencing other diners
so good luck if youre trying to exit the bathroom while someone is in the closet
service was good but i wouldnt rush back here anytime soon
i didnt think much of his persona or attitude because frankly he didnt have one and the part that got me pissed off to even say i will never step foot into wynn again is that he told me i didnt know how to play blackjack
tired of lugging trash and using same sheets and having to lug towels to front desk for more
we had a group of 8 walked in a few minutes before our reservation the hostess said our table is being setup right now and well be seated in 10 minutes
this is a budget to mid range hotel so adjust your expectations accordingly
the next day as im checking out it turns out they gave me the wrong room
since we hadnt eaten we were getting hangry we are taken to the nearby casino buffet to have the most awkward lunch with our sales guy ever who wants to sit and fake conversation while trying to pig out
i ordered the salmon last time i was here and it was so greasy i was sick all night
the wings are usually great but this time they we overcooked and dry
not to mention the costs associated with the whole mess
theyve got that charge you 8 bucks for an orange juice fridge but thats it
the haze people began to ask each party whether they would want vip passes to get in the club
all these extras were great
das essen ist lecker und das bier khl
the neighboring balconies are separated by a thick piece of glass but the glass is attached to the wall in a way that leaves a 2 inch gap between the wall and the glass
for checkout there are two major pluses 1 it has a computer with printer so you can print your boarding passes for your flight home and it has spots for rental care return
it was nice that garage parking is free
i guess the one pro is that it has a good location on the strip
thats why i love vegas about 45 avg a night for an on strip hotel with a nice pool
first do not park in the structure cause my truck got broken into
chips  salsa isnt free but worth it
cons rumor boutique looks like an old hotel that was remodeled extremely quickly to pass off as a high end boutique resort
unless i unplugged the nightlight
dont believe me
a separate shower and soaking tub
for the three nights we stayed at the venetian we found the service to be exceptional and by the push of a button we had a bell hop or hotel worker at our door within minutes
it was tasty all shredded and the slaw was actually what i liked the most i think it had a little spice to it either that or the meat did but the combo was really good
the pool is nice and theres a dj playing for half the day with the top hits
we paid extra for the view of the lagoon but the lagoon ended up being a circular artificial grass area they called the oasis lagoon
i would never suggest this establishment even to my worst enemy
the ambiance and the food or fantastic
i would highly recommend staying here to anybody coming to vegas
the redesigned rooms are modern and clean
for appetizers we ordered choose 3 for 11 bruschetta and kale salad 11
but the speaker outside was deafening with the vegas top 10 songs over and over and over
but nothing terribly special
dont try to be a salt nanny
awful experience and even worse food
we were stuffed
ordered spagetti and meatballs the meatballs sucked
the rooftop pool is tiny and the bar closes at 11pm
but again minor details and overall everything was reasonably clean
on to therapy and their chicken and red velvet waffle slider
thats all im saying
he was very friendly and professional and had my completed order back to me within 24 hours
anyway got baby back ribs and you couldnt even pick up a rib that is how much the meat fell off
im not staying in a room with bugs
we arrived around 10pm after a long drive and we had to wait behind multiple people because vdara only had one person checking in guests
we loved being able to use the foundation room before and after the ceremony
ive stayed in the hotel a few years ago and it was awesome
i counted over 50 while i was sitting there trying to pee
this one fact by itself was enough to make me swear off sheratons
youll be amazed
for dinner we had filet no meat for me please and snapper thats for me on the same place with amazing sweet potatoes
val the owner was extremely pleasant accommodating and welcoming
they carry echo 1 gg and kwa just to name a few brands
you really took the stress out of my prep and provided pure joy to everyone here
staffing are awesome
we got there early around 10 am on saturday they let us check in early and didnt even charge us extra
i had a 30 bracelet taken from my room after we left for a show at 830pm
there were a couple sharks at my table but everyone kept it pretty casual
my son ordered the broiled cod with fresh fruit and greek potatoes
beware all the receptionists at registration are extreme fobs
now if you guys could turn the temperature up on the pool id be forever grateful
there were at least 8 counters open so the line for each counter was short only 2  3 people in line
then you are taken to a hatchery where you can observe butterflies leaving their cocoons
another plus to staying off the strip you dont have to battle all that ridiculous traffic
a nice midrange vegas hotel
we called the front desk and told them about the problem
the font lobby was nicely kept and there is a giftcoffee shop
so hire more staff so its not an inconvenience for those paying to stay there
upon entering the stay well registration area i was greeted warmly and offered a bottle of tasty blackberry infused bottled water
after doing my business i saw that there multiple gum packets free for us to take
also be prepared to walk
i liked everything about my experience except the food and the hefty price tag that came with it
make sure you have a back up plan hotel just incase they do this to you too
one i checked in i realized this hotel in every was was trying to extract more money from me
however the pool area is sub par for a vacation condo place
hated that you could smoke in the hotel but hey youre in the south
we called immediately and they said they found the dress and would mail it out and they would charge my card
we had our family pictures taken a few weeks ago thanks to a living social deal
we could converse across the table but we had to raise our voices a bit
it looked like fun but it is an expensive extra
no standing room for us with our free tickets
stayed here for a conference wouldnt be my first choice on the strip but its not a bad one either
its a two burner electric stove in the kitchen
my girlfriends 6 year old daughter loves this place
i love riccis
unfortunately we were at the point where we didnt want to patronize their establishment in any way
i did eventually receive the album 3 days later via express 2day delivery but it was just the album no note or anything to apologize or explain the extreme tardiness so for that reason even though the photos were wonderful i cannot recommend cleveland boudoir
came here with a coworker while we had time to kill before we had to head to the airport
no where else you can get a ticket to such a high profile event with such a cheap price
the overall flavor fell flat
long ago i gave up gambling or staying on the strip except for a night here or there
everyone in our party enjoyed themselves
palace station is run down and ghetto so not surprisingly i only come here for the oyster bar
that was an average experience
midweek though the poker games here are more consistent
if i ever have any events  i always reserve a pie or two
planet hollywood towers next door looked great and similar if geared more to the younger and hip guests we were  of fitness center is 8 per person per day if you chose to use it what a rip off
i got very sick and luckily had my medicine on me or else it couldve been terribly worse
roomcontrol technology on the tv and at the bedside was surprisingly convenient for setting alarms and opening the curtains
wait to checkin and then they did not have the room we booked
we didnt stay here as we are locals
great for business or longer stays
a coworker broke his finger falling on the ice
our room was very nice huge comfy king sized bed flat screen tv and a huge bathroom
even though we were on the 60th floor the music from the club was obnoxious until 330am every night
there was a tea pot there was coffee but no tea
she spent more time crying  than enjoying so i dont  think  this is a good or safe option  for toddlers  but the  older  girls had fun
if youre lucky therell be a quiz on
when we entered it seemed worse than in years past
gotta come back for the mac and cheese
pretty much what youd expect for fast food
i live on 16th and missouri and their is no better place for hh
they even have a little fedex center
like nothing ive had before
at first we laughed but when one of the guests took his place and for about ten minutes was showing the public that middle eastern music is actually not just a horrific noise  and the bumbox boss was standing next to him with a face of a baby who got his caramel stolen  the whole scene started to look completely miserable
i will occasionally get take out dessert but i have no desire to eat here anymore
the room was every bit as tacky as a run down truckstop motel
go to breathe it is a amazing
their sound system could use an overhaul but it wasnt terrible
we tried the grapefruit brulee and it was warm juicy and the sugar crust cracked with every spoonfu
even though my family and i are going back next year and fremont is close by the walk we are not staying there
this is a huge plus for those living a healthy low carb or fitness lifestyle
my son loves to paint and painted a cup
the beer list was extensive but did not contain the one beer my husband wanted  lagunitas sumpin sumpin
the 450 for a pot of tea landed up being just one cup barely  and not even a mug
highly recommend this hotel its in a different league of its own
einfach super lecker
amazing chips and other apps and good drinks
do not have high expectations for this place because youll be disappointed with the colorful clientele and smoke ridden atmosphere
there this hotel is totally passable
my young son easton wife nikki and i were in early saturday evening and you provided your card and asked us for feedback regarding our dinner experience
room was indescribably gorgeous
amazing service their team was very professional and helpful
the staff was super friendly  the breakfast was adequate eggs grits bacon sausage varied pastries granola fruits and coffee and teas and the location is great
maybe im just spoiled from staying at many different hotels hip vintageboutiques motels you name it but to pay for a high rate here for me nah
their packages are reasonably priced for the whole wedding but the pictures are extra
then she asked me what i would like the message to say and i had to reply letting her know that i put it on the tablet and if she can find it
theres really nothing to complain aboutexcept that its a greasy fast food joint with greasy saltladen food that makes me happy while im eating it and immediately feel blah about 5 minutes later
easy to find off the highway
everyone was very nice
this review is for the concert venue only
after pouring over tons of reviews websites pictures youtube videos and vegas travel sites we settled on booking the executive suite at ti
the pictures on their website looked like a good hotel but once i arrived the pictures were nothing to the actual hotel
the quality of the food is excellent
i love the lighting and but wait coco locos do you know how many times i have driving by this place on my way to target
i mean for a comp room and 40nt not bad for being on the strip but when you are charging to have certain amentities like a coffee maker its crazy when all the other hotels have it in the room
and its definitely a pain during the summer in the ridiculous heat to walk the strip
mixte entre cuisine du terroir et cuisine franaise le m sur masson est lune des grandes tables de montral
the rooms here are beautifully decorated and have a fully stocked mini bar beware of pricing
they were clear from the beginning that a window table is not a guarantee and were accommodating in making it happen even though you can see the view perfectly fine no matter where you sit
sturgeon with grilled bacon and snails this is the largest piece of sturgeon i had for a while grilled to perfection sauce is tasty too
i would stay here over and over again
i gave it an extra star for the dealers and the rest of the staff
we called 40 per night
it was another five before we got water  when my guest asked questions about allergies which the waiter took as an order
prices i think are the same so i dont think there is casino inflation am i jaded by the strip to think all of them will inflate
we inquired about our entrees around 900 and she seemed horrified that they hadnt come out yet
crudo shattered potato chips deviled eggs meatloaf strawberry basil gin lemonade chocolate pudding rice pudding all of it soooo delicious
the only okay thing about the tropicana in my opinion is the poolyet again we spent our entire saturday at the mandalay bay pool and this one is lackluster in comparison
we did not order appetizers or drinks
then she continued very rude that if it was in the section it was a christmas item and stated those have a orange sticker and this is red
another great time at sanctuaryi had an outside bath looking up at the stars which was part of our room
got their special price online and ended up in their west tower at the end of an extraordinarily long hallway
she took care of us for hours and made sure we had cold alcoholic beverages at all times
instead of asking these people to step aside we were forced to wait while the hostess tried to find them a place to sit
we left feeling disappointed
angus burger too
after reading the reviews we decided to try it
when your food is ready they call out a number from your receipt
i would give them another try but i would stick to the salads and seafood because my dining companions food looked much better than mine
if you do decide to buy into hiltons scam make sure you ask them about any additional charges before you purchase this garbage deal
cool ambience okay food
went there last night and was not very happy  the server had a attitude problem was unorganized had no idea who ordered what and did not bring our drinks to our tables we had to go up to the bar and order our drinks
i had trouble getting on my computer the night before so i was not surprised
im not saying that the puzzles were easy just that they were logical
this lounge is accessible by tram from any gate
was just in this evening and ordered the trio of sliders dal makhani and some garlic naan
a nice added touch they through in an extra slider for my wifes birthday
in the little itsybitsy town it features a bateslike motel a general store and a petting zoobut i like to sit at the little restaurant bar and get a nice frosty sarsparella on a hot day
not as good as it used to be
finally got to bed at 530and this is only day 1
love this place
since we qualify for senior daywe take advantage of the extra savings the cup of starbucks and the treat
after our visit is over though and ive had time to ponder the full gamut of errors i almost have difficulty with two stars
overall we love the experience here we would definitely come back if you creative and imaginative you should definitely stop in
brad michelle and their team were prompt and clear with their communication
maybe i was supposed to dip it into something
all else is nothing
went to the sunday buffet and it was excellent at a good price
prior to that it was another 10 years ago
we both had a few mango sangrias that were very good
at this point i was getting frustrated
i booked on orbitz and got a great deal
so if everything is is so good why 4 stars
tiramisu it was good
i was not a fan of the dressing on the green salad but over all worth it and well priced for food on the strip and it was busy
the garlic bread was just how garlic bread should be crispy buttery and full of garlic
also there is a fridge but no microwave so i guess if you want your food warmed up you have to go all the way down stairs
the clarendon is truly one of a kind
16 several other guests told us similar stories
it feels like a motel 6 mattress but everything else is nice
one of my favorite vegas hotels
mine was served cold
huge lounge area and very comfy
i will certainly come back and try other items on their menu
they were describing some old tv
there were also some nice outside spots to hang out and have a drink outside
we really enjoyed it
super conveniently located walkable everywhere of interest
i am a huge fan of their soul
it was some of the best indian food i have had
after 20 years of dropping in here now and then as a local i have to finally post a review and my 2 cents regarding the casinosportsbook and service
decided to have dinner here when looking for a byob in the west island
their sides are also very good
im giving them three 3 stars because the staff during my visit on 06 may 2017 ad was spread too thin
property has an interesting second floor old school casino area complete with a bar only two weak beers on tap stick with the long bar downstairs and an outdoor patio fantastic for people watching must check out
our food was outstanding
his nice comments and his reminder to pickup my forgotten soda put a smile on my face
i lost my id but had a photocopy
and the shower head
within mins of a call extra towels are bought to us with a smile
72 for 4 beers
would never stay there again
i love staying in a hotel that has a lot of history elvis lived and performed there barry manilow was there barbra streisand performed there and some of the james bond movies were filmed there
i will likely not stay in a doubletree hotel again due to this experience
i guess somebody needed our clothes more than we do
tables have low buy ins and a decent variety of machines
this is also one of few hotels that offers free wifi internet
we tried to check in at 11 and were told we could go wait and they would hold our luggage and should be able to get in room between 23 and they would call when room was ready
okay  i take back my tower 2 preference i think its tower 1 now
never a complaint
im not sure if the jalapenos are necessary but its pretty good
the workers are rude you even have to think twice before asking something because they answer very sarcastically and seemed like theyre miserable
we have complained front desk many times but their action was too late
this is a great casino
one complaint anywhere else and at least you get an apology we never even got that
were definitely looking forward to coming back for happy hour and trying some of those 1 oysters and of course more truffle fries
we were allowed to check in super early 10am and drop off our bags before heading out for some sightseeing
she just switched locations from the galleria mall to her new spot off of eastern
with each package you get a certain amount of ceremony photos
which made them horrible
the service is great
i have been eager to check out the brewery market event thats been happening at the wynchwood barns on select sundays 1pm  5pm over the summer  httpbrewerymarketcom
staff was polite and very accessible
she was pleasant
i took pictures to show him and he finally admitted they missed the room
nice cocktails and bar area
rooms were extremely clean the choices of restaurants were numerous and all high quality
we ended up buying a canvass and a mosaic framed print
ended with some cheesecake which is heavenly definitely a place i will be returning to
the employees at the tiki along with the people ive meet either regulars or first timers all were fun and unique people who made my experiences memorable ones
will definitely use their services again for my next trip coming soon
there were masses of people everywhere and the timing of the fountains was not every 15 minutes as usual
our room is gorgeous
the staff is very friendly
this puzzled me because bathroom itself was big doors are slightly hard to open
bathrooms were run down and toilets stained
some have 2 beds  1 pull out couch two sinks and lots of mirrors to get ready for clubbing
cant remember the name of the sandwich i got however it was very good
i havent been here in years and i wanted something better than taco bell but didnt want chipotle
ill never forgot on my second visit there alex ran out of the restaurant after my family and i us looking in our pockets assuming wed left something behind solely for him to tell us it was a pleasure serving us and he hopes to see us back there
i dont ice skate but i found it amazing to be in another world where the locals have embraced the beauty of snow
i had the bacon cheeseburger and it was ok the crinkle cut fries could have been cooked longer they were on the soggy side
awesome just awesome
the menu has your standard greek fare
the club inside was not really my cup of tea  to stiff
outstanding friendly service
i spoke with the front desk and a couple hours later i had a new room in the pyramid
we packed our stuff as fast as possible and got the hell out of there
we will definitely be checking it out again from time to time and maybe even spending time here during our stay for edc considering we were told that the marquee pool was going to be the official pool for edc pool parties but that was incorrect and the one day they do have something is sold out
i do wish the prices were more reasonable for memberships and that the air hockey table worked properly
associate from another came out  said they moved handing out an e hampton mesa address
getting to the line is no more uneventful  as they inform you check in is at 3 pm  its now 10 am but for a payment only  20 you can  precheck in  and  if you dont want that  there is another army of coons willing to take care of your bags until such time as you can occupy a room and then deliver the bags to you
being on the strip it is close to the major hotels and within walking distance
i went back and forth between giving this place four or five stars but i settled on five because although not as awesome as the cosmo its still pretty awesome
they are so upto date with the technology and amenities the service is impeccable from the valet process to check out
when i walked out the door i saw a guy sitting in a golf cart
the casino is pretty run of the mill and more something youd see downtown these days in vegas
wife had 3 meat combo ribs greasy and end pieces pulled pork dry brisket was shredded like all meats needed lots of sauce
very grateful to have a washer and dryer unit although its very small in capacity so one load  half a load
seriously this place is awful and if you even consider staying here after reading this you shouldnt be traveling
if they were able to bring elvis back from the grave for one night only and only i was a ticket holder it would be an hour before they even realized i was in line
boulevard pool as chronicled in my blvd pool review linked below they kept me from entering shows that i had tickets for because i was arriving too late according to them
on the 2nd day of our trip my husband and i decided to go down to the business center and get this straight
the floors were sticky the trash hadnt been empty or cleaned from their last party
yea that is just not classy
they explained well and i really enjoyed
kishke 10 this thing was amazing
but im not i like classic decor the type you would see at the venetian that is elegant
the man at the counter was sooooo slow
check in is always smooth
large enough to room 5 girls  great view of the bellagio fountains right below huge bathroom clean and friendly front desk staff
she and i came ready to eat
the portions are decent and the prices make this place a great option for students on a budget
i used in a flash for my party and everyone had a great time with it
pool was being remodeled an gym was waaaaaaaaaaaay to small
the place itself is gorgeous
it was her idea to have a server which was very affordable
the hot tub is a long rectangle which in my opinion is a way better shape for a hot tub
if your in vegas i recommend the mirage
it was a minor thing but the manager put the appetizer on the house
that became the least of my worries as the weekend progressed
i bet that will cost them a grand in lost revenue for the week
the chicken was so good and the waffles were a savory waffle with chives and bacon
i would stay here again
we just relocated here from florida and we were scared about finding a new stylist we had the same one for 10 years in florida well taylor fits the bill she did just what we asked and are so happy
for what it is harrahs is a little run down but still worth 3 out of 5 stars for both the casino and the hotel
the ranch attraction is cheesy but everything else was worth it
the worst part of the hotel is how thin the walls are
it was empty when we arrived we placed our order and a crowd came right after
i love the peter lik photography adorned at the checkin checkout lobby area
4 when you check in you get a ton of coupons for food and match play good deal
tldr i highly highly recommend turnt up tours
we scanned through the cute little stores and the different attractions
yes of course i will
very boutique like
that being said some of my friends and family that stayed there as well had a few complaints
fantastic addition to the cleveland area
we had a side of the basil mashed potatoes which were incredible
door locks are reset when the housekeeper cleans your room
the ambience was pleasant and id much rather prefer a venue like this that a conversation is easy to have versus a place pumping music all night
we checked in and were given what i later discovered was the smallest floor plan on the property
we had a standard room but had to move as it was right over the cosmopolitans party pool and the thumping music was loud
i called guest services
overall this is a huge disappointment for such a reputable brand
my husband called them and their response was they were busy
everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great
sound is pretty good if a bit cavernous think talent show at your highschool auditorium but a bit more refined its nice to be at a venue thats built around performance
i settled on the pork chop with an apple aujus rosemary mashed potatoes i believe and country style green beans
i then got frustrated because i felt unattended and that i should have been able to leave the booking to the person at the counter and not a fucking screen
my best friend recently got hitched last week and she held her reception at the vue
very small horrible lighting white tub shower curtain white toilet the usual hairdryer given it was just not appealing to the eye at all

she customized my pops to match my dress and bonus she make the inside rainbow
room  i reserved 2 fountain view suites and requested it to be on the same floor and high floor

this is aimed at anyone who wants a pleasant hotel experience
cpk was good
the art of merlot lacks character enthusiasms and creativity

cashiermanager is loud and abrasivenever smiles never says thank you
i am so happy that i went with them for our wedding
beautiful facilities friendly staff easy parking and excellent machines and atmosphere
staff is very friendly and helpful
our dessert which we ordered was the wrong one delivered
the beer menu has a red stamp with no beer for you when one is gone and an up next section to show you whats coming on line as beer drops off the list
the hallways reek of smoke the nonsmoking rooms reek of something indescribable a friend was lucky enough to get one the carpets are disgusting we made reservations in august for a nonsmoking nonpet room and got both a smoking and pet one which reeked of both
we will be back in the future
stayed here with my sister
by noon the next day there as no call
lastly this is a cute hip little place with great atmosphere
cameron hooked me up with the information needed to weigh the pros and cons
the only downside is that we didnt get any cellphone reception in the main hall
the best server ever
she could have helped the other guests who were waiting instead of talking rudely to her employee
it was okive had a zillion times better
best deal in the heart of the strip
he offered a free vegetable samosa and free kheer to apologize
i booked a group of five rooms and every room was okay except for one the bed had a really big lump in it
great place to slip in to watch the game
yes it is on the more pricey side as each entree ranges from 1220 but id come here again considering the options for cute brunch joints are disappointingly miniscule
if you want an excellent dining experience from friendliness to cleanliness and awesome food in between look no further than the capital chophouse
the killers drummer ronnie vannucci invited a rolling stone journalist here to grab lunch at the snack bar in the casino

i ended up trying their chicken and waffles
the employees are so nice
for saturday and sunday we had a penthouse and it was beautiful
had a little luck at the tables but we will never return to treasure island on future trips to vegas
horrible night sleep
i had a select room and i totally loved the place
so glad to have a chickfila in vegas now
i paid ahead of time through groupon but when i arrived that was not the price i agreed on
i had a confirmation number but after looking around at the soiled carpet taking into account the lack of staff and the poor attitude of the one person working i decided to cancel my reservation and move on

all games are 1 hr long but since they werent too busy at 12 noon the friendly staff allowed us to stay until we completed the gamean extra 15 mins
my husband got a 3 meat combo and i got a two meat combo with high hopes of incredible leftovers
i am certain that this can be done at other times through out the day
i really enjoyed the amenities
i liked the master onoff light switch and the privacy and service switches next to the door that illuminated signs outside which replace the old doorknob hang tags
best deal on the strip
i was looking for a quick lunch while in vegas and turned to yelp to help me locate a good spot
then housekeeping knocked on my door as i was about to fall back asleep and asked me the same question
theres a road that runs up behind the place banksville ave not banksville rd
where do i start
id much rather stay at their sister location red rock
this hotel is pretty good for business trips in the pittsburgh area and is pretty close to the airport
our hotel was right around the corner from here so it was in the absolute perfect location for us
they just give a blanket statement that there could be fees but charging for internet access
the room was very nice considering it was a standard room
they had both books i was looking for and way more
they try to make you feel as if youre too stupid to know better or that you must not have money if youre not taking the deal being offered
its hidden on the hotel valley ho property but thankfully its a totally separate venue
told them to keep the money and checked into hotel palomar for 20 less a night
this is one clean casino
the sauce is unbeatable and the fried okra is perfect
location not sure why all escape room places are so hidden
its past circus circus so its a bit of a walk to the main part of the strip starting at encore
on to the casino  as mentioned nearly no theme except celebrity lookalikes because nothing says chinese imperial palace like dressing up as rod stewart
this should have guarenteed me a spot front and center but because my tickets were will call not my fault i won the tickets in a contest  i had to use a separate line
maybe 10 teas in total and most of them run of the mill teas
he called me after a couple minutes of waiting and took us in for our photo session
for those of you who are using the reviews to decide if you want to stay i say go for it
i forgot exactly what i had i think it was a turkey bacon and swiss sandwich with mayo but i remember it was good
all in all my boys experience at psgc was great
after our parties i always get approached by parents for her contact information so they can book her as well
they even opened my girlfriends door
in general gaming odds in old las vegas are some of the best in the state
the smoking really irritated everyones eyes in the party i was traveling with
and he then said ok bye and hung up abruptly
i lifted the sheets and noticed the tag said queen and was so upset
the food alone was worth the trip but the service was over the top
the manager was nice to take  off the salt lick mushrooms off of our bill so we saved 12 but my overall eating experience was horrible
the ribs tasted more steamed than bbqd though
sad to say but my stay was mediocre
great rate and right in the middle of the city centre
as soon as the movie stopped playing we could still hear noise from downstairs but it still wasnt too bad and the kids were quickly asleep after a long day of travel
this can be a gift or a curse depending on who approaches you or the occasion for your visit
food consistenly good and a touch above other frc outlets
we had a little shindig that night no complaints we accidentally checked out late they were nice about that too
i expected it to be high but even i didnt think theyd charge for a small bottle of sapphire to make one regularsized martini
my bachelorette party was sub par
as it will elicit laughter and warm responses from the audience
this didnt matter to her one bit she was adamant with all the  empathy and compassion of a robot they were unable to seat us for another hour
its kinda expensive but its worth it bc its a lot of fun and theres a lot of stuff to do
this is a warning to anyone who has driven on tracks before and knows how to drive
i suppose luck was on my side when i entered myself in one of their twitter contests and won a free night stay at the hotel
they called the manager but he refused to come to the concierge desk
be prepared to have a 600 holding fee placed on your credit card that will be removed when you leave
wifi is slow
the place was recommended by friends after they went one night when it was carnival themed
the decoration is gorgeous and so well thought out
however this time of year early june it is very affordable
why they couldnt give me a complimentary upgrade the way airlines sometimes do if theyre sold out of coach seats is beyond me  clearly they were uninterested in any future stays by me
i thought it would be too rich but it was on point
theres not many ice machines and the 2 available are at the back of the hotel
we were willing to pay the 9500 perperson fee because it seemed like such a promising event and a fun way to ring in 2016   however after about an hour it was apparent that we made the wrong choice
when the bill came there was an error
place is brand new so everything is modern and nice
this explains why i couldnt find as many examples up when i was searching and speaks volumes about their integrity and professionalism as well as their discretion
best bbq and friendly service
the hotel was pretty empty when i stayed
what really stands out is their monday night special which is appetizer entree dessert for 25
the tour experience was immersive and we learned a lot about the locale and downtown culture aside from enjoying delicious food and refreshing beverages at great local restaurants
you are smacked dab in the middle of las vegas blvd
unfortunately it seems that encore has nothing like that
but i will go back to frankies i will never go back here
beds were comfortable
when it was time for a shuffle it was the slowest shuffle i have ever seen in my life
really cool casino love the atmosphere
the light in the shower didnt work
not staying at the hotel
definitely wouldnt be coming back here
dont recommend delano to a friend stayed at the delano for the first time on our family vacation with our dog
i started with a bowl of tortilla soup
the place was very calm and i enjoyed every bite of my food especially the dessert
also if you book a room with 2 double beds you are not guaranteed 2 double beds
un emplacement parfait   cinq mins du centre eaton et tous les autres centres commerciaux autours en face du mus dart contemporain de montral  tout prs de nombreux restaurants et pas trop loin du vieux port
market cafe had the skinny scramble not so great
the decor was beautifully coordinated crisp and clean  and also had an element of fun
ask for justin he has been mixing and perfecting cocktails and martinis for years
the front desk person was rude and sarcastic
checkin itself wasnt bad but we arrived at noonish on a tuesday so there wasnt a line
definitely come by and if youre like medine at the bar
going to the buffet on a friday or saturday
it is a step above the wynn but allows for easy access to it so you can easily pass back and forth between the two hotels
the hallway smelt pretty bad
we were hungry and just replied with an alright and ordered our meals
anyway our visit started okay
steak sub used to be cubed steak but now its chipped steak
the movie hangover made them famous so they are now able to get away with horrible service and a horrible experience all around
the sheets were fresh and clean
also the brownies are sick
valley hos rooms are the perfect balance of boutiquetrendy and luxury
just go outside go down harmon and it takes half the time as it would going through the hotels
there yoga classes are also great
average rooms good price and great location on the strip
last time i ordered they had my pizza here in less than 15 minutes  oh and if your gonna try them out order a pickup on tuesdays they have the 2 for 1 special which aint bad for two medium pizzas at 1199 a piece   and if your looking for parking i usually just park next door at ogs i dont think the bouncers there really care
also the rooms have kitchenettes and there is a grocery store across the street so you can save some money
will definetly be making this place a regular spot
also not to forget that fashion show mall is just a bridge away from wynn
the rooms had television with netflix bedside tables and a little bar desk area with lots of goodies and drinks
these flour ones were doubled up as well
about what i expected for under 50night motel
quickest checkin ive ever had in vegas comfortable bed the cons shades dont effectively block out light several minutes walk to the strip fire department has a station next door and we were woken up several times the first night by sirens the couch cushions slid all over so the couch was very slumpy and uncomfortable nothing in the kitchenettes to make them functional available upon request though many of our rooms electronic items barely worked tv remote buttons for shades a couple of the lamps
the bed was very comfortableit is the decor that could use an updating
rebecca the hot bendy instructor started us off with stretches then a routine that involved gyrations booty bumps back bends crawling on the floor and spin moves like the fireman
with total dread i called vegascom customer service to see if they could do anything
liquid was gorgeous
cant wait to go back
as a result bf and i sat apart to watch the games and were peering up at two lone screens showing the gs game that were probably a good 80 feet away
shes heartbroken over this
the urinals are troughs which i have never seen before and helps fit even more people so the mens line just flies
if youre not youre a fool if you dont get the fries
i never felt such a high amount of tension being a customer checking in between myself and the hotel clerk chin
i have  lived in japan new york new jersey and i had a lot of different hairstylists
while we waited on our food other people arrived and after being told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes they left
im watching this and they havent even offered to give her room with a credit card to hold the room
i have no idea
the birthday boy however was given the presidential suite which its fair to say that he had the very best of everything
theres a waterpark too and the waterpark has a bar so if you dont have the guts to conquer the tall slide take a shot of their cheapest tequila and see what youre made of
called again and they had to send maintenance up here to fix the toilet only after my roomate said he needed to take a dump right now
the tv curtains lights and a lot more it can control also we visited the pool area and wow its big and they have different sections
learned a lot on this cruise about the history and about the volcanic rocks near by
i was able to see the room and everything was clean and really nice
i stayed here this past weekend
its dark loungey and romantic
i feel bad for anybody who thinks theyre in for a romantic weekend at this boutique hotel  theyre going to be very disappointed
it has divided areas great idea
i was there for a conference and my room was actually pretty good in comparison to what some of my fellow attendees endured
another cool feature was that the floor was covered in a carpet that is meant to look like hardwood floorhard to explain you have to see this for yourself
my personal preference is the tomato based
send him to a serious table or fire him please
this was our second time at second city and it was just as funny this time around
i would not recommend staying here
i highly recommend this place to those who love warm sandwiches
hash house a gogo
beautiful new facility that forgoes any kitschy theme for a modern classy vibe
have been here before and had a great time so we decided to book for our honeymoon
stick to the great dane or walmart if you want service
worth every dollar
housekeeping will come back once an hour every hour until youre ready for them
i had to keep my sandals on  blood stains on the curtains  some kind of dried up stains on the floor  our view wasnt good at all there was some kind of construction going on
it makes loosing or winning much less intimidating
had one of the best burgers here the double burger with bacon
i thought the price of 10900 a night for a thursday and friday night in vegas was an exceptional value for the quality of the room and the location of the hotel on the strip
i was just there for edc weekendmy 21st birthday
room was clean
everything is fresh and tasty
the sports deli is good too
i typically get the burrito with chicken white rice pinto beans both queso sauces cheese sour cream guacamole maybe pico and lettuce in a flour tortilla
okay time to check my email
zufllig haben wir auf der weiterfahrt das waldheim raichberg entdeckt und haben uns bei hochsommerlichen temperaturen in den sehr ruhigen lauschigen aussenbereich gesetzt
but the food is good
bonnie was always extremely professional on top of everything and we never had to stress about how the catering would turn out
i would return
didnt actually stay here although i considered it when i was making vegas reservations the only thing im reviewing is the pool
we stayed saturday night into sunday morning on fathers day weekend and it was a little packed but they handled it well
theres no intermission so make sure you pee before you go in or youll undoubtedly miss something cool
yeah that good
it makes me wonder if they even changed the sheets
i am pretty discerning and continue to be impressed
it was overall a good experience to do once but not worth that money with the groupon
overall i would never go anywhere else
i tried my first chulata here
so no problem
even though the hotel needs some freshening up its completely liveable and the location along with the price are really good so i would stay here again
next day i came to judge the bbq competition
props were pretty lame
im frequently around warrensville heights so i decided to give avalun a try
it is right next to harrahs and directly across the street from the mirage with a fairly central location on the strip
ive had much better rooms in hampton inns and holiday inns
im not sure what the problem was as i carefully explained to the woman that took our order exactly what i wanted
it reminded me of very high end new york
us never being there and not knowing how it worked we asked questions what seemed to piss her off
the gratuity was included so the woman who walked our nachos over to us automatically grated herself a whopping 400
we live in north peoria by lake pleasant area
you are better off finding a restaurant near by the area
i stayed here for a week
the office that i was visiting is conveniently located across the street which made it very convenient
food 710  value 710  service 710  ambiancedcor 1010 the food is good but its not so good that warrants a twohour wait during the brunch rush
further the 5th level access route is completely open to the elements
plus the prices were different than listed on their site
check your options and find a different place to experience laser tag there are others far superior to stratum
pain in the butt
great place to watch a game
although our view of the fountains were spectacular i found the room to be dingy old and small compared to the wynn or encore
it was good
terribly disappointed with this establishment
staff was friendly
the palomar kimpton has by far the best service ive ever received form a hotel
and the lady at the nugget  said what do you want me to do about it
my husband and i love the orleans
the first nights meal was just for the sake of convenience  being exhausted from the traveling earlier in the day
they are complete amateurs
neighborhood is on the edge of a pretty scary hood but where this hotel is seemed safe
there is something about the software and prices that attracts beginners which is good but at the same time they need to understand rules and stick with them  they failed to do that and i cant recommend this place
stick to the lunch menu unless you want to loosen your belt
this was unequivocally the single worst restaurant experience i have had in pittsburgh
thanks wyndham for keeping our guest happy and comfortable
they did take my cell phone  and let me know they would call as soon as my room was ready
i will happily stay at this hampton inn again
if you like eggs benedict you have to try it
and sanity is probably that most important for me when i am in lv
she wasnt very prompt at responding to emails and she was mia on the day of the wedding after phone calls and text messages
so of course they went back and worked the numbers
the place is quiet nicely manicured with a ghost town of an area on property that includes a small market restaurants etc
033 liter getrnkeflaschen am automaten 160eur sandwiches knapp 3eur
lots of indoor and outdoor seating
the bell desk was nice they kept our bags until our limo picked us up after checking out
furthermore there were no bath tubs in the room just shower so i was unable to give my baby a bath
we had tias royal islanders come perform at our luau in victory at verrado and they did not disappoint
people like that are what makes me never attend your business again and i have went the last three years in a row
this hotel is terrible do not stay here
i guess you cant really complain because of prices but dang you know somethings off when the resort fees cost more than the room rate
maybe it was the high ceiling and the beam of the sunlight coming through and warming up the whole 2 floors of the restaurant
best apple cider in the world
the night event the event was very smooth and the guests loved the food and service provided
the location on the strip cant be beat and i will definitely be coming back
two of my favourite nightclubs in las vegas are also at encorewynn blush and xs
we arrived on july 3rd so not a busy day for checks since the holiday weekend was still going
the level of cleanliness in the room is fantastic  even immaculate
wir waren am 31102010 gegen 1830 uhr in den adler gegangen
another five minutes goes by before he gets his toast and is told that there is no tabasco sauce anywhere in the building nor in the building across the street that servers have had to run to in order to get things that are obviously missing from the restaurant it seems that the company owns both properties but youd think they would keep all of their restaurant stuff in one convenient location
the boat consists of 2 levels
note to management please explain to gianni that if the tone and manner that youre speaking with customers causes the next table to turn around and listen youre probably doing something wrong
i enjoyed the separate his and her master baths however in the female bathroom there is only a jetted tub
the only thing i dont recommend is the samosas
i ordered a ny strip steak with french fries one glass of cabernet and 2 very specific on the 2 glasses glasses of ice water
the room was filthy
i can tolerate a lot of things but a hotel that treats a guest that poorly will never have my money again
they have several younger staff in orange vestshirts  walking around making sure kids are safe and not accidentally flashing their underwear for girls in princess dressesseriously i thought good work ethic was dead  but not with these guys
highly recommend their salads carpaccio and pizzas
the staff couldnt be more helpful i checked in early with ease found toothpaste at the bellhop when the hotel store told me they had run out and i even got my shipped packages brought to my room in less than 5 minutes from the time i called the front desk
what a treat
everything about this place screams im so awesome and i dont care what you think because being unique isnt perfection its being awesome at who or what you are
whereas i used to be a steak guy id given up preferring fish or pasta at a good steakhousejust too hard to find a well cooked steak it seems
it is just one boring room with a dance floor
she ended up calling back about 10 minutes later and with a very rude tone told us that she was sending up another voucher
thats without me putting money in he video poker machine
im all about location location location
we did buffet style and their dishes were very nice and classy
i felt very luxury per say
i ended up going with the full montagu
overall the place wasnt bad though i did not really have any reason to interact with the staff and was only there for a couple days
one of my favorite mexican places ever
im quite satisfied with their service
they have managed to change a great neighborhood intimate restaurant into a mess hall food court
their nightclub is reason enough to avoid this entire hotel
lazy river and wave pool were great for kids
and to have the janitor in our room fixing our problems when we cant even go out
i now want to go out and buy the bed and pillows they have
lazy river wave pool and main pool volleyball court w sandmany places for beverages and bonus free water cooler watermelon infused so you can stay hydrated
the ambience is amazing
hauptspeise waren zwei mal grosse salate einmal davon mit hhnchenbrustfilet sehr saftig und lecker merkt meine freundin an
they said it was crowded but they managed to find 1 seat that they took turns laying on
i admit that i often dream about it and wonder how i could ship a few loaves to austin
had a tuna melt and it was hella good
they bring you just half at a time keeping the other half warm
i was really excited because it was near the babys nap time
the pad thai and cashew check are also great
1st time staying here and we havent been here for 30 minutes and im pissed off
you cant go wrong with any of the beer
variety of rolls and sashimi are lacking
lunch with friends
my mom and i were searching for hotels that we hadnt stayed at before that were reasonably priced and close to the mandalay bay convention center
the sticky buns are to die for
ive tried many different clubsclassessports and my gym is consistently better for the quality of instruction  fun
storm down to desk really mad and tired now
we do understand the importance of vacationing but how are we supposed to enjoy vacations when we know that were broke because of the payment for the time share
other than a couple restaurants in town ive been here more than anywhere else i dont work or live since moving to vegas
if this keeps up maybe a new owner will come in and make it right again like it used to betoo bad it doesnt take much to be nice as a mom and pop store ownerwill not consider this store again as a must stop any longerhope they learn quick before its too late
you make it the way that you like it
we would definitely use yoomee again
a very well run complex
the pork bbq sandwich was strangely addicting kinda like i imagine crack would be if i had ever tried it
they all died within one day
2 no room service or mini bar but there were a few complimentary waters and sodas in the fridge that were welcome for guests to enjoy
room booked out on wed
but the real issue is signage
very cool and unique surprise
especially important when you have a big group and friends of friends situation
la chambre tait magnifique trs calme au 34e tage
the staff have always appeared cool and acted more like its a job they have to do instead of providing higher quality service to their clients
comfortable beds delicious breakfast and the friendliest service
large portions came out on the plates
my friends sink fell off the wall in another room
crazy party vibe
the food was decent
joey the customer service rep tells me that she can see my early check in and out payments doesnt know why the front desk lady couldnt
i was hesitant to get in on it because gourmet and taco cart sounds very contradicting
my only complaint with this hotel is the cleaning system
yes the rooms at the palazzo may be slightly nicer but they are also stuffier
the minister kinda sucked and parts of the ceremony were kinda uncomfortable but all said and done were married and were happy
liked the stairsvery comfortable and spacious
i recommend the dougie to anyone looking for dependable friendly and quality transportation service
the queen bed seemed smaller than it should have been and the bedroom was so small you could barely walk around the bed
its also a bakery restaurant grocery store gift shop imported appliance store and more
been to this location four or five times work lunch sunday funday happy hour graduation  celebrations the place is big enough to accommodate large groups has shuffleboard bean bags photo booth table tennis to entertain everyone cocktails are nice but not light liquor imofood is good pretzel balls are fun chicken meatballs are tasty the mussels and toast is also a good  choice i think entree wise ive probably had the western burger and the most often valet is convenient and cheap good selection of beers on tap and liquor options i usually do mystery grab bag on sundays random disgusting beer and shot for five bucks
they also give you free slot play when you join the club 3500
the chicken is always prepared perfectly
i told him how this was by far the best brisket i had outside tx it was even better than some places in tx
but while i was eating i watched  the same gal who took my order  assemble my dish go from task to task without changing gloves
1 morning they allowed coffee into the pool area and another morning they didnt so it depends on the person at the gate
i slept poorly very noisy bed had no top sheet just a thin duvet and a flat pillow
that becomes very important when operating a fully automatic weapon
you have either become complacent or dont care
all the sandwiches are huuge and only 10 with chips and a drink
i recommend you try this place every day
i believe we got two rooms for around 70
relative to its dallas sibling the vegas location of the centurion lounge is just one step below
waiter returned to tell us the tap was dry on our option of beer would we like another option
i just dont understand how such a technologically advanced resort doesnt offer expedited checkout via the tv
i didnt find the regular rooms showers or closets as unsavory as some yelpers have although i am still unclear why packets of butter were smeared all over my friends room dooroutside wall
the reviews were great on yelp but we were disappointed
that single elevator is painfully slow so if you are not carrying much just walk the stairs though its not the cleanest or safest feeling but it will save you 5 minutes seriously
but decided to wait a little longer another 15 minutes and still nothing i grabbed a manager that was walking by oyr table told her my situatuon again and went into the kitchen to check on my order she comes back and tells me that in 3 minutes out wings will be done and she will personally bring them out i was hust mad but waited
overall dont stay in the courtyard
gaming in the casino was fairly typical of strip casinos  payouts seemed tight and there were little to no lowstakes tables available but all the dealers and floor personnel were friendly and competent
free breakfast was solid
their pizzas are amazing their meats are perfect and best of all very well priced
even purchased from the hilton
i had a coupon card that was invalid and was turned away but one employee named genesis overheard and hooked me up with a free meal
the plate looks just like the menu
the luxor is a decent place for a decent price  it truly is an example ofyou get what you pay for
i always keep everything very organized even when away from home so housekeeper work is very routine when it comes to our room at hotels
it was a heaping portion of buttery mashed potatoes with chunks of carrots mixed in
her room was more spacious though
you can not beat that rate
they fixed it quickly enough but the last thing i wanted was a tech working in the room for an hour on valentines day
i ask for champagne and got it in a glass instead of a flutethe chinese restaurant food was grose awlful and very nasty
this place as had a bit of a face lift
hands down an awesome way to start our weekend
we paid our balance in cash
she came back with an adjusted bill removing our 2 drinks we ordered at the beginning we she first took our order saying we were her first customer as she just arrived and had no other tables
thats about it
730 on sunday morning is the time when the daily dose shifts from being a serviceable and pleasant upscale eatery to being a magical experience
this place is clearly using false advertising they send out coupons and refuse to honor them and say well you can still bowl at full price
all in all you get what you pay for i guess
maybe the best ive had
there are drinks throughout the facility in case you become thirsty after sweating your life out in one of the heat rooms
seriously never ever stand in this check in line
book directly with the hotel or use a reputable site
i also tried a chocolate dipped strawberry and my husband bought a lemon pound cake
the kielbasa sandwich was not good either as the sandwich was very dry
not very impressed and still didnt have a complete understanding of why they were justifying it but to be honest it didnt seem worth fighting over when we just wanted to throw some balls at some pins and the voucher was a few weeks from expiry anyways
i always look for a colorful gadget or 2 at wonderful prices
really a grab and go place
the treadmill has televisions included but they only have sportscenter espn and infomercials
i did like how fast they had the pictures ready
i had bad allergies due to the dust in the room
well i have made the suggestion to the waitress that they build a private plate licking room so that diners can lick the plates clean without everyone thinking they are nuts
so i walked around the building and asked her for two more
the clarendon is in theory a cool boutique hotel
10 min pai gow tables
i always try to stay clear of the fattening donuts and sandwiches but i cant resist the coffee cream and sugar
much better to save an email rather that jot notes
i love his work and would definitely recommend him for all categories of photos
there are a few stores where you can buy trinkets
only convenient because its attached to the tudor arms doubletree hotel
it is a bit isolated from the city but it is near everything that you could want mall grocery stores pharmacy
but if it were to be exactly imitated in a lessbusy part of town its the sort of place that would make me a bit worrisome about going in alone
its totally worth it
i also love the people of pittsburgh too
all the sides are good all the starters are good
really friendly and way less fake than most
this proved to be the best meal of our 14 day vacation in las vegas
not too chewy not overcooked
overall im not certain that i would stay here again
the bathroom was huge there was a vanity inside just in case one of us wanted to put on some makeupyeaaa right
my first review of this spot was really positive but over the years the service has declined
the apples on the trees were pretty small but the ones i tried after picking them golden delicious and red delicious had lots of flavor
ich htte mir vielleicht ein wenig mehr auswahl gewnscht ansonsten war es wirklich ein erlebnis
ive noticed when eating solo or within a group ticket times have been slow
i would say that if youre looking for a more full vegas experience ph is not where you want to stay
i highly recommend coming to check out a meeting or networking mixer
they seemed to care about overbooking and getting paid for green fees then pleasing their customers
i stayed for 7 nights due to construction in my apt
tommy pastrami is of of the great finds
they were dry and tasted a bit stale to be honest
after devouring a full plate of nachos
we had purchased a groupon for their wine tasting and purchased additional appetizers several bottles of wine and a wine stopper
would i stay here again
went with my girlfriend and had a blast
housekeeping still needs to be better trained they do not clean well
bed bugs mold blood on the floor for over 24 hours by ice machine elevator doors would not open or close all the way
overall nice hotel but go elsewhere
lots of food for the moneybruce is a great guy become a regular you will not be sorry
ive taken the kids here a couple times already but decided to finally write a review
the teasers i got so far have been out of this world i cant even believe thats me in the photos
the room and comfortable and the room service was great
every little touch of this hotel is for you and you feel it the moment you arrive
i absolutely plan on coming back
we also had the roasted peppers i probably wouldnt order that again
the restaurant and breakfast is a joke
and if you still have room for dessertyou must try the caramel creme bruleeit is amazing
sometime while watching these two cars my husband and i feel asleep in our rental car
just my two cents but i prefer the other hotels in town
very awesome game
everything that couldnt get past city planning in the french quarter made it to final permit here
will definitely be checking this place out again
but the acrobatics the set the action sequences are extraodinary
ive never been a big believer in the whole good things come in small packages thing and this bar isnt exactly huge
the chapel and hotel staff were all very professional and helpful
i will be headed back in to explore the rest of the menu for sure
i asked housekeeping if they had any other higher thread count sheets and they brought them right up
listenif you love creative theatre or entertainment that leaves you a better person for having experienced itthen bricolage is right up your alley
the service was extremely slow i think she was the only person besides the cook
luckily we were there the 5th and 6th so we made the 5 look like a 6 with a small stroke of pen and parked for free the next day as if we were reentering
we were impressed by all of the vendors and the communication between all parties was extremely clear
we were given some minor details and shown some pictures but had to ask a lot of questions to find out the important stuff
we ordered the clear sangria which was quite tasty and refreshing but a little expensive at 14
if i could make this a 0 star rating i would
this makes for a happy experience during the photo shoot
the rice is amazing
i hate this place
this hotel was perfect for my first time to las vegas
plenty of food choices
they have stuff that you really do not need to buy here but a lot of the stuff is cool
thank you for the good times sls
tram is walking distance
especially the caramel apple pecan pie
the isles are loaded with all kinds of decorations and themes different colors and combinations
beautiful suite facing fremont st was a little concerned about the noise level but since the noise stayed at the same level it wasnt an issue
i told her no she doesnt
the resort was booked well in advance and prepaid to get 20 discount
highly recommend this location
i didnt seem like the hotel was at max capacity and maybe that is why my checkin and check out experiences were so easy
checking in i didnt expect royal resort to say  welcome  whats your plan in vegas  perfect
its undisputed that frank lloyd wright came out to arizona to work on the biltmore but how much did he contribute
listed as best western plus charlotte matthews hotel in my reservation
we would use them for three hours
there is no selfparking only valet unless you park at aria but the walk carrying your luggage wouldnt be fun
emerys is a valued treasure in henderson
awful customer service
deff use her if planning a trip to vegas
we sat down in the restaurant with my young child only to be told that in order to have the happy hour specials we needed to be sitting on the other side of the restaurant
attended an event here
good size and price for the area
im not an angry bride my wedding day was actually the best day of my life i just want other brides to know like i did what they were getting when they book shenandoah
our server at first seemed pretty uptight but after he decided to pay attention to us he was nice
the owners are so friendly and laid back
then we get our room later that afternoon and it was still incorrect with only one bed when we needed two  so their we go with our our luggage down to the lobby again and wait some more
the stage is amazing performing on a vertical platform at most times
th fireplace and heated bathroom floor were turned off for the season it was 63 but it was also 55 degrees that night the bed sheet came off the bed on all sides there was only decaf coffee and when we called thy brought us 2 packets  2 cups  of caffeinated coffee
i loved the way the deck area overlooked the cuyahoga and the east bank of the flats
tired old gal in the heart of the city          our tour group leader uses this hotel for his tours of the areathe hotel is located right in the heart of the city
never been disappointed once
a few friends and i had the pleasure of staying one night in room 720the room leone jensen stayed in
this is a great place to enjoy a fantastic top notch dinner with an excellent view of our beautiful city
our suite was on the 19th floor and we had more than enough space for two
fresh fruit all around
i was already thinking about trying to save room for the entire meal
maybe it was our small stack that made you ask questions
used to be a daily customer since my school was near there
we ordered food from librettos and brought it up to howl who was happy to provide plates napkins and utensils for us
therefor paying customers are walking out the door  this dilemma could be solved with making sure the lines move quickly and efficiently
the beds were luscious and cozy
that evening we enjoyed an amazing dinner at prado their on site 5 star restaurant complete with an amazing dessert and happy anniversary message drom the chefs and headed back to our room to enjoy our anniversary evening
cosmo is right across the street and if i ever need anything walgreens is also located at planet hollywood
i was so excited and surprised as i had been hinting that i wanted to try this place for months and raved about how many good things i heard about it
as the sun began to set on mt
the corn bread is slightly sweet with a great corn meal
though it wasnt as crowded as before
so much can go wrong when with a large group of guys trying to get into a nightclub
i had a delicious vegetable soup and artisan salad
buffalo chicken egg rolls are amazing
i think i go to the distillery district just for the jane corkin gallery and balzac coffee  it was a chilly afternoon but the area was lit up with the afternoon golden light
i love excalibur its a freaken castle come on and u cant get better deals then this i researched
the starbucks in the establishment was literally steps away from the conference room my business meeting was in  a huge bonus
these ladies attitude and sense of customer service not only left a fantastic impression on me but made me love w scottsdale a bit more than other local hip hotels
shops you are literally steps away from the shops
the pool area was very nice and again clean clean clean
we love this place
ive seen this in other hotels and it cuts down on check in times
the stratosphere is the best casino in vegas
i will be back for more fun times
at least talk to me while you take my money
im sure this hotel has enough staff to put on duty for registercheck in
in addition to this the service was very good
wrong thing to tell me as i am mexican and it just not true
i finally went and took my shower but heres the worst part
we paid around 12000 plus taxes at trump and for the room and the view we got it was totally worth it
they were glazed on the outside but the way they were cooked left them a bit mealy on the inside
conclusion this is a very nice hotel for the folks that dont want to be in the middle of it all on the strip the gambling is decent and although this hotel is geared toward the older generation you and your family can have fun
if you dont get a chance to ever stay here you must go and at least try the buffet
that seems to be her goto response to just get rid of folks
for how long she couldnt say and i asked if i could try again saturday morning when people checked out but she said they were fully booked that day as well
i only stayed here one night but from that i could tell that i like this place
i didnt like the wooden window shuttersblocked a lot of light
mercaditos just opened and soon hearthstone to follow they are sure to last
it is almost too big to walk to all the elevator corridors
fried chicken had a piece that was not fully cooked and bloody near the bone
the hotel is nice doesnt look like an old hotel
it was great
i wish we had done that now
location location location sums up this hotel pretty nicely
ill never stay here again unless its free for work again
again i already loved it here
first we check in as soon as we get to our floor it smelled unpleasant we head up to our hotel
we were a party of two one man and one woman
the rooms are very large
there was just the right amount of smoke and the meat was tender giving just enough chew to pull off the bone they were delicious
here its 80 dollars for 10 visits
auch freunden und bekannten haben wir von dem mangel an gastfreundschaft berichtet und auch viele dieser menschen werden knftig auf den besuch des strohguhotels verzichten
we also had kevin shoot our engagement photos and had a blast working with him
the food was excellent the service was excellent
the ph is a decent place to stay with friendly service
i had earplugs as a standard now for traveling
i know that because i have still not warmed upto dry red wines
the water from the tap was extremely cloudy i could not see through it when i filled the coffee pot so i suggest cleaning anything you use anyway including the coffee pot with bottled water before use
avoid this place at all costs
he can carry on with his call i can enjoy my magic showwe both win
we were still able to get up have a little toast and hang out but you could tell the other 3 tables in there with us felt really awkward about having to share their space with a party that they were clearly intruding on though it was no fault of their own
taxi cab lines these were the slowest cab lines in i have ever expeienced in vegas so bad i had to walk to other neighboring casinos to catch a cab whenever i needed a cab
took about an hour for 3 rolls to arrive they were extremely small and tasted bland
i am a local and decided to get away for the night as i had been wanting to check out the city center
miserable but luckily not a long ride
i truly liked my stay and this was a nice place
ugh savor life boring
the room was comfortable clean had a good sized fridge along with utensils and coffee
overall not worth the hassle
so goood and cheap i ate here 3 times during my 2 day stay
i have a 4 year old daughter and 5 year old son and they love these things at their birthday parties
went for a free time share weekend presentation  90 minutes arrived to long check in lines  room was not in the best shape  looked like someone had been there before we arrived  dirty empty cups and trash  beds looked like they were not made properly
take advice from a former chairman level player card gambler they have changed there machines and would bet my net worth vs a donut there machines are not on the up and up
it actually hurt to wash up
the front door had a gap of nearly 12 we could see thru the gap
good standard of hotel for short stays
regularly it is around 50
he kept our guests entertained and welcomed requests
the entire spa is definitely not updated
if you are short like i am this section really sucks
the desk staff was helpful and when we called for special requests from room service they quickly provided what we requested
every time someone visits from out of town i bring them there
the taste was great but for 18 the portion was more like a small appetizer
well trojans won so im happy
if you havent been here you need to try it out
be sure to sign up for the grazie card  one of the perks is free internet which is otherwise 10day
long story short theyve won our business back
let me tell you this place is definitely overhyped
i would come back but it wouldnt be my first choice
they were very nice and quick even doing turn down service
at first i was worried about the location  30 taxi ride to the strip
i wipe your hair from your face and lean over to kiss you
the buffet quality has gone way down
he got us onto the hakkasan guest list to see calvin harris tickets were about 120 per person fyi
the lightning fast response  you can but its after 6pm so youll have to pay for the room anyway
i took my two kids here a few days ago and must say i had a fantastic time
kenny our server was also very attentive and friendly
and my fingers hurt now
entering the duce it is pretty cool to walk into the outside
headline for true rock n roll fans this is a must see even for a bandwagon enthusiast like myself this museum was interesting
connected to the marketplace is splurge a homemade gelato shop that will satisfy your sweettooth the gelato is all natural and the flavors always change they even have an adultonly root beer float and dont forget to indulge in some of the retro candy they sell
i will definitely be back
this winery 101 bartenderhost  was rude and  handled a situation very unprofessional
do not wear a costume
however one thing i could have changed in this particular trip is my choice in exchange
at least they are nice and wash their hands
staff was warm and friendly but not intrusive
but from a happy hour standpoint i worked all day 10 hours
as i was picking up my take out i saw staff talking with the eat in customersthat was cool
watch out for the door man with butter teeth
positive the price of the room was good
one time a friend and i was stopped by one of the time share reps as we were walking around so we stopped to talk to them and actually signed up for the presentation because one of the gifts were 200 in promotional chips
i hit up the sweet tea while i waited about five minutes for my food to be ready and its decent
almost at the front of the line when i look at jerry and say lets get four
there is a long delay from one station to another
oh and the 295 mystery beer in a paper bag
would definitely use again in the future
for crying out loud i was in the venetian and beers were 300 for a full bottle  here theyre 700 so you know whatthe more i write and think about it its a freaking 2 now
the ll and other fast food hawaiian spots cant compare
i enjoy venturing out to other resorts in vegas but would love to stay here again
however after we got in and he left the disaster started
the canvases are all predrawn to ease any worries about painting skill
i hate the layout completely
mal was anderes dachte ich schon bei der ankunft die jungs und mdels an der rezeption sahen mit den roten hosentrger auf schwarzen klamotten schick und witzig aus
gelato ice cream was favorite part and that was  out sourced
weve all been there also right outside the hotel are several fine dining options to choose from
great place to stay you dont have to walk through the smoke filled casino and the staff makes sure it stays relatively quiet
i highly suggest contacting chris  maria for your transportation needs
atmosphere is fun always neat to come with friends
separate bedroom with a bed there and then a foldout sofa in the sitting area
however the food is terrible through their catering department
the room we got was perfect for us  a king suite with a view of the strip
good thing i took the extra from the hotel the day before
gorgeous views hiking available behind the property and really awesome dining
we walked over from aria to gamble here a bit and get a change from our home casino
the casino floor was calling to me with its flashing blinking beeping lights and sheer prospect of winning big
we were seated pretty quickly but it was 8 minutes before our server said hello even though it appeared he only had two other tables
its nice has a list of fine restaurants and amenities and good reputation
we paid this money in good faith and expected a wedding
the staff was extremely helpful with accommodating our needs and the wedding was perfect
no comforter on bed
the kale was very flavorful i wish there had been more of it
the cookie sandwich was great but our guest experience was really a bummer
more bar available
for as gritty  hometown a feel as the restaurant aims for i expected the same of the symposium  the rest of the tour which i was surprised to find was not the case
valet was a nightmare
if this is going to be your first visit go there with an open mind and know its a little over priced
let me break it down for you the facility very clean with modern and brand new amenities
anyway when you are inside you dont really know where to start because its big but just keep walking and make your path
the owner originally quoted the work and was very professional knew his craft well
this was our 4th different hilton property in a week and the best of the bunch
find my room but there isnt even a closet for my clothes but two hooks with hangers
that is good because not many places you can walk to with ease
all i could think being from detroit was and they always knock us for vacant run down buildings
avoid at all costs
there was no free wifi
overall if you want the best sports book experience especially during football seasonthis is the place to be
i ate it all
so let me cut to the chase heres their solution
the pool area is niceour room was given to us with all sorts of problems
i would give more stars cause i like the food but the service needs to improve
come on palazzo management
the food was aces as well we enjoyed the ribs the brisket and the sausage
if you like historic hotels with ghost stories youll love it here
taylor is so creative and professional
99 cent only store is my favorite
definitely not a place i would want to stay all night
wanted to use hideabed
worst experience ever
why is it off to the side
i am a frequent here at both the hotel and mandalay bay but this weekend changed that indefinitely for good
not as good as a top notch bbq joint but decent
she chose lacma for our location and were planning to take some fun photos
kevins designs are beautiful modern and look very rich
doesnt have that normal nasty cigarette smell like most hotels do
this noisiness is the primary reason we dont give this hotel a higher rating
drinks and food looked good by menu descriptions but i cant tell you whether they were any good
topped lunch off with strong pink cocktail and voila  yes i will be back
one morning i walked out of our room and there was a black out on the floor
i would stay here again
everything was well again
the outdoor seating area is ample and nicely enclosed
our server brittney was very attentive and nice
i have sent the restaurant a private message as well shall see if we hear back
people left hungry
i loved them both
its rather small inside but there are several roomsmini studiossetups to choose from for your photo shoot
the bus stop for the strip bus and the bus to the outlet malls is pretty close by
we also met a host on the floor who gave us our mlife cards right there and helped us out with advice
it was my first time staying at this hotel
yet another good experience at the luncha libre truck
cant be greedy though
roast beef was dry the au jus  showed up after everyone had half their dinners eaten
it had rice butter chicken palak paneer tomato some onions cucumber some kind of lentilbean thick soupy kinda sauce
pommes frites auch typisch indisch
the gym is great
after we finished the salad i  could only eat one piece of chicken there are 3 in this dish so i had them wrap it up along with the leftover bread from the bread bowl
also across tropicana ave is a free monorail that stops at the three casinos south of tropicana
i had the cornish hen and polenta as my entree the polenta was delicious and the cornish hen was not so bad
i should have complained but i really wanted to just enjoy vegas
1 for what can be considered a small at mcd
watch out for flying claydirt if youre sitting on the front row
there are plenty of other places in the city to go if you plan on spending mucho cashola where the overall experience is much more satisfying
have won other times
will go back again
this is for the casino only
this place has a nice environment going for them as its more relaxed and less crowded than most places on the vegas strip however the service is ridiculously slow on a nonbusy night
not only friendly but each person would look you in the eye as they spoke to you
could you introduce on with actual spice
my wife and i were happy that we were able to find people who understood what we wanted as picky as we were and were totally flexible in changing things
as were shower caps the morning after
everyone has said that but i will just reiterate
i have noticed it seems like a trend now
none of these by themselves is a big deal but when the entire experience is riddled with let downs its just become unacceptable for what is supped to be an upper scale hotel
the beach scene with the crab puppets was so funny the music is on point with every scene and the whole experience is enhanced with builtin speakers on your seats headrest
so over 400 later the joke was on us
maybe you could have mentioned that when we called two weeks ago to give you a heads up we were coming
we booked 3 nights over the new year when we walked in the place looked pretty decent that all changed when we got the keys to a pyramid room we opened the door and were immediately hit in the face with humid air that smelled like old dirty socks
the 2 full bathrooms saved us a ton of time when it came to getting ready
the room felt cramped
absolutely love it and recommend to anyone no matter what side of town you live on especially if youre into hawaiian food
we talked to 3 different people and they all gave us horrible directions
i love coming here for brunch or dinner
plus the whole of fremont street is a short 2 minute walk away so theres even more old school vegas debauchery to be had without cabbing it
first of all how the hell am i being charged for parking when theres absolutely no parking spots
the only thing to keep in mind is parking you can valet at ph and then trek through the mall with your bags which is the only way ive done it
i guess i must have pocketed them with the rest of my stuff during the conversation so now i will probably get charged on my card for those things to add to my misery something other customers have complained about in other reviews i read
not what your looking for if your planning an event or a wedding here which allot of people do here
if i was to spend my time and money dining out i would look elsewhere
i related my observations and experience to the front desk and that i was moving to their sister hotel
i thought they were going to be old and less fresh but they were fantastic
the brie alone would bring me back here
clean rooms extremely comfortable beds and the hotel itself is nice and offers several lounges and bars
cooked to perfection
little things in your room
the breakfast menu is limited yet i sat for several minutes before she came to take my order
the service is good the chips and salsa are great and the food is excellently consistent
yes it is part of the station group of casinos but is far upscale and is its own brand
as i was studying the menu httpwwwfoxrccomfrcwpwpcontentuploads201204littlecloefullmenupdf i ordered the cold shrimp and that came with an excellent horseradish cocktail sauce
who says that to a customer
the staff then provided us with chocolate truffles on the way out as well
my coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special
but that detroit hgi was awesome
the only thing was that it was kind of annoying having to pull out your room key everytime you want to get back to your room
at least wifi is included
i purchased the groupon deal and was able to book a last minute appointment
depends on what meal you get but it will last
we stayed there for a few days over valentines weekend and i must say we enjoyed ourself
the bed was just as comfortable
macncheese bar presentation wise this was the only slight miss by copper square nobodys perfect because i had requested they be served in martini glasses and put on my menus macncheese martini bar so the guests were probably wondering where the martinis were because they just had small plates but no biggie

my cousin ordered the strawberry banana french toast
what a wonderful pilar in our community
someone was banging on the door at 3am trying to get into their room
id say 10 and under
what made this even worse was the fact that not only wouldnt she let us view any of the pictures on the view finder she acted as though she was checking each one after it was taken for smiles and closed eyes but she was very wrong on those counts
so even though we got the hotel for 107 a night we paid 420 total with the fees and taxes
find another ring vendor
the rooms are spectacular and so is the pool bar lobby etc
included fitness center which was exactly what i needed
some of the desk staff not sure if you can rebuy they have to ask the boss he isnt sure he will just ignore please get your policies and procedures right
i feel like the dishes are fantastic but id love to have more veggies tossed in
the security guy acted like i was a huge inconveniencemaking it seem like i did something wrong and that everything was my fault
there is no exception to the no id rule  no matter how much white hair you have
when i paid them and said thank you they didnt even bother to say youre welcome like i owe them the money
absolutely love there flower arrangement i will continues to recommend them to all my friend and family
our favorite part of the meal
bonus it is right next to the private terminal at mccarran so getting from the airport to the hotel is going to be a breeze
asked for tea and was brought one cup of hot water and no refill
they called down to the warehouse and asked that it be brought pumas soon as it was delivered so i could begin to work
we each got a suite ranging from the 49th floor to the 59th floor
followed that with the stuffed pork loin that was served with asparagus spears and garlic mashed potatoes
biscuits were to die for
my room was immaculate
drinks are a decent price with the standard 5 for a tap beer
clean and comfortably appointed
you would think they would want to be more aware of their surroundings  people coming  going
if you have the energy i would suggest going over to the luxor buffet  it is much better
i love hanging out at gangplank
the margaritas were good but oh my goodness the dancing bear cocktail was by far the worst drink i have ever tasted in my life
omg this place sucked
the food  and desserts were everything i expected and more
onion rings were on point
thanks for a great time
we will be back for sure
jake was kind enough to fax a reversal over to my bank in california with minutes to spare because it was a friday at 545pm
apparently the bathroom is interesting so will need to check that out on our return visit
nothing to recommend
in the middle are three or four tables one with a lego theme one with an animal or little people theme and i cant remember the other one
last but not least taking a bite out of the fork tender beef was justuuuh fabulous
i really wish i could give a half star rating right now
the atmosphere is very comfortable and the food is really good
i learned the vdara is just an extension of the aria
theyre connected to the monorail if that helps
as we both ate our sandwiches sitting down outside we did not realize ice cream was leaking though the paper bag holders and ice cream leaked all over our hands pants and shoes
everything about this place is five steps up from your standard nail salon
first i am a female and i had an awesome experience at bondurant
but its doable
fantastic view over looking the water show
the first thing i spotted was a stainless steel pizza tower on one of the booth table
there is even a rooftop where parties are often held
everything was exceptional
anthonys steakhouse is by far the best restaurant in las vegas area
the sls seems to be focused on the movers and shakers and is priced accordingly
service was a bit slow but this isnt a place you go to for a quick meal
one of the best places ive ever stayed at
the room i stayed in came with a mini fridge that was empty so i was able to put my alcohol in there rather than having to put it in an ice bucket
i have to say that this hotel casino is beautiful
i came here with three friends for four nights
conveniently we stayed at venetian on the 10th floor during our trip so we literally walked across the hall to the restaurant
but overall extremely awesome affordable place for a younger crowd and i wouldwill definitely stay there again
glass black brown and wood is best way to describe it
the light was flickering off and on
needless to say we did not give up and we found another place called graceland chapel the opposite direction down the road
die qualitt entschdigte jedoch dafr
this goes down on my vegas where to stay list
i cant wait to go back and see it again
it just seems that its even higher than the norm
shes a gem
just spent almost a full week at  gvr  not a bad facility if you like to gamble
our most recent visit 82415 took awhile to get our food
the candied yams with home made marshmallow topping were almost a dessert
my friend ordered the truffle fries and it didnt seem to be worth it small portion even if the flavour was good
the foodand the servicewere a
the staff throughout our entire stay was extremely nice and very helpful
well i do have fond memories of this hotel from 16 years ago but this trip was the reality check that it has aged in the not so gracefully way
one of the two rooms had a mini fridge right in the middle of the floor
after dealing with airports flights luggage rental cars and traffic for the past 10 hours we wearily entered the circus circus hotel lobby wanting nothing more than sleep
i do not have long hair so certainly not mine from yesterday
staff were friendly and they have a pretty decent dinner menu
my wife really enjoys the ice service
i enjoyed my stay inside as much as i did outside
signature dishes make you want to come back
and this location did a darn good job of it
frankly a big b
i ordered the basic chicken sandwich and my wife got the spicy chicken sandwich
not really sure what we paid for
never had a bad meal and have visted 10 times
we talked about the passion behind the food the idea of the restaurant and the man who was behind it
40 minutes to get 2 drinks 1 beer and 1 glass of wine
favorite part was the remote controlled curtains
the drapes did a bad job of keeping the daylight where it belonged  outside
you must try the tacos
how ever the new room we had been relocated to smelled very weird and the only way the smell would die down is if we kept the air conditioning on high
that cost me 1500 not happy i went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day
i had to move the next day to the room i had booked originally
dont miss this
went back here with my grandparents and mom for my grandma to gamble while me and grandpa and mom went to the adventuredome
the aria  the vadara have the same amenitys and we plant to stay there this coming june
you would feel conflicted  2ask the chef to see the smoker
there was a desk and the chair was comfortable
hotel was lovely staff was very friendly room service always arrived on time and the hotel was extremely clean
pros 1  great breakfast
housekeeping does not miss a beat which is rare in most hotels
mirrors will get you mirin yourself   distance 45 mins away from clubs located at far north end strip like xs and ebc
no matter if it is for a bachelorette party weddings special occasions guests visiting out of state or for just a weekend of fun you need to have this vegas experience
hope the dinner fare is better
you have to go down to the coffee shop in the hotel if you want coffee in the morning or pay a ridiculous amount to have coffee brought up via room service
they have las vegas best buffet studio b buffet an oyster bar two steak houses and a day spa
i had better service at a motel 6
i am vegan so finding somewhere to eat is difficult sometimes
i always get the feeling that the wait staff does not want you to be there
hopefully vegas management will get their act together
okay in retrospect i probably didnt need that butter and it probably would have caused me to eat even more bread which i definitely didnt need
it was a night club restaurant and karaoke bar in one
the security manager informed us that perhaps it hadnt been turned in yet and left in their basement  where there is no reception
i would definitely recommend this place to those who have never been before
when he was all done then they brought the fixings for the bake potato along with the crab legs
we got here a bit late my bad  i figured shows would start late as they typically do in sf but we still managed to be able to see the show
the pickles are delicious and there is an extremely wide selection of mustards to choose from
gorgeous inside    poolbeach closes at 700    middle of the night room service nachos    wait for everything is a bit long but when you get the service its great  had a little issue mentioned it without screaming or complaining or even asking for it they compensated us more than we expected
service has been hit or miss
and she was just as competent as carry
they still have a few glitches to work out but thats to be expected in a brand new hotel
they go down to about below my rib cage so they would also easily fit small children
im sitting outside  i feel utterly disillusioned
movie theater is nice nothing special
i appreciate that kind of personal attention and you can rarely find it anywhere
i figured they were trying to go for a outdoor maybe country vintage look but it looked like the tables were falling apart
means it will take you twice as long to get clean than it should especially if you have a lot of hair
handmade pancooked they
the penne salad was very good and it was a nice small portion just the right size
much quicker this way
i have been stalking this food truck for quite some time
tour guides in buggies cant negotiate in the narrow trails so often he had to get out of the buggy and walk back
so we feel like we are somewhat experienced about what makes a good casino
bottom line if youre a bro or woo girl who just wants to get blackout drunk with your brosbtches in vegas you will probably love it
it took another 10 or 15 minutes for that task to be accomplished
they are also kinda scattered around
all were excellent but the sweet potato tortellini took the prize as the most original and delicious dinner
we go here every summer for the picnics
i finished it before going back to my room
glad that there were 5 of us so we managed to bring all our belongings to our room on the 2nd floor
we just dont like people walking in to where our things are
and no freakin resort feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
moist tender n just plain yummy
you lost me
about 20 gets you some really good quality food a huge variety free unlimited beerwine great dessert selection and a cool environment to enjoy it all in
she could have used the empty end of our tattle and avoided needing to know how to distribute weight evenly
it was disappointing to say the least
this is the first one i wanted to book a return visit
so if you have seen other cirques it is a little different but fun to go on a ride with the imperial twins as their search for each other
i would go back
very well trained stallions
2 the selection of television channels was very limited
i recently discovered this store and have already been back twice
i never eat garlic bread but theirs was so delicious i could have had seconds
hope i get back there someday in the future
i cant imagine anyone capturing the event better than aaron did
definitely staying at the palazzo next time
these 3 things along with the scenic views made my trip amazing
but even on my online booking receipt said nothing about me booking a non smoking room
the pool is not exclusive to ocatilla guests as no one monitors the area so you have people who pool hop who shouldnt be there
the servers were all nice enough but the service was very poor
minus the coffee since starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here
my friends who were visiting us in our room staying at other properties were also impressed
seriously i fell asleep so quickly i didnt even have time to continue enjoy being drunk
he found two nonsmoking room one with a king and one with two queens which at this point was fine with us because we wanted to be done with this process already
again im sure you can get one if you ask
she asked all the right questions to make sure we had a great stay
when i explained she said she could give me a 50 foodbeverage comp  not really useful when our only meal at the hotel was going to be the buffet
it is clear copperfield is squeezing all he can out of this vegas gig and using the mgm and vegas pr machine to overhype his show
i paid 18 for my 2 year old the cashier said no problem shes 2 we gave the host are receipt to seat us and said we had to pay for my daughter because shes 2 going on 3 shell be 3 in a few months so she insisted
so my brotherinlaw got in the car and drove back to the establishment
the crisy bacon with the juicy pork tenderloin combined with that barley risotto in some brown sauce was all it took to numb my vocal chords to prevent from wasting all that energy on talking rather than putting it to use to chew  savor my meal
very classy and well maintained
considering i was there for a week i tried them out anyways
thats all i expect
if you are quesadilla purist like me you will enjoy it too
i cant speak for the staff as i didnt come in contact with them
when i let them know they were super rude and fought me on it
we felt very rushed and the photographer with cashman was extremely gruff and disorganized
rare fish staples omakase etc
the restaurant was packed when we came here on tuesday but we were seated promptly and our orders were taken on a fairly quick amount of time
thank you jamie for going out of your way to help us today
no fridge in the room but you can have them send one up for a fee
on the strip and a monorail stop
excellent selection of pay per view movies including many that are only out at the cinema at present
i am looking forward to my next visit to party with paint
having penns vodka and greek salad
the only thing you cant sign for here is love and happiness although i bet you can rent it for an hour or two
this has always been a must to on my list when visiting vegas
lastly their assorted sushi is good
we will likely seek out some fine tuning but honestly they dont need much help
the bathrooms were filthy too
the hotel has a plentiful and fresh breakfast along with great coffee
so all in all spend a little more and stay away from the luxorno luxury at this place
the hotel was nice and clean
and it was 630pm    i felt my steak was a little bit overcooked maybe cuz my steak was smaller so ended up with medium well instead of medium rare but other than thatit was ok appetizer and dessert nothing too special at regular price you will get the 6 oz small steak for 45 only so i think it is worth it to go for summerlicious and winterlicious though i wished they could improve on their appertizers offeringalso liked the service toothe bread that comes with the food  very good  plus bonus they have round tables too for big groups  also if you are ordering your steak well done make sure to ask for the option of  butterflying your steak
i asked for salt to be delivered and extra ice with the meal
overall i give it 3 stars and for the unique theme and shops but docked them for the parking internet and exercise room
he seemed like almost bothered to be there
we also confirmed that we could get two adjoining rooms confirmed this on two different calls directly with the female desk agent at the hotel
there were a lot of people waiting for the food it was taking a while for the eggs and sausage to come out and when it did because there were so many people waiting the trays were emptied before everyone could get some
oh and maybe that this wasnt far from the parking garage
just hit the turn signal and stop on in
well dont let looks deceive you
and the freshly baked bread i saw a eclair that looked good so i thought why not try itit should be goodit was all right i would at not time go out of my way for it
we sat outside because it was a beautiful day and there was a man standing at the host station
that was the first one
the rooms are nice and the people that work at the mgm grand are really nice
it was once my wifes and i favorite place to stay in vegas
we were upgraded to a suite for our stay and it was incredible
the next day they fixed the lights  but then they broke again sometime before we left hahahahaha
he was nice enough though
caesars paris linq the linq is very similar to paris as far as my overall stay went
have booked a room
he said they didnt have gluten
the food here is definitely subpar the rooms smell and the curtains are stained
we all gave it a thumbs down and agreed it would not be worth it to come back
of course you should expect to pay some money to eat here but it is worth every penny
not moon though
there were different types of performances other than the typical acts
construction above us or next to us began around 630700am
i have no intention of staying and playing anywhere else on my future visits to vegas
my friend got the london fog which is an earl grey tea with homemade lavender which was pretty delicious
free shuttles took me to and from the places that were a little too far to walk but much of oakland was a 1015 minute walk away
the service always seems very rushed and unorganized
you could tell that it was all family and friends as the wait staff invited some of them to the kitchen then several times the chef came out and visited this may be why our two entrees took 45 minutes to get when there was only one table of two waiting for food when we got there
now i know where to go when im in vegas
pretty positive it was the buffet food
in my book thats a plus in this place was ok the room was on the smaller side and a bit outdated
tracy is the absolute best and our bartender brenda was also incredible
chicken donuts  no need to say more
but considering how far off it was from the strip i honestly wasnt expecting much and figured its just a spot for the locals
i have challenged this and again no word back
the microwave and mini refrigerator come in handy
the property features a restaurant a sports bar pool fantastic patio comfortable and spacious rooms and a really friendly staff
you could tell they were proud of the product
there were more guests that was anticipated so some of us had to wait a while for a place to sit
the open sign was off and the blinds were covering all the windows so it looked like they werent open but they were
so far my stay has been horrible
keep up the great work
one needs good moisturizer in the desert the rooms arent fancy but comfortable with a small couch and a coffee table
it was definitely a nice place to hang out and pregame and just chill
he spoke very highly of eric and said that he offered exemplary service
but from seeing people coming out looking like they had a good time seems worth it
35 stars for the price
the russian dressing turned out to be a stellar mild combo with the medium strength of the cheddar and of course bacon is delicious
nice location 1block off the strip
filet and i finished every little bit
im not sure if someone with the same name as me has had an issue but i am sure i have never stayed at the cosmopolitan in my life
who cares because in this bunker of a pub you will lose track of all
think it was about 40 a night
my coworkers were completely satisfied with the smoked meats and sides
other than that everything was great
the website is very informative it has pictures so it can give one ideas and it gives you instructions on how to order and what to consider
it was seriously fun and i would recommend that ride to other thrill seekers
good close to malls and restaraunts
i planned a bachelorette party and took a group of girlfriends here
but nobody should ever go here because of authenticy
just fyi for those of you who didnt its about 100 dollars to order the fight
i sorry but your choose to be a server then you need to be better at serving people and be aware of what your tables need
plus i love how late theyre opened so if youre craving indian at those guiltylate hours this is the goto
housekeeping wasnt up to par
so this is mine and my bfs go to bar for ufc fights and sporting events
i asked about a refund since it had already been too late in the day to continue any ride
last time i went through pittsburgh i stayed downtown at sheraton square and paid 2x as much plus an extra 20 for parking and dealt with horrible rush hour traffic
was such a relaxing place that we went back the next day to try the hookah
shelley was absolutely fantastic to work with the entire time i was in the store
the brioche was overly salty and not at all what i was expecting
not sure what that could be
the salt water pool is a dream to layout in during the summer
food was ok service ok beautiful space which makes for a really special time
he didnt want to explain anything to us and just hands over a piece of paper for us to read about our stay
not a hotel review the bar is awesome
i use a wheelchair and it never takes me more than a few minutes to get anywhere on the property
excellent selection and prices
day 1 reserved the 2 bedroom 2 story penthouse at vdara check in time is suppose to be 3pm i called ahead at noon to let them know i am on my way so get the room ready but i ended up having  to get in line over and over again to try checking in 5 times
the same trip costed me 20 on a cab
cons limo was a little late not that big of a deal we were just really excited to get there also there is a little dirt lot that is next to the chapel that is kinda ugly
i joked with my husband that i could happily live here
if you use this offer you dont know how much money youve to pay for
my biscuit was very solid and tasted quite good
price wise both concerts were reasonable too
not even close
but space wise they are quite good
honestly what is the point of hiding the checkin
i have been here several times  have always enjoyed it
maid service did a grea job straighting up each day
this is one of those places you want to love really bad but it just doesnt hit the mark
went to this establishment thinking they sold khakis realized when i got there they meant cakes
he doesnt over exaggerate what he can offer and has great follow through
just went to a party that had a balloon twister and face painter
the manager came to each table to say hi and to make sure everything was great
when you say vegas weddingpeople think of chapels with elvis or the hotel specialsnot uswe went with the lakeside with beautiful garden
when we asked a few questions about preparation they were just a bit too snooty
we went to the 17 south restaurant to eat and one of my friends paid with 100 bill and the waiter gave him the change for a 20 he kept the rest for himself or at least tried to but he went to him and had to demand the money
he never even acknowledged any of the mistakes
we stayed in the park avenue room with a view of the roller coaster
ive been here twice in a row with my bf for our anniversary and when they found out it was our second time celebrating with them they gave us champagne and a dessert on the house
wanted to come here after the great reviews on yelp
when a newly wed couple comes to vegas over all other possible destinations they expect a little more than your regular trip
honestly except for the fact that the guy checking us in had no idea what he was doing no real complaints
when i told the clerk about the problem with my card she didnt seem surprised and offered no apology
ive dealt with renaissance on many occasions so i am a return customer
toilet didnt have a door
came here last night for the grand opening
the shower curtain had dried idontknowwhat on it
breakfast is awesome
it was wonderful sitting in this beautiful sunlight room dipping the delicious beignets into the warm nutella
the pictures were amazing and the ceremony absolutely lovely
a lot of what was suppose to be available wasnt
it has been 3 weeks and i have not heard back from them
the in hotel restaurant had excellent food not too over priced and nearby restaurants were also fantastic
food was delicious
thank you for the perfect day guys
this is definitely one of the worst locations to get your pizza
obnoxious music as loud as it could be
i went and browsed and got something to eat
i was preparing to be late to work and all
the bartenders were really friendly made awesome drinks and the video poker was very kind to me
it was sparse selection
not a bad hotel
that was the worst customer service we have ever had and the fact that she did not care if we were happy or not i am just shocked
i spoke to the front desk agent who was less than friendly and completely unhelpful about my concerns was not forthcoming with information or suggestions about why a raucous party was going on without any mention of it being made during my reservation this was a random weeknight
i think if the service was just ok instead of being so unrefined i would be inclined to give this four stars
comes with music and lights
ive taken my group here before for a small little xmas event and everyone loved it
it is the mecca of baccarac
there are lots of smokers but when you leave there you wont feel like second hand smoke is killing you like most older casinos
the chair in the room even had a stain that they just flipped the cushion
total about face  the mystic paradise that was envisioned
my table started with chips and queso as an appetizer
this one was just not the experience i was expecting
so when we arrived we were immediately bombarded by someone trying to get us a time sharedude ive been up since the crack of dawn and just had to fly almost 4 hours  let me check in first
enjoyed the view of the eiffel tower the most
my water glass was never more than halfempty
also something really nice was that they day we checked out we went downstairs to leave our suitcases with the front desk because our plane didnt leave until 7pm and the front desk guy offered to extend our checkout until 4pm
i remember this as little kid
the main floor which contains the checkin reception lounge a second lounge with a fireplace bar and a pool table is clearly new
on another notehousekeeping did come by with a complimentary bottle of water the evening we were there
the rooms as small but very well appointed
i have very hit or miss experiences with this place
its pretty awesome
that was very disappointing
it had fresh fruit in it which i loved
the employees have no idea whats going on
oh i forgot to mention the terrible hawkers who hassle you at every entrance
if you dont care where you sleep because youre downstairs playing most of the time and do not care about an updated hotel then this place will do
before we ordered my dining companions had a mathheavy conversation about whether two small pizzas or one large pizza was going to be a better deal
did not see if they had a poker section
they should probably label themselves as an adult only place
that shouldnt have been a problem since the restaurant downstairs is ranked as one of the best in phoenix
stop in and see for yourself
the venue is definitely nicer than the club in that area
i took my boyfriend to carpe diem for his birthday dinner
everything from the rooms down to the casino floor
maria and sonia in housekeeping were wonderful as well
the next morning i take a shower before the conference and its luke warm
shouldnt that be their job
the flavors here are exceptional and i could eat there food on a daily basis
we got a room with double beds both of them were horrible very hard to sleep on
both sandwiches were just alright but the capreses refreshingness  simplicity was the better of the two
let me start by saying wheres the meat
if you dont mind walking down 14 flights filled with used condoms empty beer cans and trash theyre a great option
should have listened
great roof top vibe
we reached there by 1130 am and were wondering whether we had to wait till 3 pm for checkin
ive also heard that their massage services are a too though i havent had the luxury to try
they boast 4 pools  a kids pool
the only issue we had with the villa was since we were having a bachelor party there was that we needed ice for our drinks
half of which im kicking myself for the lack of picture was fat
i said i was staying here and he said you need to go all the way to the left
only 510 people having smokes then we get in and pay 30 but i realize ground floor isnt even open and lights are on  weird but okay  we come upstairs its half empty the people that were there were underaged we felt like we came to a grade 9 birthday party it was actually pretty disturbing the photographer was so bored walking around because he had no people to take pictures of he ended up coming up to 3 young girls wanting to photograph them but the girls told him oh no sorry our parents cant know where we are  that was a red flag to us i understand that people nowadays get fake ids but common how stupid are your bouncers that they dont realize when a girl is 1415 years old
the only downside is its location
even as a smoker when i went to vegas the smoke in the air really got to me and id have to leavenow it seems to really get filtered out
beautiful and great for conventions
nicely prepared and plentiful
i stayed in the west wing not facing the strip and i wouldnt recommend it
when we picked up the bbq the rackssterno was left out
the deal was good and the food portion wad a lot we took food home so thats always a good thing
after all free is free right
manager at the cash made sure everything was right
they also have a bowling alley and movie theater
positive was that the restaurant for dinner was excellent
empty condom wrapper in the corner of the room along with old dusty candy
the food and the service were outstanding
unfortunately my stay two weeks ago causes me to leave a poor review
we loved the renaissance
the salad was decent although the dressing was a little on the sour side
bellagio is for the sexy classy people
after another ten minutes of waiting they finally took our food order and brought us bread
they apparently count the pullout sofa as a bed
i guess so
clean modern and in a good location
seemed like an odd choice  for  dessert we ordered the mud pie to go
the michael jackson impersonator really touched my heart
yes you pay for them here and yes its the same anywhere else but i love it when its fresh
my kids attended the summer kids camp and had a great time
since their company is very cheap they have a very small expense allowance
mandarin oriental is luxurious elegant and professional
its personal attention that makes the difference in this industry
there is no where else in the hotel where its quiet enough for a phone call
i met them after they checked in and we had 2 free cocktails each while we comfortably caught up on our lives
when i arrived i definitely knew this is a petok vicinity people were walking their dogs everywhere and more dogs are seen in the cars while customers were checking in
when you first pull up you park in a dirt lot
overall pleased with my stay
his name was billy  i liked billy  well i call management jeremy and went down to fill out the form
its never been vacuumed
super friendly late check in very cleanvery
i didnt try streaming any video so im not sure if its strong enough for that
we booked a deluxe room and asked for a late check in
too many staff did not know answers to how the club cards work how to play points or cash in on comps
wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place
it had everything we wanted and more there was a safe and a fridge underneath the credenza
plus they have dicks last resort
i really wish you didnt have to pay a 25 per day fee to use it
i loved this place until i met gretchen
i was impressed by the selection of plants at kleins  there were rows and rows of healthylooking unique plants
no bellman is evident so you will schelp it all yourself
it must be an everyday occurrence for her because we said something to our waitress and it without naming names and she said oh you must be talking  about lindsey
ive always enjoyed this place and happy to eat there but this time almost makes me not want to go back
a girl can dream cant she
we went shopping at the mall and worked up a good appetite for our feast
security did respond rather quickly and caught him
i wasnt asking for anything difficult
update even the paid service tends to be on the slow side
plus inside this location my cell phone works so i can listen to pandora or even text my friends and most of all check in  give tips on yelpcom oh yeah they get five stars from me
located in the heart of download cleveland this hotel is very old but huge
since checkout at the hostel is at 10am and my flight was not until the late afternoon i had inquired upon making my reservation if it was possible to store my luggage in the front desk office in the interim period so that i could run some last minute errands and enjoy some last moments in madison
its really too bad
instead the clerk helping us had to keep walking into the back room to have a telephone conversation with this person
it was very light
the plate was emptied so i assume that she liked it also
they are extremely low cost and offer huge serving sizes
again no introductions nor welcoming us nor explaining the menu he was simply taking our order
all the bartenders and other employees are top notch except one
theres a wagon in the lobby
also their potato latkas are also pretty good just make sure to get apple sauce and everything i have had on their breakfast menu was delicious
both were amazing
i got a 15 zappos gc
if you want privacy i suggest getting a hotel
the location of the hotel is definitely interesting but at least its near a lot of restaurants mortons roys buca di beppo to only name a few
but the pro shop is the best there is
good food for fast food and very friendly staff
just being in the lobby creeped us out
my boyfriend is pretty picky so we chose the melted tomato basil and warm ricotta bruchetta to start
but my above review will stand until i either have received a response from them or i go back to this location to see if its any better
the watermelon salad was well watermelons and a sprig of mint and red onions
the crust is delicate and flaky with the fillings varying by season
after venturing out for a couple of hours we returned to the hotel and headed straight for the food court
if price is a consideration or if youve lost your stash at the tables save time for a round out here
so much fun
the server was surprised we barely touched it and did not pack it
shhh they add bacon to the top of theirs which trumps my mothers creamy delights its everything a deviled egg should be and more
the house chickery sauce im not quite sure what it is but its not good
its a crowd pleaser bringing this to a party
totally screwed up the evening that my uncle had planned for us
i sent them back
i have stayed here twice and really like the property but i find they have some customer service issues
if you are looking for really great italian comfort food baked goods and dessert the you need to go here
if you want a party place with fancy rooms this place will not meet your needs  go too the venetian
the bar is a lovely place for a drink and cozy conversation
however breakfast was good and varied
free self parking  con had no 3g or 4g most days wifi was slow to non existent pool party blasts music during the day renovation 31515 so no front desk area and the place was under construction
i loved the intimate venue however the food was not very good
who thought this up
we got the same level room but were at the end of the hall more privacy but a long walk to the elevator with a little more floorspace
lenny uh wasted kids is something that happens when you have a hankering for ice cream
we got a standard one but upgraded it to being bigger
being from ohio im spoiled by no smoking laws indoors
walking some of the casinos is too much smoke  but the palazzo i barely notice it
this space is managed by wells fargo and they no longer book wedding receptions
but it was great and everyone at the party loved it
we left our do not disturb light on accidentally all day and came back to an unmade bed
the oasis waterpark has two large slides one smaller winding slide a nice long lazy river a wave pool as well as other swimming areas
juste un peu piquant et dlicieux
it is super user friendly and has food coffee and drinks available to you at all times in a kiosk in the lobby
he was asking for help of since he never did something alone and they were making fun of him because he didnt know how
the location is the only good thing about it in my opinion and the room prices
one childs nachos came first followed by anothers fries then the last three dishes came out all at once
i used to come all the time and the only woman who works here ana used to be friendly
been here many times and the sound was amazing
idk just wasnt as tasty as i hoped it would be it was okay
closing at 400 is kind of random to me
brooke and michael are perfectionists when it comes to their work and are a smaller business
we have filed a complaint with days inn supposed to hear back within 72 hours contacted the credit card company most likely having to cancel card and are looking into reporting to the better business bureau
other then that the hotel is really great and very clean
but since my convention was at the riviera i figured id just stay there rather than have to cab back and forth from another hotel
they made us feel like they were doing us a favor instead of them providing a service for us
if you plan to go a few times its best to get the membership
you have to paint several coats for the color to show up boldly and if you want to make fine designs and lines youre pretty much going to have to accept that youll probably never get anything near perfect
i went right to the basic breakfast food area bacon sausage eggs hash browns toast points and sausage gravy
maintenance and house keeping seems like they either dont care anymore photos will show
i dont understand how this can happen at an establishment of this class
we had a great view of the water show and we didnt even ask
went to the red rock resort casino for my 30th wedding anniversary
our plane was delayed so we ended up getting in really lateto late to go looking for restaurants so we ended up eating at lemongrass
the pancake machine was ok the sausage were just warm that is why they need a microwave
took the elevator back up and it didnt work
there were hundreds of families waiting to get into this egg hunt
its a disgrace for a company to expect a 50 min order for some sandwiches
still despite the temperature it was a solid accompaniment to the entire shared meal
i thought moon sucked
from initial arrival at the hotel there were some major flaws
and we did
i liked the house music that played from like 11am to 10pm it wasnt too loud like other reviews said it made the hotel seem festive and fun
the atmosphere is just adorable with a cute little bar towards the back
all in all ive had extremely average dining experiences in here
they kept telling us they are on the way and they never showed up
a few hours after eating we both started having terrible stomachaches and coughs
undoubtedly receiving vip treatment due to my friend arranging our stay we are definitely fans and will stay again
the gals at the make up counter were the best
ive stayed here a couple of times in the past and always thought it was okay
never disappoints and service within every area of hotel and service provider is spectacular
i sent her a few pictures of what i was looking for and she did an amazing job even better then what i sent her for my centerpieces
really yummy beans
this place represents cool and adds to the great funkiness of the distillery district
first of all the customer service was the worse i have ever experienced in my life
better than the restaurants outside
one has had no sleep because she was terrified that someone tried to break into her room
yeah the strip club was right next to it so who knows what type of griminess has stayed in that room
im not a connoisseur when it comes to wine but it balanced out well with my meal
they asked when we checked in i said no
if you ask me he is taking a fine establishment and making it into a fst food joint
however once i tried the grapes just felt like they can melt in your mouth and i kept on buying papayas from hawaii
how dare they charge a resort fee
people look for another place i read the reviews and did not pay attention i thought this cant happen to me
but the place is not close to the strip and is for those people who want a relaxing time
fun evening can buy a picture of yourself for only 50 food was so so
either way the decor is really cute very ikeaesque with a bit of funky 60s going on the concierge room service and housekeeping were all very helpful and nice when they came by
they off an annual membership that i feel is pretty reasonable too
after watching mystere  the show  we walked in this restaurant without knowing i would have the worse dinner of the month
i love the tacos and redchille
staying at the wynn allowed front line access to xs which was smooth cause we would go early leave drink up gamble eat and go back to party to 5am
the food did not disappoint once it arrived
it will cost more than the hotel room itself
both were amazing
beach club didnt look all that great the main pool is where its at
they also have an extensive choice of mojitos and selection of cocktails
airport shuttle  if you schedule an appt
only 26 people can go on each of these and the days are limited
took my 1st ccw class 050617 i literally started shooting hand guns a few weeks prior in preparation for this ccw class
all of the hot items i tried were basically tepid in temperature and looked as if they had been sitting a while
i love caesars because there is so much to look at in the casino
the bed itself was good with nice sheets and i slept well
go here it is alittle hidden away from the rest of the hotel casino which i liked
we had made our own dinner reservations and they were able to accommodate a limo pick up
i dont eat out that much anymore
just keep betting with your retirement
pros  weekend brunch is awesome
love this place
i have only been in the banquet room but it was a nice event and its decorated prettily for christmas
movie theater various restaurants of course slots and tablesnice gift shop as well
decent variety of food
circus circus offers good value and the best entertainment for kids in vegas
this was our first time visiting and initially i loved it
the lamp on the desk had a very bent shade the towelrobe hooks in the bathroom were all crooked my message light on my phone blinked all the time walls were thin and there was a very pissed off little dog a few doors down the tv remote wasnt much help the phone only called the front desk  the key card reader to the hotel from the nearest entry point in the casino didnt work so i had to go around and about to the lobby and back up to the tower to access my room and there was no in room book of services or restaurants
also the place felt dingy and smelled a little gross which seems to be a standard for anything in vegas that doubles as a casino
i mean several people were really pissed off in there over the seating
kitchen had a mini fridge and broken microwave
cafe tee kaltgetrnke kuchen man bekommt fast alles was das herz begehrt
we tried a few places in the casino but my personal favorite was diegos in the studio walk
the hotel also has a rooftop bar that is absolutely amazing
great place for young kids and for parents to socialize
until the day i was checking out
gianna came to our party as belle
our party bus was 2 minutes late so the kind woman at the front desk let 4 brides yes 4 weddings go on
most of my extended family is from pittsburgh and the last time we visited them they said we were going to eat at their favorite italian restaurant that theyve been going to for years
it was dumb and my feelings werent hurt because it was so obvious that the manager was just full of it
the price of each sandwich is around 67
a fair hotel a decent price
i mentioned that when i called in for a copy of the invoice i was told all i needed to do was check in
the bed was super comfy with plenty closet space for two
our two friends shared a video poker machine with 10 bucks and their drinks were comped
this is just my opinion
if you read the reviewyoull know what thats for
go for the sandwiches with avocado
i can definitely say i did gamble a little bit and winning about 20 may have led me to rate this place 5 stars instead of 4 but anyway it is incredible
that was also very nice
i wouldnt go out of my way to go here again but if im in the area i might swing by
would recommend her business to anyone
they play the same show every night and just hope someone requests whats on their play list
my hubby surprised me with a fun and creative post valentines day activity
so i went to eat at their roxy diner for the wait
thank you so much diya
giant wavy slides are a big hit
the nonsmoking rooms were for guests who purchased directly supposedly for a higher price
they called to check if we were happy and of course we werent
the most striking feature of this hotel is the atmosphere
they stated they would give me a high top facing the kitchen
awesome stay at the trump hotel
instead it was a long silence while we checkedin and we were on our way to the room
the  room was amazing
alright ill admit ive been driving past red devil for a decade now and always wondering what it was all about
3 hotels do not reserve your nonsmoking or smoking request either that or rivieria doesnt do that at all
try to find a hotel where they cant find a tv remote for your room
there is a window facing the side isolated road so you get sunlight in without any noise
the reason we went to her for the tickets is because i called the exhibit to get tickets and they told me the vdara concierge can take of it for us
and though its not open to the public at all times id be on the look out for future events here
but please do take your receipt in
the lighting is ambient and the room is beautifully laid out which makes you forget that youre essentially in a glorified office building in the middle of less than aesthetically pleasing downtown pittsburgh
my favorite meal is the sliders and try the fries but no matter what ive never had a bad meal in the multiple times ive been there
i dont know about anyone else but when it is mid december holiday season
i definitely recommend reaching out to these ladies to make your wedding dreams come true
upside  spacious suite excellent view comfy bed slept great restaurants are fantastic location is great and staff is friendly
my only gripe was that the jacuzzi didnt drain fast enough so we flooded the bathroom 3 times
the crowd was mixed but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd
it was like sardines in there im not even kidding
security cams got the lic
the new location is jawdropping
as we checked in we were told they did not have the type of room we reserved
your a burger joint
our waiter came over right away poured us a mimosa and water and explained what was on the buffet
however its simple clean and has an excellent staff
worst escape room in lv but still ok the staff is the best part of this place honestly
we were warned the service is sketchy at best
there are other cheap hotels and a lot that are just a few dollars more that are much nicer
he kept repeating that i was always booked at the hilton grand vacation suites
the hotel used to be great
my only complaint was the drink we order was a chocolate martini sporting an oreo cookie when served it was missing the oreo  come to find out they where out of oreo now tell me if i am wrong but how hard would it to be if they went to the store and got a couple of bags of oreo or take it off the drink special sheet
i dont think food is that bad
for 900 more we could have had more space but they were out of those rooms
it would only blow cold air
cant you move that
great selection of hot sandwiches at this walk up fast food sandwich shop at planet hollywood
i shot the smith and wesson 38 special revolver
my kids go and play for hours at a time
die meisten gerichte drften 050eur und 1 eur gesenkt angeboten werden aber is halt stuttgart wa   komme gerne wieder
we are also having our ceremony here outside behind the center
i fully intend to stay here if i ever feel inclined towards a miniature romantic getaway or something
i liked the casual atmosphere yet they had real white tablecloths candles and wine glasses on the table
and whats up with all the tv remotes everywhere i go being sticky greasy and dusty
oh and the beer was awesome too
in the evening we could sit on the patio and listen to live music till 10pm
tamales yes pork
michelle  aria reservations is the best  and their phone reservation system is a delightful nowait surprise direct to her or others help
if compared to the bellagio or any other places on the strip it would def rank 1 star
i really do not wish to leave a negative review however the food left a lot to be desired
the leaning tower is to die for  layers of french toast with cream cheese and blueberry jam
as a matter of fact it is because of the hospitality here that i now pretty much stay at marriott exclusively myself and i know that all springhill suites are pretty much the same
once for breakfast and once for dinner
gorgeous soft and fluffy
then my brother brought me here to culinary dropout where ribeye cap is rightfully an entree all to its own
potato croquette is def
i was also shocked at how dirty the hallways were
the hotel had a great facelift and the lobby is beautiful
waste of time and extremely unprofessional
im really upset that the nearest location to me is in orlando fl
we get to the doors and right when we step in we have this rush of horrible odor
pool was filthy and lots of missing tile cracks and leaves in water
thank you both again
bonus we never lost each other unless we wanted to
high enough up not to hear or experience the madness below
we were upgraded to a onebedroom suite with jacuzzi on the 36th floor upon our arrival
i had a combo with a cheese enchilada bean tostada and beef taco
add to this the fast and friendly service and you know i will be back
typical clean consistent hampton inn
this place is a gem
i look for extra linens and found blood on themseems like someone had their periodnext i smelled the pillow case and it smelled like an old rastafari dude just left his head odor for meso the next time i got home again like at 5am and i call room service for an extension on my checkout to 12 10 am checkout next the lady says i need to call at 9 am their leader for that to happen i told her the reason why im calling now is so i can get some freakin sleep who da hell go to sleep then wakes up in a couple of hours then sleep again weird so i ask the lady2x who is your leader
we would highly recommend this hotel for any out of towners needing to catch an early flight out of phx since it is soooo close
most of the wines were pretty sweet but they enjoyed them all
our service meant well but didnt seem to have the comfort or skill set to work at a place like this
not the worst or best place to eat late night
immerhin gibts hier nen kleinen shop zum einkaufen
avoid this hotel at all costs unless you are on a budget and are looking for a convenient place to stay
the food itself for me was just ok the desert was a disappointment and the price wasnt high for good food but it wasnt good it was just ok the room was very nice and makes for a nice experience
i loved that
the flower budget yields a beautiful year round display of color
then we tried to get a pizza
then you got the wanna be old guys in their 50s wearing ed hardy outfits walking around like theyre hot stuff
i couldve went bowling in mesa where i live
and largelarge women wearing no tops and thong bikinis
i am going to write a very honest review
please be forewarned
i absolutely give this 5 stars and a huge thank you to the management
and dont expect enthusiastic dealers
iphone case world would also be an appropriate name
stay away from the buffet
camp has a security gate with remote accessa good feature
the chart house use to be a real gem  sadly things have changed
the rooms area clean and modern
our room was great
but this sad story does have a happy ending as i tried this restaurant for the summerlicious event and it turned out to be an amazing dining experience for me
im about as unloyal a traveller as it gets
we were even given free desserts which no one else received that we noticed
the fettuccini that came with it was light if you can believe that alfredo sauce can be light
but just the way they manage their customers needs a great improvement
im looking forward to staying here in the future
overall a nice quiet place that doesnt have the smoke that many of the other hotels have
i had my dog with me and when i called to see if the hotel allowed dogs the woman on the phone said yes we love dogs
i couldnt believe it
we will definitely come back for another brunch
i went with a friend and we both ordered drinks
its nicer than other extended stays ive been to
we went here for an oktoberfest today after having purchased a coupon deal for admission and beverages 4 beers per person
the cont breakfast was adequate at best
but our unit didnt have a bathtub and the walkin shower reminded me of a freakin hospital shower
anyways when we got there at around 800ish it was pretty empty but boy did it get packed as the night grew longer
we had been here a few years ago and decided to try it again on this trip
heres where i get emotional
booked a suite which was fine and looking at other reviews better than their standard rooms
they may have a few issues to overcome but give them a couple of days
the food was excellent and the waitress fun and could answer all our questions
then after being out all day we come into our freshly maintenances room and are immediately hit with the overwhelming smell of marijuana
its been recently remodeled and has all the amenities needed for a relaxing spa experience
we spent more money than we would have liked taking cabs further north to get to the central strip
our guests had such a great time
oh and the complimentary gourmet granola bars were yummy
i played a lot of black jack both 15 and 5 and was always greeted with nice dealers i won 190 on a penny slot in this casino as well as 130 on the 5 black jack my mother in law won 300 on penny slots
all you can eat in some places doesnt mean anything because you dont want to eat any more but here it is great because the fish is so good
normally not a huge fan but after a full day of vegas overstimulation the muted tones are a welcome relief
they are pretty simple and its obvious they dont want you spending more time then needed in there
beer choices are kinda limited as they dont have some beers such as newcastle or guinness
we also enjoyed food at gordon ramsays burgr downstairs
free freshly baked cookies all month
i could not get any answer as to what constituted too much dirt
she was amazing and sexy and really made you feel comfortable doing all the movesand really funny too
besides flowers  its a type of product that impossible for return once unwrapped and given
yes but only for the quality of the room and not the service or the restaurant
we were about 4th in line and there were at least 3 people working the check in counter it took us 12 hour to even get up to the desk
this place is way off the strip
2 days after my stay my credit card bill showed an extra charge from vdara which was not in the receipt they gave me when i called back the hotel was basically saying there is nothing they can do for me
maybe 3 or 4 different buses went to that same station
i went to the front desk again
whybecause i was eighth in a growing line of people in a nonplatinum corral
but im happily ensconced in the la quinta airport north which has a welllit parking lot with surveillance cameras a location with lots of foot traffic the kind that looks like 50something mom and pops wearing dockers and mom sweaters across from gordon biersch ale house
the staff accommodated my requests
that really surprised me because i thought about homeless people and how they can buy a decent pillow at this place with just 099 and some change
i would give this place another chance and order something else
food was delicious  we ordered buffet style chicken milanese sirloin steak appetizers and beverages for about 150 people
long time no review
it is loud but they have a cool outdoor seating area w fire pits
im a big fan of the breakfast sandwiches here and will always make sure to get some when in vegas
another 10 minutes and one arrived
the chicken is deliciously seasoned and fried to perfection
i booked this hotel for our recent stay when i located a half off deal on pricelinecom
queen park social has a full wrap around bar dozens of tvs huge projector a bowling alley skeet ball shuffle board ping pong free throw basketball and places to lounge around all in between
the quantity of food provided has largely shrunk and some of the food just has a weird chemicaly taste
housekeeping on the next to last day forgot to leave glasses and the day before had forgotten to leave coffee
it cost about 500 more but its totally worth it
not only sandwiches they also have wraps salads cookies brownies and such
dinners had to take 30 minutes to come out
the grounds are covered in dog poo because its pet friendly maybe they should take that 50 deposit and pay someone to clean up after the irresponsible owners
i had a very nice view of the river and it is a very nice area of scottsdale
ive stayed at the harrahs before and it was an ok experience  i went back this time since it was comp it was the worst decision ever there was hairs in the bath tub  hot cheetos below the bed  and bottles cigarettes everywhere in a small balcony that was offered to us
it does not seem particularly well managed
personally id go for wynn palazzo or the cosmo if youre gonna pay the premium anyway
by the way all of the terms and conditions are clearly stated on their itinerary  that is sent that you are responsible for providing your own transportation back to the either casino or where ever you would like to go
blow dryer was broken and almost caught on fire when turned on
i didnt get a chance to stay here but got a chance to hang out  the pool for a few hours before attending an awesome wedding
i mean its not fancybut it works
now the cooktop
can count on them to be consistent with service and quality of food
handsdown without a doubt the best shower ive ever had
very satisfied with that
we opted for a drive thru fast lane wedding
well we could check in but they would charge us 40
honestly you cannot get the food much cheaper than what they charge and theirs is plated which makes your event nicer
didnt know that existed or i might have just order copious amounts of beer and poutine and enjoyed the game even more
this hotel was really nice like 15 years ago when i originally stayed here but no longer a 4 star hotel and would not recommend it to anyone
the hotel is decorated amazing and all the sparkles and chandeliers are lovely
nice pool and an okay exercise room
waitress had no enthusiasm or desire
think dressed up motel6
their opener of fresh bread and pesto is to die for  i had a lot of carbs but it was all in the name of good food and of course business
i must say i will look for springhill suites wherever i go next time for good clean hotel at bargain price
overall i had a great experience here
most locations would get a 5star review but this particular location fell a little short only because of the smell of the room
i remember that the drinks came on strong
would not recommend for families with children
i asked what they were giving him and they didnt want to tell me
no baking sheets or frypan in the kitchen either
its so bad i got another hotel for my remaining 3 nights knowing i forfeited my fees
and we also wanted to go kayaking but when we got to the place were we thought they rented them out at we were told that we had to go across the lake to do so
i call in and they say it wont be charged
there is no coffee in the rooms you must purchase a small cup for 9
the carousel is potentially neat in theory but the tanks are boring and cloudy which made the experience feel like forever
we booked and paid for our reservation in full through united vacations
wrote that off as woefully improbable but then found myself both hungry for meat and steps away from a qdoba yesterday
refrigerators coffee makers irons and hot water in the mornings
the palazzo has a variety of shops and restaurants to try as well
the only downfall is that the parking garage to the casino feels like you are walking in a marathondefinitely a good way to have people stop by at the shops
so then our friend asks for lemonade and the waitress gets another cup puts lemonade in it reaches over the food and pours it from one cup into our friends
my eggs benedict was delicious with a little zip and the bacon on it was nice and crispy
only thing that i wish they had was snack food vending
i always like the yogurt ones
the pool also seemed really nice only this was i went in february so we didnt get a chance to swim
it took 3 calls for them to come up and just spray some air fresher around the room
being at the wynn makes me feel like a million bucks
it came up after another 45 minutes of waiting
they dont even give you a bill
perhaps we were there at a slow time but we didnt feel rushed at all
we were driving through from phoenix to salt lake and needed a reasonably priced room and could also bring our black lab
irgendwie ist es was ganz besonderes obwohl sehr viele hotels am strip 5 haben und voll mit luxus gepumpt sind
i was traveling with my 4 kids ages 716 wife and near80 year old inlaws party of 8 and we stayed at the sheraton for 2 superb nights
i am here now
if you are looking for a nice fitness facility at the hotel id suggest to just give up on the idea
the menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as chicharrone pork rind and nopales cactus dishes along with an interesting   caldo de mariscos seafood soup
everyone in our table of 4 loved their meal with absolutely no room for dessertthis time
they even had sake and port
while i was changing the slot machine my reward card already inserted into the slot machine and in the middle of inserting the voucher a bartender passed by and i asked for a drink
i moved to las vegas last year since then i have had to grow my eyebrows out and start over more times than i would like to
michaels and joann have been much more flexible about stuff like this
the seating is bleacher style and made of metal
i was looking for 50 off deals or something
so if your looking for a place to party and sleep stay here but remember if you leave the hotel upon your return hold your hand up high at the door and your all good
and off we went
by doing it this way you get a real feel for the value of what you are getting for your money
this is my second stay here and its by far the only place i would want to stay in vegas
was a severe disaster
i looked at the pricing and was stunned
i wish they had night clubs again
he is such a great find  he almost seemed too good and too amazing for our neighborhood party
the only thing i would change is that the hot tub could be a little warmer after dark and have a sign clearly showing where the timer is
sorry doesnt keep the food from going bad which it did
the phone has the name of the person who booked the room
of course he feels bad in front of all the parents there to not tip them
it was nice and silky and the croutons
tasted as if it had been just made
in 4 hours you get to see a lot experience a helicopter ride walk inside the canyon if youre in vegas on business  dont even think about it just do it
can get pretty loud they always have music blaring
on customer service alone i would come back
i had a little trouble finding the place since there were little signs available
every employee from the time i called to make the reservation to the pilots to our tour guide mike were knowledgeable and professional
the room was ok but not special
further more no one takes their total rewards card anymore  no points to be given or taken  no discounts  not even their gift shop or own restaurant planet dailies  barf avoid at all costs  everyone in my group had tummy issues after eating there and some are still sick
chad and betty are absolutely wonderful
the location is good
2 dog amenities are very complete
i got a shrimp and bacon burrito very filling and scrumptious and my wife got a baja steak burrito
breakfast buffet was 999 during the week and had a good spread of food
this is my bfs favorite place mine is the girlier cosmopolitan tee hee
pita bread was very above average and was light and fluffy and fresh made
restaurant was clean and the food overall seemed like a more healthy choice than the other neighboring restaurants
oh dear if only i had known
bonus prime location on the outside of scottsdale fashion square
staying with a 5night comp
esther was great
good food and service and barwine menu
i was itching to play three card poker the whole time and so i tried it out on 10 dollar tables and yeah it destroyed me
and even though there was a resort fee of 1499 it didnt include free wifi
its awesome and so beautiful
when it came out it looked good
love love love
oh and the earl grey lemonade needs sugar
some of the other items seem a bit cheaper
boiled eggs and yogurt in the fridge commercially wrapped pastries that one can buy at the nearest 711 and really bad orange juice
brooke and kadie are amazing
if you want a sandwich the croque madame is always a good choice along with all the favorite entrees mentioned by other posters here
large kitchen counter with coffee maker and mini fridge
he doesnt realize petting and biting are not the same thing
the food is soso decent vegetarian fare with the exception of most of the tofu dishes which are spectacular
i have enjoyed every one of my visits here
compared to the other burrito joints in charlotte salsaritas falls somewhere in the middle
could be a myth but be sure to double check with the store in the event that you plan to walk to your destination with them
however with the amount of guests they deal with on a regular basis and the outstanding experience as a whole well still give it 5 stars
i was calling him hey excuse me
if you ever find yourself in boulder city  you gotta try this place
im not sure if this is their normal rate certain events hike up the prices like boxing event and such definitely worth checking out
overall great room at an unbeatable price free but ended up costing me more in gambling than i would have if i had stayed at a different casino
a great little neighborhood italian restaurant tucked away in a little shopping plaza
his works are displayed throughout
there is a super wide double vanity amazing soaking tub and rain shower stall next to it
let me explain for starters its billed as a 5 star resort
the location is at the very end of the strip
stop in if youre in the area or if youre tired of battling the traffic  parking at the willy st location plenty of parking  space here
kenny was easy to deal with worked with me to make my event special and thenit was all the details that really made the day
that said even if you buy all of those the price will still be lower than much of the competition
found fabulous printing and yep its fabulous
the room we selected was challenging but we escaped within 30 minutes
very good vibe from this professional as she exfoliated my pores for a good while
cons are all food related  no minibar snacks drinks in the room  no room service
yes old building charm history cool but in the heart of downtown phoenix in this modern age you can update your buildings to keep the old charm and still allow for the enjoyment of modern conveniences
but i didnt need them
when i told them i meant for them to be the next day they were so gracious about it
plus it includes a breakfast
if you want more of a guarantee in terms of polished service head east
noticing that the immediate neighborhood around this hotel was notsonice even though its on the strip technically my boyfriend and i decided to just spend the entire time here
back middle is where you wanna be
the girls who he didnt have the hots for were thrown off after a few seconds
on top of all that 10 minutes later the hooker was still there and another casino pit boss showed up and i only had to mention that i really didnt want this woman near me and he walked over to her and told her to leave
rather annoying when shampooing
when we arrived we where offered an upgrade of 50 add a night i sd ok why not its my bday
for snacks we ordered the mardi gras fries to share
theres not much more to add to the plethora of yelp reviews
the customer service wasnt bad it just wasnt great
menu is busy hard to read and they need to focus on what they do well which is undetermined at this point
ive just been asked if i want vegetables or chips with my vegetable stir fry
id rather stay here than excaliburnynysouth pointe monte carlotreasure island
i also cant believe they charge 30
if the company is paying this is where you go for sushi in montreal
cricket works fine on base
it wasnt really good for this purpose
the steak house is always excellent and i love the soup at the seafood shack
i havent left the hotel since i arrived so i have no idea whats near here but i think not much if you dont have a car
clean and fun
we were arriving late so already or stay was going to be short for the evening
nice suite in venezia tower
ive never stayed at the actual hotel but id recommend it just based off the waterslide
the chocolate cake with oreo filling was very rich and delicious
if you want to sleep away from the craziness of the strip but still want a nice room to spend your time in you have found your place
most of the footage was on vhs some on 8mm
theres no casino on the property and there arent a bunch of drunks or barely clothed people running down the halls at 4am yellingsmokingpassing outtrying to get into the wrong room
my go to place if i have people from out of town
after regaining my emotional footing i ordered the aforementioned dessertpassingforbreakfast
it would be nice to have at least one day a week or a portion of the day where there isnt relentless party music
the 2 bedroom suite was perfect
something they dont voluntarily offer are these white head sleeves that provides a barrier from all the sweaty helmets
each room had a toilet two sinks a shower a bath tub and a tv
3 poor tv quality no dvd player no ipod or usb hookup
our server matthew was super attentive and friendly making the evening more enjoyable
thankfully we didnt live like pigs so we got by but for the time i was there our room was only scheduled to be cleaned once
my only complaint is that it was difficult to get seats at the pool area
came here to see the dan band
this is by far the best looking casino resort in vegas
die bedienungen im palm beach wechseln ungefhr so hufig wie ich meine socken und meine socken riechen nicht
the photographer took pictures and your package you pay for only includes ceremony pictures not the ones posed for after ceremony which are an additional charge6 for a 46  oh and they will charge couple 100 if anyone takes pictures in chapel
my friend ordered the smoked salmon
best shrimp in grits youll find in cleveland
it is not easy to get to the casino and hotel from the parking lot
a prescription pill
i like it
ive wanted one in my apartment ever since
did you know there is a flight path right over the strip
when i called down to ask for a room change there was never an answer from the front desk i was on hold for 20 mins
didnt we pay enough to stay there
i havent tried the anaheim location yet but this vegas one is still a trusty goto
and the pool looked totally dirty
you are basically told over and over before during and after the show what a phenomenal magician criss angel is
vdara is a nice hotel but their parking situation needs work
there was more than enough storage space in the closet area and tons of hanging space
big tube tvs and push button phones
if you want a cheap good for the price hangover breakfast for 350 and 1 bloody marys this is the place
disclaimer there are no bottomless mimosas here
of all the hotels the bed was very comfortable with soft and firm pillows
we ordered chicken parmigiana which was a huge order of two chicken breasts served atop linguine
in order to keep the medieval theme they do not serve utensils only with the ravioli so be prepared for literally a handson meal
the music was all over the place
this place is certainly worth seeing while youre in vegas
while it was too cold out to enjoy it it was nice to be able to let some fresh air in
this hotel was a fantastic stay for me and my friends
for the price of the room and what you get you cant really complain
no questions on that one
he really makes it look easy and he makes you look great
she was super nice
our room was expensive but worth it over all
ran across this place on a work trip to mesa and it was truly a hidden gem
pasta bolognese  very good
we didnt have time to try those out
but i broke down this summer when i was passing through vegas needed a place to crash for a few hours and had a bunch of myvegas points burning a hole in my pocket
bathroom is a decent sizethe full length mirror in the bathroom is really nice but they dont have any other mirrors in the room other than the two in the bathroomwhich was weird oh and i think the only restaurant in the mgm opened 24 hrs
daily planet restaurant we felt harassed by guest services each time we walked to and from our room to and from the entrances and to and from the casino floor promoting shows tours and packages
i think its absolutely insane to charge 7 for water from a spigot in the back thats put into a bottle and refrigerated before serving
overall this place could use a remodel
most enjoyable was the excellent friendly staff
i give this hotel four stars only because the adventuredome indoor theme park the hotels main draw was closed
our guests left full and happy
enough to feed about 70 people
i love their uniform too
i belong to the mlife reward program and one of the most important benefits to me has been the buffet line pass which circumvents hours long waits
a 250 incidental hold was put on my credit card in addition to the room rates so i asked to pay the bill in full in order to free the hold
the aquarium occupies a huge space right beside the butterfly pavillion
they said it was booked up at govt
the rooms themselves are what youd expect from a 3star hotel perfectly adequate and functional but otherwise nothing special and definitely nofrills
coyote mexican restaurant downstairs was gross but the churros dessert was fantastic
dirty is best to describe it
i must point out very reasonably priced for the quality they provide
i mean the guy even escorted me to the bathroom
order a drink take a load off and enjoy yourself
definitely recommend this place so far
repeat customer most def
everyone raves about how good it is and it didnt hit the mark
once again this store is so amazing
the food was good
let me tell you something
very reasonably priced considering the amount and quality of the food
on saturday my husband realized that he had left behind a laundry bag full of clothes in our plaza hotel room
our room was spotless comfortable and well appointed
paper tiger is one of those shops where you always seem to find what youre looking for and lots more that you didnt even know that you needed
they have an old horse racing machine that is fun to play for hours without spending a lot of money
very pleasantly impressed
i did not choose this hotel  a girl from our group did and i wish i can strangle her for it a joke
overall experience was great
i would definitely see this again
he went downstairs to actually talk to the front desk people and finally managed to wrangle us another room for the night so about 230am we had to pack up everything and move a couple floors down
they have 5 tables which is nice
since we both have demanding jobs we decided to use a travel agent to help coordinate everyones trip
we go to mon ami gabi everytime we are in vegas and wanted to try something different
dont know how well this european bathing trend is catching on
the broccoli guac was the only thing that didnt do much for me it was too smooth to be compared to guacamole
the bathroom was also infuriatingly unlit with the actual switches nowhere near the toilet at all
check around to find it
there are 3 tvs in the room a small flat screen in the bathroom and two in the suite the first facing the sleeping area and the second in the lower lounge area
note i will say i decidedly did not enjoy the caesar salad  it just seemed pretty lifeless and not for lack of dressing
yeah she said and tossed the menu on the table my way
i had a room booked for months at a marriott location next door but decided to use our points from wyndham mostly from the wyndham grand pittsburgh stays
we had salasritas catered for a meeting recently for lunch and it was extremely salty
it gets a bit loud on live music nights but thats really to be expected
pasta craving ration salad bar  and more
reserved vinh as our wedding dj two weeks before the wedding recommendation by our wedding coordinator at bali golf club
started with oysters and shrimp cocktail
i only order sushi and ive been nothing but impressed their sushi is amazing
emily  who helped me get a good price and an awesome bus was so good with working with me even helping me
the ice house is a beautiful venue but if you are considering this for an event the management company just ruins it
its also hard to find as mentioned as they have a strange spacesharing arrangement with maki sushi which is what is actually on the sign
ps i highly recommend the circus animal ice cream since it has crushed up animal cookies in it
the area seems to be ok  in walking distance of the wynn
p this sandwich shop definitely makes the top 5 list of sandwich shops ive ever been too youll be seeing me again earl of sandwich i promise
you would think that hotels would give their ookay rooms as free rooms and if this is the wynns version of an okay room i wonder what their upgraded rooms look like
never coming here again
i was so in love with the look of this place
service was super nice just so slow we guessed it was the kitchen not the waitresses
we were quickly seated even without a reservation but unfortunately this is the end of the highlight
after easter they had a lot of leftovers at 9 for 99 cents
par contre le service est plus que trs ordinaire
when we got off the plane the shuttle drivers didnt know who they were
i also had the the el pastor mini taco which was not yummy at all
the breakfast at the marketplace is very good
they ended up taking off the bonus charge on the freezing night but i had to use my persuasion skills to get that done
while the room was very spacious the dated control 4 system wasnt really working and it took almost 45 minutes to get an engineer to come up and allow for use of the television
were on vacation and the walls are knocking and people are stomping above us  come on now
great lakes brewing company is well know to those who live in the midwest but its a shame that its not all over the us they have a great selection of all different types of beers
easyjust walk by the towel guy and say you are a guest of xxx on this day i actually was a guest of someone but i wonder no hassle no problem nice day
ok im going to try to be fair to the earl
the casino staff were very friendly as well
we were consuming more that anyone else at their outside bar yet i had to get up to get my own drinks
a little pricey but worth the atmosphere and buzz
that has been and will continue to be the major downfall for the luxor
thank you so much justin you make me a great trip
i went on a monday during lunch this place is 70 men and 30 female
gluten free offerings get my 5 star vote
they also offer both family friendly sessions and 21 byob sessions
i then began my vacay restfully avoiding the above four things
that a steal considering taxi fare and sitting in traffic
the service first and foremost was outstanding  very speedy and friendly of course the chicken was honestly to hot to eat so i had to wait to eat it but i dont mind at all cause cold food that is served is my absolute pet peeve i hate it  but this wasnt an issue but overall it was very clean and a pleasant visit
pros full kitchen pools shuttles cons small parking spots over priced connivence store
tv quality and selection poor too
my husband had the rib eye steak dinner he really enjoyed his dish
i wouldnt necessarily stay at the flamingo again but i dont regret staying there for our first time in vegas
the staff were generally courteous and nice though some where a bit aloof and cold we did meet three really nice valetcab guys during our stay
we added a pianist which made the quick ceremony extra special
has pretty much everything you need just like most other hotelresorts
considering earl of sandwich is 24 hours this is a pretty legit sandwich place
be sure to check out the gift shop and the beautiful life of christ display on the premises
preislich in ordnung service top und auch das ambiente ist recht nett
rooms are on par with the best on the strip which is expected for this high end stay
it is a fun place to spend a saturday just dont expect anything too elaborate
i attended a wedding here in sept staff was rude and unprepared
it is located in the town  country shopping center next to nordstrom rack
i did not find it to be over crowded
i got a greek salad one time all the ingredients were just so fresh for a fast food places and very decent quality
the staff is not friendly the guy at the snack counter got upset with me because i ordered something right before he was going to clock out sooorrry
thought about going to the house of blues and take in a billy idol concert but after researching tickets  380 for two people we abandoned that as quickly as the gambling
the teapot was the most darling perfect venue for a small event approx
more money to spend on goodies
i had them last year and we decided to stay at the encore again for the nachos
the only problem was that the walls were incredibly thin and we could hear everything that was being screamed down the hallways by drunks at 3 am   2 my friends wedding reception that was held here was lovely
uptown alley is a destination in surprise after a padres vs ranger game
although willy street coop is on the pricier side of grocery stores it does boast a large variety of local organic and sustainable products
i noticed they also had a big selection of pre made pizzas that looks delicious
oh and the food was great
they definitely would have made more money off us that night had the music been at a reasonable volume
but one look at the menu and i was already seeing a red flag
front desk staff were very helpful
got sat quickly
the pool is awesome and iirc the towels are provided as a courtesy
she wasnt very entertaining and didnt provide a lot of quality instructions
similar to m hotel if you like to have a drink or two while your gambling this is sort of a destination resortcasino rather than one you can go into and then wonder into a neighboring casino
very clean and nicely furnished hotel
called from out of town found them on googlevery pleased with the service they offered
there are so many nice places to stay in las vegas that i will make sure never to come back to this hotel again
i would have given it 5 stars but the help and assistance that the concierge gave us was horrible
i was so excited to check this place out as east 185th street has been lacking a nice place to have a cup of coffee
we sat outside in their patio area
we just walked in quick to get our brows done while waiting for my car to be worked on down the street
he stated 90 of the time the rooms test negative for a situation like this
great mix of dishes and drinks
it was tough to deal with no ac they dont leave the remotes in the room and cut the circuit breaker so it doesnt work unless requested
one way to avoid the long drive thru and walkin lines is to download chickfilas one app
kona coffee yep im putting the coffee on here cause it was good
ok where do i begin  this past weekend was mexican independence weekend and the big fights in vegas my hubby  i went up with 6 other friends to watch the canelo vs lopez fight so i turned to yelp to find some hot spots to hit up after the fight i always search by highest rating first and at the top of the list was free vegas club passes i thought to myself hmmmm yeah right nothing is free
definitely will be back again
a little slow but didnt mind and gave me time to look at all the amazing cookbooks and specialty items
poached egg lardons and vinagarette my husband had the steak and frites and i had the bouchon steak
check it out if your looking to print quick
was professional friendly and had excellent skills
on each of my visits i was greeted when i entered the store
i hope this review was helpful and i hope that those who are having second thoughts staying at the riviera will have a little relief lol
too bad we live right there and were excited to have a high end dining option within walking distance
yeah yeah i know theyre famous for fish tacos
this one is fairly cheap and has a great feel to it
service nice host and server
then said here are your keys elevators are behind you
some reasons why i loved this hotel  1 fun modern decor  2 comfy bed  3 awesome views
maybe everyone was busy taking care of mr vomitwho knows
when i walked into my room i saw an open beer bottle
thank you all
large jacuzzi tubs that fit two very comfortably
in vegas for a few days and am spending my last night at trump
friendly easy parking
i took advantage of this item when i checked out and the bruggers bagel bakery was right there and open early to get breakfast at before heading to the train station
i cant wait till the next time
the easy access to fremont street and all the casinos in very close proximity make this a wonderful choice
we stayed in a beautiful suite  the view wasnt the best but the room was spacious the bathroom was gorgeous
what a fantastic experience
he was excellent with communication and followed up on his own just to see how things were coming along in the monthsweeks leading up to our wedding
plus before i forget wtf
the serving sizes are pretty large too
see also joes seafood steak and stone crab review
if you decide to stay at the palazzo i hope you have a good time
only downer was the slow room service due to the hotel being so full
jacuzzi isnt fixed
they did not tell me that chicken is considered to be 2 toppings
from staying at hundreds of other choice hotel brands over the years im not used to that
attempt 1 at check in my familys check in time was 3pm
im sure ill bring her back again
you can technically sit down at the tables here and order food from the neighboring triple george grill but at heart this place is really just a dive bar with fantastic bar food
i might have expected him to confirm that asking a guest for credit card info to return a leftbehind item is or is not their policy and maybe share what the hotels policy actually is for lost  found items but he didnt
congrats palazzo over 50 of nickel and diming you lost a great customer for life
it was decent
we check in and the guy behind the counter was completely rude and then told me i had to put down a 50 dollar deposit i was pretty upset because nowhere i have stayed has ever done that so much for the no resort fees thats how they get you because you dont recieve it back until you check out
see the show and find out for yourself
finally after no customer service i asked them i if i could at get my food to go and it took over 40 min to get our food
they do not allow outside food or beverages making it extremely inconvenient to get a morning cup of coffee or a late night snack
i was told i could choose which ever beer i wanted that came with it
the 2 bedroom suite had a great view while the one i stayed in did not lol
one was to take a smaller room at a discounted rate and the second being to move over to aria sky suites and have a one bedroom penthouse at a discount
the menus are scrawled in sharpie and theres other personal reminders by the counter
id give this five stars if they dropped the nocameras policy
their booking system is inaccurate and broken so i dont recommend booking through them online
we both had rusticas  i believe she had something with eggplant yuck and i had the god daughter which was delicious
or the resort could just post that one pool is adults only
it has always been a good deal
the food was delicious
those could use a wash or two
at this point i have no desire to visit chompies in the future
good deal for the money plusses good midtown location very reasonable rate for the price an overall pretty nice looking hotel
otherwise great stay nice room great service  nice view
solid place with a cool vibe and decor
the worst place i wished i had checked yelp before i booked my room
the food is great and the prices are reasonable
the bathroom is so big and the jacuzzi tub is inside the giant shower
portfolio  chicken tikka masala chana masala palak paneer
one of the best salads i have had out
rent a car and hit the strip a couple of nights but dont rent from fox they suck
ill spin the wheel pun intended
i peeked outside to catch a view since we paid for a strip view upgrade and the view was very disappointing
separately managed company from the mirage so it was kinda  a bummer to not be able to bill to the room it was still a nice treat to add to the experience
now in case the person next to you isnt already in your armpit the hacking specimen across the table is no longer behind a divider
ill come again to have a drink and see a show but definitely wouldnt eat here
i really liked this hotel and would stay here again
well actually i had to grab a fat tuesday of course but this was my second stop
anyways enough about that
what was supposed to be a very relaxing couple of days time off upon checkin our suite was not ready
i definitely recommend coming here and trying it for yourself
remember to tip the shuttle driver at drop off because its the right thing to do
my advice remember where you park
ironically they have an awesome pool
with a name like rhumbar youd expect overpriced uninspired rum drinks served by aloof cocktail waitresses
theres nothing wrong with the bridal shop
it was more like ice tea
clean swanky amazing staff
do wish they had more odd sized frames because couldnt find a 1013 tabletop frame
i dont think they have a no smoking policy
i had the filet and marty had the meatloaf
the receptionist i think her name was brenda let me lock up my purse in her office and get into whenever i needed
they said needed to be gotten at booking
we rotted by the pool for two days and the girls on the deck took great care of us
filled with drunk people  again a lot of kids around them too
thank you so much
lights are on or off as a group
know ahead of time that theres a hidden ish fee of 20 for a resort fee but its still a great deal
there is a bar right in the middle of the casino where you can be stone throw away from the next millionaire
the toilets did not work properly
the restaurant was full
if thats too much than i guess we have to agree to disagree  this is just my point of view
i had the best jambalaya in the whole wide world and tempted the guy sitting next to me at the bar to give up on his cheeseburger lunch plans and opt for the jambalaya
also they dont have wifi just a single ethernet cord hidden away in the armoire
the sandwiches are so gooood
all of that ambiance comes at a price which are 10 small sandwiches
the pool is small and not as nice as some other hotels ive stayed at but that didnt bother me because as long as my toddler had a good time in there  thats all that matters to me
the owner is amazingly friendly honest and generous
the hotel itself used to be the las vegas hilton
not even qtips
a child could easily injure themselves on a ladder in one of these dark places and there would be nobody around to help them let alone even be aware
he was never pushy or insistent and emailed me my receipt right away
if you want good food go to aria
its pretty impressive the heat this thing puts off 100 feet away and it feels like you stuck your head in an oven
they had one small pool partially open that was so filthy that people made footprints on the bottom when they walked not to mention the multiple floaties everywhere in the water
potenzas drivers seem to be the nicest ones weve had to deal with
the worst reservation i have ever had
however once again i will not be back to the trop because of the ridiculous resort fee
had red rice a few days ago and the fiesta plate fed three people
i stayed there for one week
overall the hotel is nice complimentary breakfast and happy hour is a bonus for those who stay
we received a couple of tickets along with our package from us airways
they also had a noticeable whinehum throughout the day
why bother replacing carpets
the employees bummed into us all night long one security guard at the entrance to the stage was an ahole he thought he was so important
the rooms are very large and most are one bedroom suites
the seats are also very densely packed together
ive been here a few times in the past for some family events but would have never chosen it for my own outing
everything is ala carte so remember if you want fries to order them
a good place to drink late in night
its not bad its clean but just been there forever kind of old
first they were an hour late delivering the food
she didnt even clean the room and simply changed out the towels and made the bed
the wine bar and cafe downstairs are fantastic too
tim remembered this told the manager and gave us our dessert for free without even mentioning it to us
how does a sandwich place not have pickles
they do have two types of body soaps though one bar soap and one pyramidshaped bar soap super cute
it got charged to my credit card
they both wanted breakfast and i was wanting lunch so it was the perfect place to go
he was supposed to have it for two nights
however the room itself was filthy
ordered smoked salmon bagel with onions and capers and a cup of chai tea
they both made my late night arrival much more pleasant
it lied they only have valet parking which for me is cumbersome as i do not like to hand my keys to a stranger one
the room is decent
i dont write a lot of reviews on herebut when i get great servicei want others to know about it
after seeing all of these 5 star reviews i feel bad giving it 3 stars but this place made me feel so uncomfortable
the elevators were tiny and kind of slow
so we ended up staying at the same hotel both nights and it was just a few blocks from the heinz field
the lobby supported the first impression and even the bar and the pool area indicated that the rooms just might be equipped with jetted tubs and a wet bar
this was very important to me because i have small children and small dogs
add to all that a very good sitdown dinner and youve got a night to remember
after a day of sight seeing on the strip we returned to our rv to find that a good portion of the rv parking lot had lost power including the section that we were in
the sandwiches are amazing
the room had a door to an adjoining room which was locked
the bacon was the limpest and greasiest ive ever had
this is a pretty average sushi place
it tasted a little watered downed and lacked flavor
front desk was friendly
my warm vegetable chopped salad was brought out without any dressing but i had to wait until the waitress finally surfaced only because our neighboring table had to ask the hostess to find her so they could get their bill
when i play the baccarat that has monitor with human card dealer it looks like the video game but its not really i bet the player and the player won but the computer registered the banker won so it makes me lost my bet
honestly being completely implacable and marring the last taste of someones vacation over 25  bad show and classless caesars
bell hops were prompt and very friendly
the taxi on the way back to the airport was 12
and if you did they were always done before you were back to the room even if you only went out for an hour
finding a table big enough for a large group of people is a bit hard cause it can get pretty crowded
bar service at the pool was good too and i always had a drink in my hand
be sure to request stacy as your server
thank god it wasnt busy because the service was so slow
i am not positive of the rental price but i was there for one holiday office party and one charity event so im going to guess for how gorgeous it is its not too pricy
great burgers and the tastiest tender chicken sandwich ive had in ages
i just felt all yucky walking around
love this place
luckily there are still remnants of discos past inside
the room had a nice 55 hdtv two huge mirrors on each side of the room that were framed in accent lighting that was kinda cool
vendingfail i hopped on the locals special and signed up ahead of time to get free tickets
they have entertainment galore some of the best lowcost highvalue shows such as legends caveman and improv
the casino itself is virtually smoke freedefinitely better than any on the vegas strip
the second was just as bad
this place however is chic and low key
the property is lovely and im very fond of the outdoor seating areas with the spouting turtles and waterfalls that overlook the lake and sandy beach
and everything was great
would come back if in the neighbourhood or just a good place to get ideas for gifts that i later end up buying online usually for cheaper
i ordered a fresco vegetarian burrito and will continue to order for the foreseeable future
3 add a few more benches
admission fee for all day play for the three of us was only 18 since they provide 20 military discounts
if youre in the mood for a tasty nottooexpensive sandwich this is your place
they also nickel and dime you with dennys caliber food at 5 star prices
the staff and venue are amazing
i suggest street or private parking lots which can range from 1020
red embers has some great burgers
since its off the strip the casinos rather dead in the evening as it doesnt get the casino hopper action the resorts on las vegas blvd
the casino itself is sorry and smokey so im definitely not going to indulge there
he cleared the clog after 3 hours of us not being able to use the restroom
der service war freundlich und schnell
we attending a family fun night for our daughters school fundraiser and we had a good time
amazing cheap authentic tacos
i was perfectly aok with this place
on monday through thursday nights homewood suites offers an evening reception which we expected to be cheese and crackers and that would be about it
there is also a less crowded grand luxe at the adjoining palazzo
i have to wash it by myself
and i let it run for 10 solid minutes on both mornings
shes also great at doing the little extra touch up work for that extra special touch
he does free shows every day at 3 430 and 7 in bills tiny tiny lounge
there arent any restaurants
they also serve light snacks at the bar at night but i wish they served some more substantial selections
ive been to bouchon twice now
i nibbled on my husbands greens and rib tips
they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on
but it was not it took place while other guests were to my left and to my right
curry dish there is awesome
we also went home with their hotel feather downed pillows
it had a closet but when im on vacation i do not want to hang up my clothes
i really really wanted to give the flamingo at least a 4star rating
we would definitely go back to try the other rooms
the only reason i left a star off was that the hallways could use a paint job  one morning we picked up some fruit there that was frozenspoiled
after a long drive in the storm of the century dropped car with valet they were polite and efficient
they think they are better than they really are
would be a good place for kids
the servers are very nice but a victim of poor management cost cutting and just rubbish food
be prepared when coming to stay that it is very pricey
i really wanted to like this place despite the bad yelp reviews because the atmosphere and views are so pretty and ive been to the chart house in california and it was really good
it has been the only time in a vegas hotel where the noise outside of the hotel was so loud it prevented me from sleeping
god bless hobby lobby their attention to their customers their values that cause them to close on sundays and their wonderful merchandise
if i wanted loud music 247 i would have booked the cosmo next door
instead it was like being part of a herd
the patio seating were not tables it was either patio furniture or high top tables
i sort of agreedmy beef grin sorry was that the fish portions were on the smallish side
if you want to win play here loosest slots where locals play
all things considered short notice tuesday night i still had a blast
open 24 hours and yes its good
i didnt mind the wait just because i could admire the view
we have visited multiple mlife locations both for hotel stays and for gambling but never have i ever had such a horrible experience at one hotel
i was hoping this wasnt setting the tone for the night
looks like somebody is trying to up the profit  however this will assuredly drive away customers
we stayed in an upgraded king suite and the room and linens were of premium quality and the flat screen hd tv was nice
other times werent bad at all
if i ever eat at fired pie again it will only be the one by amc 30 always had a great experience there
i would come back here
the pool was closed we didnt want to use the spa i mean they could easily deny access through our room keys if we opted out of using them
if the corned beef wasnt so fatty it would be good
more dean  deluca than intermarch or bioterre which is across the street
longer wait but really great breakfast burritos
artsy at its best
born and raised bar had a nice beer selection and the service was excellent
the north end of the strip
i will give it a few more tries
touted as the best breakfast in town hash house a go go served the coldest breakfast in town as well
55 not worth the manicure at all
we tend to be less is more types for meals
not a sidesalad not a larger salad
chipotle mayo was awesome and we had to get a mexican coke too
i read a lot of positive reviews for their cakes so we decided to get a haupia cake
this is a nice clean hotel up to marriott standards
management claimed they didnt know about this but it was obvious they knew about it
it is 110 outside
boston market yum
beds are comfy showers have warm water and drain properly
she called for a rollaway bed for us and we waited another half hour before the scary wornout bed arrived
we stayed here for one night passing through because we were doing their tournament of kings show
it was a bit cold and there were no extra blankets in the room
tell all your friends relatives and coworkers and make sure they stay around as long as theyre willing
lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property
we would definitely stay here again the next time we visit
theres not a lot of casino action in the way of poker games but slots galore
and say hey so they said their nachos are stale
i usually get the chicken pita plate and it is excellent
a nice break from all the sandwich  burger options that were there
i didnt know what to expect but you should expect something slightly better than a motel room
i love my henna by gita
after reading reviews i didnt want either of these rooms because i had heard complaints
the bruschetta is my favorite because of the prosciutto atop a crescenza cheese
the salad was pretty good and came in a cool cylindrical formation
i had issues with an immediate entrance door not reading my room card but it could open the door to the next level although miniscule it was a huge inconvenience
the fish was not good it was rather greasy
it would be a fantastic platter to serve any day but this is special for bastille day
the staff is very friendly and helpful too
made my day
the one great thing the hotel has going excellent customer service
i waited on the long line
was making a order for pick up asked her questions and she was very vague and impolite
we were very happy plus we were 20 steps from the pool as well
im not sure why im getting a response from sienna 2 years after i wrote my review
so once again i thought okay cool
this is the place to go
just off the strip
customer service is everything to me
she was quick and efficient
the selection is better than other services i looked into
only after restating the original complaint did someone from sales contact me was offered a future room upgrade should i choose to return and waste more money there
lorna was amazing and helped ease my mind
my favorite is the creme brle french toast w blueberries agave syrup bottomless mimosas for sunday brunch then some retail therapy at widow den boutique
its like being in la
we arrived in the early morning hours and were tired from the drive
i also took art to vegas for his birthday this year again
after our meal we were offered coffee for free
she guided me in a way that is beyond incredible
we stayed in the carson tower suites as we chose the lowest budget rooms
ribs were fantastic but again wtf on the fries and his coleslaw was like practically from a grocery store deli
i told her what she did and just gave me a napkin from another dish that was on my table
these men and women were working hard seriously
you could trip over the cord in your room if you are not careful
great selection and really nice staff
he had to go out of his way to deliver what she wanted and it was so good we all started drinking them
it was a wonderful visit and a perfect location to enjoy montreal
and it all stems back to the unbelievable service provided by employees and management
i was still getting lost on my 5th day there
we never thought we would bring our kids to vegas but it has turned out to be one of our funnest vacations we have ever had
environment is amazing
first of all when we checked in to our room the door didnt lock the lock was apparently broken
the bathtub had jets in them and there was a tv on the opposite side of the tub
i would come back again just to try their sandwiches and to see what the buttery cake dessert is all about
my room was spacious well ventilated and the internet was fast and easy to access
the only thing i liked about the room was that we had mirrors all over the place and even above the bed  well at least we didnt have a lagoon in the shower like i did at the mgm grand
marriott city center was the crash site for my best friends bachelorette party
if youre a coffee lover like i am you will enjoy some of the best coffee ive ever tasted
the chips were unsalted and the salsa literally burned my mouth
low key options are also available like madam tussauds and gondola rides
but they werent always where they needed to be
i tried to contact management on several occasions
we had a great time there for my sister in laws birthday
that said it was pretty bad
at the table it took about 1 hour for drink service to come
she barely did a top coat and my nails are already chipping after 4 days
the uplighting colors as well as the pin spots were amazing
i knew nothing about vegas so i had no idea where this hotel was situated
the worst part is she has extreme social anxiety and it was a surprise for her to be with her friends and family
in vegas a 20 night deviance can really open up your options
so we were going to a formal dinner on the strip and were waiting to be picked up along the roadway
as you walk into the lobby you will notice right away at the high tech nature of this casino
its better furnished there arent terrible dust bunnies on the base of the table lamps and you wont wake up feeling like you rolled around in someone elses
will definitely be going back again
the hotel has a multitude of rooms and ballrooms for the purposes of group events
they have numerous cardio machines each with their own television with cc complimentary disposable headphones free weights weight machines and a dry sauna
the staff
their processes or info systems however are disastrous
when i checked in i made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to vegas makes
the elevators were clean and fast and quiet
i plan on going back someday to hopcat for an in restaurant experience but for now i will laud the joy and tastiness that these fries are
i had an absolutely amazing time and i will definitely come back again
the reason for the harsh review is that both my boyfriend and i are in the service industry and couldnt believe how bad the service we received from her was
we flew in on a friday night for a 5 night stay for our anniversary
once you run around you get warmed up but for the fun it was worth it
the refrigerator is in a closed cabinet so it never gets cold because the hot air from the coils cant escape
they also seem to have random staff roaming the property probably for maintenance purposes but theyll also pick you up and take you to your room if you get lost
it appears theres a bar and restaurant up one or two floors from the lobby but i didnt check it out
had a great stay and hope to be back soon
i think its a tad over priced which is the main reason im giving 4 stars vs 5  but it was very yummy and id definitely be back
i only recommend staying here if you want to wake up to mosquitos in your ear and cockroaches crawling on your arm and on the floor
they spray all their rooms
our parking pass was on the car dash so they could have easily given us a courtesy call to the room to say hey move your car
the grounds are pretty dark and creepy
the decorations were very nice and i was so happy that i didnt need to worry about decor or setup like you might have to at a nonwedding focused venue
moving on to a better hotel
we used on the go casino on a last minute final decision
but paying to stay when i am already paying to stay smfh
there werent many comfortable places to sit but i was with good friends and thats all that matters
this is a old hotel but it seems to have been restored
otherwise i would have given it a 1 or 2 the first was ms t murray she was absolutely fabulous
looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food
the staff acted snotty and not there to please the customer in any way at all
generous portions great sides awesome sauces and reasonable prices
the foie gras aged in a glass jar was a great preview of whats to come
great bar staff
we will request him going forward
it is roughly 1300 acres of beautiful desert with a couple golf courses sprinkled in the mix
she has also done a canvas for me that i could not be happier with portrayed artistically what i was looking for and henna gives it an interesting feel and look that people cant help but look at it up close
welcome to the hood l  l so happy youre here
do yourself a big favour and order it
this cost a few thousand to step back in time and we did
i have been here a few times and never disappointed
i was here for a conventionconference a while back and seeing i was cheap i booked a room in the courtyard
i ordered the waffle with a side of sausage
the restaurant is easy to find if youre arriving at the venetian by cab the elevator is right off the main checkin desk but if youre walking in from the strip through the casino youll probably get lost
they have some sunglasses that seriously lasted a trip through the salt river on a day trip
awesome house lo mein love it
it is also nice that even though they are a brewery they do not forget about people with children
excellent wine live music friendly staff very attentive
she was very attentive energetic and was down for a good time
i was in phoenix for an event and a free afternoon before it started so went exploring
not to worry
all four burgers arrived approximately 20 minutes later without the pizza
my group had vip seats that we thought were well worth it
the main server attempted to do a better job but i could easily overhear hear and other waiters and staff complaining about the customers near the salad area
the room was a smoking room and smelled awful
i would say that this is an ok place to book your hotel
the parking lot was so freaking far from the lobby  we lined up for 20 minutes to get checked in
local bakery that has been a icon of the community since 1949 if you live in the area you have heard of baraonas and chances are the first words out of someone mouth when you mention their name is have you tried their cassata cake
big mistake palms
all the employees are super fun and give your experience and comfortable familiar feel
i made a first plate a protein plate  meatballs and sausage picked from the sausageandpeppers from the italian section the heel cut of the prime rib roast off the american section and one piece of barbecue chicken also from the american section
well the night we checked in was the night that mattered the most my birthday so we decided to stay as we wouldnt be staying in there most of the trip anyway
the bathroom was so disgusting we were hesitant to take showers
its not exactly in shape and smells a little but this is what hipsters look for in a venue these days
we paid for an upgrade on the spot and they didnt give us the upgrade
we paid extra to check into our room right away after getting our keys and the maids were still cleaning it
after hearing people say so many good things about earl of sandwich i always thought to myself how could a sandwich be so good
smaller crowd and it was a lot of fun
in her favor here was one of her and she had at least 5 tables to tend to but she took care of 2 tables and forgot about the rest of us
they also have a shower  towels for anyone inclined
overall great vibe from the moment i walked in to the time we left way later than i should have for my morning meeting the next day shout out to kaylee their events coordinator for accommodating my large group
michael thank you thank you thank you
we have leftovers for a week
i am sure he had a good time listening to everyones conversation on the way there and back
what a relief to have such an organized and creative planner to help me with my wedding
i had to max out the volume just to hear anything
rooms good sized clean and cozybut a lot they can do with all that open space
the seats are comfortable but someone who has problems with heights may have issues
i ordered the charcuterie platter which was enough for 4 people ate it all myself
as i said it has presecco on tap
its located within the miracle mile shops by the casino
the timing for the different courses were completely off
great   scallops pretzel appetizer salmon kale salad only thing is its a bit high on the price side for lunch
being exhausted from the flight we asked if we could check in early  they not only let us they didnt charge a fee
all of our party rated the place a 25 out a possible 10  not worth the effort
although mine absolutely did not look like the original painting i was still proud that i did something like that
negatives   its a chain
the cocktail service was pretty reasonable
overall downtown vegas is dirty stinks and its the walmart of vegas
the pools and fitness areas are top notch
i think their main target clientele are gold diggers and the wannabe princesses
sessions are 15 minutes a piece but feel like a decade and should a birthday event be secured grub and beverages are inclusive in addition to cake
liked the filet bites burgers and salads
his name tag read hakeem destroyer of evil how professional is that
the hotel looks great new construction and has a great location
the boneless goat roti and veg roti are the best ive had in toronto
they assured me that they would so i went ahead and booked the room
i was most impressed with the suites comfortable setting and contemporary layout
came to las vegas for one night due to business got here at planet hollywood at 1100 pm after standing in the line for more than 45 minutes got the key to room around midnight from 800 am there is construction workers and banging and noise going on here  got up to tack a shower and get ready  there is no water in the room  so called the front desk and they say must be a not in your room that we are going true consultations and their will be no water in the rooms from 1000am to 300 pm  im so mad i cant even describe it right now  if your coming to vegas do not stay planet hollywood resort  casino  they would get your money and tell you oh sorry we assumed you would know  and if you bought your room from internet your screwed and you wont get compensation for your money and terrible experience
it is a novelty thing
besser geht nicht und wir haben dieses hotel whrend unseres aufenthaltes mit vielen anderen hotels in las vegas verglichen
best and beautiful latte
best part of palms was little buddha rain moon playboy club which is all gone now
first day was great beautiful upgrades and food was good
carolyn asked specifically if the tacos were on corn tortillas due to her gluten sensitivity and she was assured it was
we were in montreal for a visit and wanted 1 an affordable 100ca or lessnight place to hang our hats 2 a hotel close to the metro system 3 somewhere with an option to store the rental car for the time we were in town and 4 somewhere clean but not requiring any frills
when the sign says the city of entertainment you have no problem believing it
it is unlikely that the dog opened the door himself especially because the door opened inward and was a regular turn knob
gaming awful and awfuller blackjack
the same  night they had a wedding and outdoor reception was very nicely done
the beds were pretty comfortable but for a queen it seemed a little small
impressive 20 mins to start with amazing stage presentation and effects
what a waste of money and time
range work always awesome got some great tips to improve overall
our waitress was awesome nicole d
lastly tooties deliversto many zip codes
aside from laser tag they also have a small arcade area cafe concessions and a small private room for birthday parties
my friend and i got in hkkasan to see my girl eva shaw dj
the valet quickly transferred our luggage to a cart so off went into the hotel
und warum berhaupt besteht das salatbouquet nur aus drei salatblttern und zwei tomatenscheiben
noone caredeven a couple dead bugs in the room  i cant wait to get out of here i will not be returning and this is the first time ive ever said that about any hotel
the rooms are well appointed and the bed is very comfortable
the breakfast looks reasonable upon purchase but is far better at other budget hotels
very good trait in a server
die pancakes schwchelten dagegen leider etwas
we stayed here because it was the only 3 star hotel under 100 a room the night before new years eve
we adored the parador  its a really stunning old victorian that ed the owner has brought to life with a caribbean theme  totally different charming and unique
given downtown hotel prices you might want to skimp on some meals and the microwavemini fridge center makes that possible
i havent tried the included continental breakfast because i wish for other more to leave and get away from this place in the morning when i wake up
maybe your pizza maker thought we wouldnt be able to tell the difference between red peppers and sundried tomatoes
i love to converse with the little old gramas while theyre smoking and playing the penny slots
highlights include the raw bar the antipasti menu and the indooroutdoor seating
the rooms are in desperate need of renovation or a thorough cleaning
true the hooters casino is as poorly cleaned and maintained as one of their restaurants but the rooms were not quite so bad as the typical hooters restroom and one has to expect a certain griminess to go with the low room costs  that could potentially be some of the fun of the aesthetic that hooters touts i suppose
i was pleasantly surprised to see the food was affordable enough and they refill waters for free thank you
so when i called back all he could say was to bring it back
try the fish burrito i know it doesnt sound very good but trust me it is excellent
we are never going back to laughlin
i cant wait to come back and try the rest of the menu
it was absolutely disgusting
they deliver too
had the new york crepe and the venetia
we flew in for my birthday and got delayed to come here because my husband got sick
it says in the ledger line 21500 and 7300
this was my first time coming here and i was astonished by menu prices at restaurants
my consultant was clearly annoyed by the fact that i had brought an entourage of 5 family members to the appointment
i smashed every single rib
the club is buttery and moist and flavorfulcrisp veggies and crunchy bacon and yummy turkey
he was friendly warm welcoming and just seemed to honestly enjoy sharing his place with his customers
its the spa of hotels and i feel privileged to have stayed there
liquor store not over priced
thank you hopscotch for being so awesome
we had a great time touring the grounds and learning about wine but our favorite part was probably the tasting duh
this is a nice hilton grand vacation spot on the opposite end of the strip then where all the action is
but my wedding was exactly the way i imagined and i couldnt have asked for a better experience
i am so frustrated i will put this word out to everyone i can i do not want anyone i know or am connected with to ever spend one penny at ron decars event center
the zip line was awesome
the only  about the bathroom was that it was well lit
the bonus for me is that i live pretty close so as long as i dont ever stumble on to 16th street into oncoming traffic i could probably walk home
the rooms look way nicer in pictures than in reality
my daughter hasnt stopped talking about it all day
boy was i wrong
outdoor seating is plentiful and each table is covered by a tiki umbrella
best part of experience
after staying in a boutique hotel like the saint sulpice its hard to ever imagine staying in a hiltonmarriotchain ever again
all floors ceilings and walls are this modern concrete which offers zero sound absorption
just might be the best bbqbbq sauce ive had yet in the city im impressed
the furniture was chipped and ugly but the mattress was doable
the salmon for the 5course was not its forte but the rest of the dishes were good
again this is all just advice take it or dont we most certainly wont be returning to check up on your progress
naturally everything got screwed up and everyone was angry
yup they had the balls to do that
the pros to this hotel is its central location in room fridge shampooconditionerbath gel dispenser the off the strip  was convenient and the 24hr nook cafe
she is very fast to respond and is such a vibrant fun gal to work with
no good to my taste youd be better with cooking frozen wings in a microwave
we didnt have time to use them as much as i would have like to
and extra cheese
so after grabbing a stool at the bar spent some time pursuing the menu to see they carried about 6 different house beers with around 8 additional brews from other local breweries on tap
big plus was a visit to our table from talented chef beni
the scrambled eggs at the continental breakfast looked like a war crime and gave me diarrhea so bad two days ago that i couldnt leave the hotel until 4pm
honorable mention for rev
i really lucked out on this place
the only redeeming feature of this place is that it has a shockingly decent continental breakfast each morning
i know its hard to plan the outside conditions a year in advance but if you can possibly pull it off have the dinner outside or even just the cake
apparently the customer isnt right here
the salsa was flavorful and the chips were chips
for future cheapos like myself
the scallop dish was creative but the salt levels ruined it
maybe we should pay them to have a business
if i could give this place zeros stars i would
lets be real most people come to vegas or stay at cheap hotels on the strip because they are doing one thing getting so wasted they cant function
negatives thought for sure that i had booked one of their remodeled rooms but it just didnt seem that way i was expecting plush new and really luxurious room especially the bathroom and hallways could have been cleaner need more room amenities such as bath gel for the huge tub and inroom coffee could have done without a frig full of overpriced drinks and snacks on the counter just an empty frig please 25 resort fee plus 3 tax on the 25 resort fee when you dont use any of the benefits is crazy how about pay as you use and skip the blanket fee and while there were no problems at checkin except for the initial let me make a phone call to see if what you booked is available1 king vs 2 queens  what
from his incredible mentalism to comedy and audience participation paul does a wonderful job of engaging the audience and creating lasting memories
they were not overly breaded  were hot
ooh i dont know if they upgraded me without telling me but omg the room they gave me was wonderful
the ownerchef stopped at our table and told us all about the recipes
tv has a lot of channels and theres free internet
a little steep in price but worth it
or at least a tucked sheet that doesnt come off when you pull back the sheets
no wonder that store was never busy each time i stopped by and only got 2 yelp reviews
a popeyes chicken i regularly frequented and now gone at the hand of chickfila
even with a reservation made a week prior we walked in to be told the choices in rooms were limited
any other day that would have sounded good but i was on a mission
she never asked where the veggluten free people were so i was interrupted during my wedding dinner to find them
well i like mediterranean food a lot
sunshine food large pool family seems exciting right
the room we had was huge
i am extremely disappointed at this location not only does it look like its going to fall apart this ducked place has bed bugs i will never stay here again
the wings were ok not my favorite
i walked into the bedroom and noticed a used condom wrapper behind the door since i closed the door to change
pool has waterfalls great hot tub and they even have a lazy river
there were plenty of available poolside lounge chairs
reception is 24 hours so arrival time at the hostel is less of an issue when checking in
thinly sliced cherry tomatoes kept surfacing into my chips and the taste of broccoli in every bite was pleasantly unexpected
they beds are a little hard
a dozen happy breakfast eaters left the long table satisfied well fed  laughing september 2013 good coffee substantial portions very well prepared included great eggs benedict  in a light lovely lemony bernaise sauce  that old east coast nyc breakfast staple nova salmon toasted bagel wcapers tomato sliced onion
however the timeshare sales center also overlooks the pool
they do this right
they had another big flood that rushed down from mt
thanks kevin for making l things right
see you soon el segundo
the crew was friendly and outgoing
going to love the new digs
just avoid the post church crowd on sundays
now i have always thought the ladies of my former hometown austin tx to be some of the most lovely women on this planetbut after a night in charlotte i think i may have to reconsider that
i know coffee is not something someone should order at a bbq joint but at least you know ahead of time
3 old school 27 non hd tv
possibly the worst pulled pork i have ever been servedbasically boiled pork with no discernible smoke flavor nor for that matter much pork flavor
unlike some of the other reviewers we received great service from the staff
he made some suggestions for appetizers and for a main course after asking some questions about my event
ordered the jumbo gyros works with the gyro meat mainly beef and mixed with chicken
we pulled into valet  the valet was fullokay
parking is 20day
it is probably the second worst hotel i have ever been to
the chicken that comes with the dish was very rubbery
we had trouble with the shower water pressure but that got fixed quick
this is more or less when things quickly went downhill
yes you get a small bag of chips and small pickle slice with your sandwich but the price is to steep for me to make it a regular stop
if the rate were closer to 100125 per night it would have matched the hotel experience better
this was a nice hotel
i would like to stay here but the prices are higher than the other casinos
might not go back as often as i would like 9 for just a sub is out of my range
all i need to know is  1 can i rent a room
im not at that stage of my life yet so dont get any ideas but good to know for those that are
the jetted tub on our room looks as though its from the 70s huge off white with filthy jets
in the future when im looking looking for a cheap drink and gamble ill just stick to fremont street
that is amazing to me
there was some confusion on times for setup and clean up but after speaking with the sales director the entire situation was remedied
the ribs came in a basket lined with tin foil piping hot with a cup of water on the side
the swim pool area is just the greatest
my husband and i came here for some ice cream tacos and it was delicious
if youre going to eat there stick with south indian  sri lankan dishes
i had a good stay during jan 2008 ces show and took the advice below to ask for the premier tower paid extra 10
the decor of the rooms is a little more mediterranean vs southwestern as the decatur location is
it is high time for them to change or fix some of the furniture
susan is an amazing artist with the camera and i would agree with what someone else on yelp said about her she is down to earth
the rates were reasonable but everything like internet was an extra charge
we werent that high up but we didnt hear any of the music from the clubs below
we tried a few appetizers the calamari pizza roll and baked crab dip and the tomato vodka penne with sausage
classy upscale place
maybe because there were so many people at the winterfest event
this is understandable as we were in and out all day and im assuming housekeeping tried to come clean the room during the few times we were in the room
i dont like steak so i got to enjoy the farmhouse special or something with was bacon and eggs for about 3 or 4
the front desk folks were friendly and competent
i hope management reads this and contacts me id be happy to give them advice about how their staff should be treating their paying customers
just another casino mexican place with the same old food
the front desk is extremely friendly and helpful
be prepared to pay big bucks for a close seat
the eggs are fabulous
he refuses to stay there ever again
carpe diem has the best fried chicken in north carolina
you may ride a gondola down the canals
ive eaten at each place multiple times
i absolutely love al pastor and theirs is my new fave
even setting it at 65f it was still warm in there
we had our wedding and reception at the university club
however with that comes the main downside  while a 400 square foot room is adequate for a short stay id advise anyone to upgrade if they are staying longer or look for a deal elsewhere
shouldnt cost 1 to call the hotel that i could literally see from my window friends staying there
okay so i didnt actually stay here but i should have
took 30 minutes for someone to come take our drink order
the staff is friendly and extremely helpful place is beautiful and well kept and the rooms are quite spacious for a hgi
really nice chill hotel
so worth it
i wish pasto di forno much continued success
after much searching we settled on great wall as our favorite  place for a basic chinese meal
we went down to the pool and saw rafts were 10 but once they saw our room card they said they were free for us
6 on top of all the above they charge a resort fee
after coming back from a early dinner and trying to relax it is a resort thats usually what they are for we were subjected to the child above us running around close to two hours
look at the final charge that is resort charge plus room charge
everything was fine and i had no real complaints but for a full service hotel it seemed uninspired
the decor was lovely and super glitzyglamorous
minus poor gastons mic issues on opening night of beauty and the beast
awesome hotel and friendly staff lily at the reception especially
since theres three hotels that make up the palms youll never really be bored there
the best hotel i have stayed at on the strip by far
i also listened to another game of telephone as the crew tried to figure out when the last call was supposed to be
i will never stay here again
i actually slept very well during my stay which is not typical
we got a back of the house tour a complimentary craft project for the kiddos and while we never took advantage of it they had childcare for kids 4
i explained to her that it would not be enough shade and my sister needed more coverage
awesome early morning date though
i need coffee every morning and granted most hotel coffee is bad but at least its available
walters to tell me what exactly was going to happen then when 4pm hit as i was standing outside the door with my dad i had to take several deep breathes as the tears began to flow
its the closest thing ive experience to being in a ghost town
but instead of staying through the music we left that morning
omg the best i was like what am i eating
so booking in advance pays
we had the demimondaine and it was huge
great service too although the three valets didnt notice my car pull up at 2 am even after honking
i cant speak for the coffee since they carry one of my favorite sodas dr bowns black cherry try it youl like it and i tend to order that over coffee
however with the cost and reputation of westin i definitely felt like the quality of this hotel was far below the expected standards
i have had this restaurant cater three different events in the past year
its so close to the notre dame basilica
we attended an afternoon wedding here and it was definitely an experience
the gallery is the top balcony and it was designed for children or people who are vertically challenged
second the venue itself is gorgeous from the lobby to the guest rooms very clean and updated
however theres always something thats just a bit off or missing that surprises me
it was only was supposed to be a 2 night stay thats it
everything is absolutely beautiful
here goes to start our cross country trip from california to south carolina my husband and i wanted to start our trip in style and not only celebrate our big 3000 mile journey but also my husbands 50th bday so i booked our 2 night stay at the four seasons
they have a wii to play on little kids room clean bathroom with febreeze
the tower i stayed in was lovely
the prime rib sandwich is to die for
the girls said they enjoyed chateau as well
the class room is located inside the range 702 and has a camera eyeinthesky so all personal belongings are safe as well as the door is constantly on lock during the short breaks
housekeeping was super nice and offered us more supplies even though we werent having our room cleaned
the chocolate mousse was in my sisters opinion the most chocolatiest thing in the world
and why does the hotel lobby smell like sewer all the time
i would have loved to explore the hotel more
nice if youre not going to be hanging at the hotel most of the time but next time im back to ceasars
mine sprayed a wide area causing the floor outside of the tub to get wet
ive left the valley officially as of last week and was sad to go
not to mention the stains on the mattress and box spring  so gross
a small feature that i thought was cool was the do not disturb sign is  digitally controlled by a button with a light up led in front
and you got the promade
then he told me it was crown out of a gun  not even a bottle
the service is great and the drinks are even better
night club check
then i get a text back saying omar was in an accident 2hrs prior when i physically spoke to omar less then an hour ago
i loved it but didnt finish
49 for a room on a weekend isnt bad at all
francee was the agent and i would highly recommend them
ok let me say this about stratosphere if you want to stay at a place that doesnt make your bed or take your garbage out then this place is for you
almost like a chain here
i was told that the room is nicer as it faces the pool but i wasnt told just how far it is from the casino and the strip
i will never go back
the portions are unnecessarily gigantic
i couldnt even get through the first one wo throwing in the towel
sure our bill for two was north of 80 but we left with a ton of leftovers and were very satisfied with the meal and experiencequality isnt cheap
it gives you so much stuff to aim for
im a fan
their tacos their drinks their staff
dont expect fancy but do expect to pay less
eggs benedict were also served but with a 10minute wait
great service and food
it was completely without warning and our suite did not have a no housekeeping necessary today sign for us to put out to help us be prepared but it was still fine
the good  upon check in they gave me tickets for either free drinks or free continental breakfast
he placed me on hold but i thought he was going to help fix the problem from the tone of his voice and indication he would be checking on that
everyone ordered a full breakfast and everyone enjoyed it immensely
so we were seated outside promptly
on the grounds there is a day spa restaurant courtyard areas pool and a bar
nothing wrong with sls
obviously my previous statement means this following review applies only to the happy hour menu and service
having free wifi was also pretty cool too
dickeys is normally really good
great atmosphere stiff drinks and the kale salad is very tasty
they sent the confirmation with two adults instead of three even after discussing over phone and sending email about three adults
room furniture extra seating and tables  housekeeping they were amazing and cleaned so well each morning  awesome food  beverage promo they offered  easyfast check in  friendly employees we didnt care for  the location we love walking everywhere and its just farther from things  no one told us only one pool area would be open it was freezing but still despite all the things we loved the distance from everything else is just a deal breaker
attention he is amazing
dont be afraid to ask for help at the mlife help desk
the room position was perfect
they really were saggy in the middle and the box spring edges poked me when i sat on the side of the bed
i didnt realize it until i tried to fly home
double tree really knows hospitality
he was awesome
not a big deal but worth noting
fav sandwich for now is the roast beef and turkey aka full montagu
i checked out around 6 am in the lobby and the receptionist was very pleasant in conversation
the only reason i am giving any star is for the young man who came to the room to bring me the sheets and the missing hospitality items
if i come to the area again i would consider staying here again
the look  feel  location of the hotel is great but the customer service sucks
as far as comfort goes there are intercontinentals that may be better designed and have nicer gyms or restaurants that is even  true of the intercontinental hotel also on the cleveland clinic campus which is clearly the more posh property however what this suites hotel might lack in those expected niceties it more than makes up for for the things that matter to customers in residence  proximity to the cleveland clinic right at the campus being a stop on the cleveland clinic shuttle route and having a friendly and accommodating staff that is accustomed to anticipating and meeting the needs of family members and patients themselves who will likely be returning to the hotel for some days to continue recovery
i loved the high angled ceilings in the lobby as well as the pool area  this gives it a great design look from the outside
decor  the decor in the room isnt anything too snazzy or swanky but it is modern appealing and ultimately comfortable
requesting extra towels or blankets took 3045 minutes
they have a bunch of illegal workers there who speak no english and the guy workers are soooo creepyits not safe at all to say the least i would never recommend this place to anyone it was one of the worst experiences ive ever had with any place i have stayed stay clear of this place its horrible
it was lovely and for our sandwiches we chose egg and salmon
well it is a casino and the reason i wasnt notified is because its independently owned and not part of the other clubs where im a member ie
no one wants to listen to girls whine about other employees while they assemble my burrito or mutter under their breath when theyre restocking the forks
aria is nice
on the first night we were there my friends and i arrived back at our room around 4am from wandering around the strip
i tried to wait out the smell and noise but finally had enough at 9pm and called down to the front desk to request to be moved
the restaurants are good the layout was great service was friendly and people who complain about this place must be nitpicky
the amount of fries was enormous
and most of the machines are the ones where you bet by number of pay lines
the bar is fun cute intimate bar a circle of course plenty of flirty guys
the flatbread is a bit hard to cut
also forget about bringing breakfast to the room for the family unless you are an octopus or a creature with multiple arms because they do not have trays to carry the food
the oysters were good not gritty at all but there were a few staple accouterments that were missing tabasco and crackers
we also had a mixed greens salad with goat cheese which was nothing special not good not bad
the space is beautiful an amazing combination of classy and relaxing
the restaurant in the hotel
i would recommend this place if youre in the area for breakfast
great atmosphere and party environment a must for any sports fan visiting charlotte nc
the rest i would just skip
i really like the ice cream and the cookies were amazing they had just been baked
we love dining here and our son loves live music nights
i kept getting lost
it was super crunchy and had lots of flavor
highly recommend them
and on warm nights its refreshing because you can feel the water spray and it makes you really cool off too
i cant wait to go back this time in the summer so i can try out the pool
i know its typical of the casino hosts in downtown to be total cheap bastards but these guys officially are the cheapest bastards in vegas
our waitress was attentive and got everything right
i dont care at this point how great or awful her pictures are  she never showed up and really didnt care that i scheduled my day off from work for this appointment and she just blew me and my family off
really convenient location but lack of social wind down like springhill offers would make an attached bar a really nice option
my wife and i ordered  goat stew waakye gari and salad  banku kenkey and talapia  stuffed zucchini with peanut butter sauce this goat was very chewy barely edible
but most importantly the micheladas were def on point
go there now
the pork belly and brisket tacos were amazing
i was a broke teenager with lavender hair who carried picket signs and fronted a rock band 13 when i woke up i was very different twenty something
i wish there would have been compensation
on my contract it stated the type of cake and a picture to show how it should have looked
stuff i may need in the future but dont think ill use for a while so i didnt buy them i got a bunch of buttons thread for my sewing machine rhinestones iron on ones and punch on ones and sew on ones i used professional glue before on my clothing but they fell out after a wash so i wash by hand now on the items i glued on  i spent almost 200 cause this store is so far away i wanted to stock up cause who knows when ill come back around here
tonight i was given even more reasons to love it
while i did not break out at the patch test before the massage took place which didnt allow enough time anyway i did start itching while dining at distrito afterwards
i checked into a one bedroom suite yesterday and was blown away
it felt like they had nothing else to do but take care of us despite having many other weddings that day
went to hash hash a go go twice for breakfast this was pretty good
yeshowever having known me for 9 months you know that i do not normally drink so much and i am certainly of no threat to anyone
only drawback i think would be that was my guest and i had to climb stairs to get to their second room at the location had they have elevators everything would have been perfect
this is quite a new place on the edinburgh scene and it was badly needed
you can also control the curtains blinds ac  lights on the light stand next to the bed
check in was quick and efficient even though they had a line
very happy with the whole experience
our room on this past visit was a standard room that was comfortable clean and everything we needed
simple purchase with minimal service fees through brown paper ticket
after my pretzelgazm i was offered up the skirt steak with green beans bacon and fingerling potatoes
they  have made our stay much more comfortable during a time of stress for us
we needed gluten free and we got a layer of lemon cake with raspberry filling and one layer with carrot cake
the overhead screens entertaining and downtown has low limit training wheel tables
when we got to our room the ironing board was broke
their loss is my gain
this is absolutely the last hole you want to land in i paid for a room with two beds just to have place to rest and met a friend on the strip who needed to crash and i offered my extra bed
when we needed a taxi they called for us and were there in a flash
i really wish i had a different hotel as part of my package but alas i had this place
good views of the mountain and strip
they do not have queen beds
the food is ok and no so great and veg lo mein was only thing that tasted good
we loved that it had a tv in each room
i did not think the wifi worked very well it did not work every time
it can get a little cold in the theater
the prices were extremely reasonable especially considering the very high quality food and service we received
he asked when so i check out i told him the following day he said someone will be in contact with me before i check out
the real problem with this place is the housekeeping staff
there were 2 tables of ladies and each table had 2 pots so we got to try a lot
we just smiled and walked out and he just kept looking at us funny and told us well be kicked out of the hotel if that happens again
we should have known when we had to inform our waiter that the restaurant had a corkage policy
i placed my order nearly 2 months in advance and relaxed
notes on the hangers about robes but no robes
i recently stayed here for a conference and i really enjoyed my stay
the service has never been amazing bad twice that we left cash on the table without ever getting the check
italian wedding soup tasted and looked like chicken and stars with a few meatballs thrown in
we went for michael sonatas frank sinatra tribute and we were all pleasantly surprised
i was just at the palazzo over the weekend for an anniversary and about a month out when i made the reservation i checked and the agent made my reservation for the following month
as we were approaching people were allowed to walk through the pathway and we were going with the flow of traffic
after checkingin and arriving to the room i realized they didnt give me go room and in fact downgraded me to an absolutely hideous room with the most awful smell for the price of the go room
in no time at all i was checkedin and into my room
the pretzel fondue was crazy good as was the wednesday special meatloaf
a few earlier reviewers described being bored during the show and id like to say i personally dont know how this is possible
she wouldnt even give me eye contact and i could see in her face that she was just trying to put on some act to blow me off
ka was my second cirque du soleil show
sw restaurant is great and  wing lei is pretty good if you want a more casual meal
all in all thursdays are fun and make for an affordable way to get from 0 to drunk before 8pm
that is normally a blessing but at this place it gives the nazi security staff members your personal undivided attention
the fries came out first and was just a feast for the eyes
in the mens there is a shower stall
we got a good deal on groupon for a 2 night stay with a king size bed
prices are average to high reminding one that this is definitely a tourist spot
check your total rewards hotel rates right up until the night youre going to stay
the driver and attendant on board both were great
ive stayed at a bunch of hotels on the strip and i always compare to wynn  encore as the benchmark
she did not understand
the rooms are dated
in addition to these major issues the hotel elevator was filthy
he ensured me everything is always looked over and the machines are maintained to high standards
he worked on the 2 air conditioning units quickly and without making a mess
this is a great place to watch sporting events and hang with your friends and even meet other people
they were prompt with the car but when we came down my keys were sitting on the dash with my windows open and they were busy tending to all the wedding guests so anyone could have easily walked right up and taken my car
there is parking behind the building i was just unfortunate enough to make my way there just as a thunderstorm was rolling in
this place certainly did not deliver on the above
we pulled up and the owner dan opened the door for us and greeted us
our tour guide was wonderful
the location is fantastic  couldnt really ask for a more convenient spot with easy access to whole foods target starbucks tons of restaurants and a nice outdoor mall within 12 miles
the food here never disappoints
tammy rode with us and she was a lot of fun and easy to get along with
overall an average hotel experience for the strip
we stayed in the standard room
i keep telling myself tht if i go back to vegas i will visti their buffett
my husband wanted to order another one for the road before we left lol
we ordered the walleye chowder squash  apples and the steak sandwich   all delicious and very reasonably priced
got the montague and the earl club
the curtains in the room were 2 different lengths on the same window and i wouldnt walk barefoot on the carpet
you may have had to walk but it was all contained on premisses
the beef ribs are the best  tender juicy and meaty
very clean easy navigation from the airport
no elevator but nice clean hallways
if youre not that interested in the casinoside of vegas and have a car then stay here if you can
they do have a complimentary valet but there was only one guy working when i pulled up
the rooms are gorgeous
since it was not near the strip the traffic was a lot quieter
the tv welcomes you with your name on the screen and has all the different restaurants and ect on the screen
however this hotel was literally the worst hotel experience i had in a very long time
im pretty much a taco expert since im from la where there are taco trucks everywhere
it was literally across the other side of the hotel from us and took about two minutes just to get to it
at a 5 star hotel
i attended a wedding here as a best man and left my 250 plus oakley sun glasses and was told to come pick them up coordinator remembered them and knew exactly where they were held  when went  to pick them up they could not find them apparently they have employees who are criminals and steal things and are allowed to get away with it and this place does not care what so ever and just wants your money and whatever the employees can steal  stay far far far far away from this place as not worth it and they are way over priced especially since the people that run this place steal things and are dishonest
the appetizers were delicious shrimp chicken skewers sliders and the main course portions were huge we had lobster and steak
the porter yelled at one of family to get out of the way then hit her foot with the luggage
completely run down
we were pleasantly surprised upon opening the door to our room
we ordered their drink special blueberry lemonade a cappuccino and a regular coffee along with two of their scones
i would recommend her to everyone and anyone i know
excellent restaurants and staff
with a very reasonable rate while we were here i would be hardpressed to consider something else nearby
go there  tell them kevin sent you
the computer system that controls everything  crashed twice causing the room to be dead and uncontrollable for 10 minutes at a time
our room is nicely renovated  the building is quaint and takes you back to the vegas of the past
die speisen sind absolut lecker mit frischen zutaten eben ganz nach dem geschmack von bella italia
will definitely recommend this place and come back when i come back to phoenix
if youre in dire need of a room in vegas this isnt a bad place to stay
the explanation we were given was on the lines of it is our policy that bla bla bla you get the point
always encourage my friends and family to try it out atleast onetwo nights of their stay
the parking lot is scarydark and old theres two parking lotsi left my car i saw a lot of cars had dents  scratchesalso i get the theme is about circus but like cool it down on the clowns theyre literally even plastered on the parking walks
1 staff at all of the food courts were super nice and friendly as well as housekeeping  2 lots of food selection from inexpensive to a little expensive
the drinks had the right amount of alcohol to where you didnt feel like you were drinking juice nor did you feel like they were over powering
the panini bread was warm crispy and perfect with every bite of cheese meat and vegetable
reasons are listed below 1 there is not hair dryer in the room
hats off to this chef
it seemed like any other strip club ive been to so i wasnt that impressed
you see my daughter is normally happy go lucky
nice and moist with buttercream frosting
is mirage not able to compete with all the new hotels
altogether the place was mediocre for the price if it werent for the hassle and the roaches id stay again
the sandwich is just put together perfectly
i got another room and behold the toilet does not work again
not too impressed by the pool though for such a big resort area i thought the pool was very very small
the pool area is pretty small but the atmosphere is really fun
living in the boonies and far from everything will create appreciation like that haha
twice a year my company throws me in this hotel when i go to the sema car show  ces show for work
nice selection of restaurants  nearly no smoky smell it is a casino afterall  the rooms have recently been remodeled  are very comfy  roomy for the price
we are platinum spg  guests but we did book a prepaid lowest guaranteed rate so maybe thats why the cruddy room we were placed in a preferred guest room  but it had no view just a massive tree blocking the golf course and desert we so desired to see
minus one star because the menu did not specify bacon was on the dish i ordered and because a cheese crisp should never be 5 even though it was pretty big
therefore made no complaints
in a word none
this alone should be a good reason for choosing to stay here
lovely view to wake up to
visited for dinner on june 12  floor in dining area was absolutely filthy
the food was very good and the beer was cold
delicious food excellent wait staff
the bbq here is good
once i figured it outhaha
is there an additional amount i can pay to check in at 130pm
so imagine my surprise when i was charged 20 a day for a resort fee
all of the staff i came into contact with were very nice and helpful
the service is great the decor is gorgeous and the place seems like brand new
we stayed her based on the reviews we found online and it met our expectations
i requested a fridge due to health reasons and one was brought up right away which rocked
we were the only people at the bar besides a server eating dinner next to me at the bar
hotel rooms are for sleeping and storing your things and with a location like this and decent accommodations ballys hits it right on the mark
love this cute boutique hotel
the brisket is more like roast beef that the fabled texas bbq brisket
the staff was nice and maria cleaned bathroom after mess and changed shower lining
i can not wait to stay again in a few weeks
my pineapple coconut ice cream with macadamia was such an awesome combo
3 the goods
the pics turn out great and you have lasting cool memories
one quick down side
worry about my little call  redamndiculous
additionally i waited in a huge ass line at the cafe outside of the elevators for a quick hot breakfast quiche on the menu only to find out after 20 mins of waiting that they only had pastries
if im back in the phxscottsdale area ill definately use again
dropped by here after work to meet some colleagues
well he must be like this all the time
i ended up going to the 22md floor trying to figure out how to use it
the story is great and the cirque du soleil crew was at its best again
pork was decent and smoked turkey as well
that said they did a great job of remodeling the place giving it a retro boutique feel
there was no do not disturb sign so we had to go ask for it ourselves
i cant wait to bring them back for more fun
if you want a small mid strip location this is the place
need comfy room
the sales manager followed up with me and really didnt have anything to say except for she wished that i would have found her to tell her about the ac unit
it was absolutely ridiculous and so wildly unprofessional
my spirit fell when i saw the slide was closed but luckily it opened up later on
i took my belgian sheepdog in for a photo shoot in the studio and at the bark park to do agility and outdoor photos
and a tennis court below but if we looked over there was a nice view of the strip and in particular the bellagio fountains
my advice if you want to travel up and down the strip call lyft
we are coming back for sure
no casino or any show at this place but the night view of the strip from the hotel lobby or the bar is magnificent
however the whole meal was horribly marred by the substandard customer service
they have some great cake flavors and i generally find myself making some very tough decisions when i stop in for a cupcake
i threw the 50 down
i loved the low key storyline and the amount of audience participation
good overall im torn about our convention center here in phoenix
this is definitely not the cheapest italian restaurant ive been to but i think the prices are reasonable for the large portions and quality that you get
the bathroom was pretty big and the shower was great
you must try the 54 chicken
my son actually complained he never complains
this has been going on for almost an hour
on my second stay my room was around the designated quiet pool and it was a much calmer scene
furthermore she was unable to answer my question about whether or not the hallmark rewards program application could be completed online
if you care about gambling pick somewhere else that will make it fun
no one has been working on the issue
wed have to go through each channel one by one to see what was on tv
she wanted the yellow label but i didnt give it to her
checking in youll notice how incredibly gorgeous the lobby is
it fits perfectly in between
if we have a thousand dollars of credit why did you not just deduct it
despite my negative first experience here i found myself back recently and we actually enjoyed dining here
we werent in the room much
that is saying something because they build something newer and better every year
that was cool
lots and lots of slots
baked goods are very moist and tasty
plenty of nice restaurants to choose from and places to lounge which i will review separately
the hotels lobby seems more like a high end bank than a hotel
food containers starbucks cups trash all over the place
we came because someone in our party has a coupon
the soup is great
i would just go to the venetian next door which has a bigger casino
they were very entertaining
it is a few miles off the interstate in a technologicalbusiness section of town but totally worth the short drive
not bad clean price was decent panera restaurant attached made it nice close to downtown without the high price would stay here again when in pittsburg
on occasion the lodging has been quite remarkable
you know a photographer is good when they can make an ordinary object look like a piece of art
it was very inconvenient
5 the costumes are festive and catches your attention 6 wherever you sit you are going to have a great view
instead they offered us two rooms on opposite sides of a floor which doesnt help us much given were traveling with our two young kids  eventually we settled on a one bedroom suite with a pull out couch in the parlor where the couch looks and feels like it might have been barely comfortable about a decade ago  this room also had a totally dead phone a sometimes working tv and worse of all an air conditioning system which sounds like a hammer hitting an anvil every time the ac turns off
the shopping was pretty minimal though with only a hermes chanel rock and republic and a few other stores
this past weekend i stayed at the mirage on friday and didnt have a plan for saturday night
will take my business to a competitor next time
the chicken patty appeared to be one that you would get when you buy them by the hundreds from a food service company
little did i know that within 15 minutes there was a line up of 20 people down the street just a couple minutes after the 1030 mark
people are nice
it was close to the airport and they had a shuttle come pick us up
all in all i hope to be back soon
i reserve the right to come back and change this
the legend of the flamingo continues i personally love this place
the pool area is gorgeous but other than that everything is a bit outdated
great decor not usually busy perfect outdoor and indoor reading spots and delicious coffee
the level of experience and love for what she does shows so much in her work its incredible
these items fit us perfectly and made the event fun and feel like it was truly catered just for us
we got our car out of valet to drive down to the neon museum do it but other than that pretty much walked everywhere
its way too long with poles obstructing view
the breakfast burritos were awesome
we loved it
it didnt seem like he knew how to encourage his team and motivate them to do their best
it is true the new casinos are in debt so not many people will win
this is the one place i can grab gelato and a purse all in one walk
a week later my husband sees that his account was charged another 3248 for their resort fee
after walking in with an obvious shocked look on my face i was assured that our king suite was modern and renovations were already made
its hard for me to review this place because i absolutely loathe these sort of clubs
the only reasons i cant do 5 stars was the photo quality was not high and we had to wait for 20minutes past time
the hibiscus margarita was a little too sweet for me but if you like it on the sweet side go for it
a local favorite in fountain hills
additionally it is located behind a gentlemens club
the location of our west wing room was much more convenient to getting to the bus the tix 4 tonight location and other places on the strip
good staff good fb great course and very good practice area
first off its one of the cheapest if not the cheapest main hotels on the las vegas strip
800am thank god i have a avis rental i head up the strip towards 15
this is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere downtown phoenix
first time here great staystaff is great and extremely helpful
i think they need to perfect one technique and go with it
its unbelievable the such great food and atmosphere can be found in vegas at such good prices
they have a nice selection of restaurants on the promenade level
so i said so no discount
there was a wide variety of breakfast options  waffles breakfast sandwiches yogurt cereal etc
i search for occasions for which to make a reservation here reservations are a must as this place is packed and i have waited 45 minutes for a table beforeworth it though
this place is aok for a quick casual meal
after youre done shopping head next door to bloom for a cupcake
when i went to pick up my tickets as will call they initially couldnt find them
seems like everybody is frustrated at vegas nice clean room and a very comfortable bed
i am not sure if i would pay full price since nothing really stand out and menu price was a bit on the pricey side
it was warped tour so it was a little busy but we sat at the bar and the bartender didnt tell us until we tried to get her attention that there were still people sitting there
the servers were attentive but not overbearing
the food came and we had to wait to eat it because of this
excellent experience great accommodations very staff very professional
the cold food was laid out on round tops while the hot food what in the typical buffet chafing dishes
rude rude rude
both suites could accommodate 4 people each if not more with a foldout sofa
the tub was hella tall
no problem so we went to lunch and enjoyed some shopping
this time i tried the cabbage soup base to see if i would like it too sweet not my thing so i ordered their chicago dog with sauerkraut  gross
sneaky bouchon bistro
the food was delicious and the portions are huge
ive signed up with them online and i am making this my hotel of choice when travel
i am over 23 of the way to diamond status myself and they could not give us a room upgrade for our patronage or my birthday
made me appreciate their card trick even more
stuff like keith richards nudie suit a couple johnny cash guitars a smashed pete townshend guitar etc
maid service was good
the food was uneven
i love all their breads
very pricey in the spring training season but the weather is great
but there is no excuse for a business that instructs its employees to lie to the customers
the rooms here are huge and the staff is very nice
its city center location is really convenient
the guy at the desk was rude and i had to ask him what the final cost was after he already ran my card then ask for my receipt then ask where i could place my bags until the room was ready
you never have to get in your car
the hotel itself was okay i guess
i bought a timeshare on one trip because i was happy with my previous trips
palazzo is my all time favorite hotel to stay
he followed us upstairs where i called his bluff and said if this isnt the master key than it wont work when i try it in the neighboring door when i went to try it he grabbed my hand and the key ad kept screaming at me he opened our room shoved us inside and said get your stuff and leave or stay i dont care
bonus points for having the two takeoutpickup spaces in the parking lot
great and big casino
it didnt take away too much from the overall production as there is much more to the production than fight scenes
the signs say theyre still open for business but id have to disagree
my sandwhich was
they have all sorts of knickknacks you would usually find in these kind of stores  the whole knockknock line of sarcastic postits those cute little dolls dressed in kimonos tiny voodoo dolls yummysmelling candles and lotions a decent selection of ironic books and hilarious greeting cards i could go on for hours
while the young staff did make a few errors during my stay they more than compensated for these with a positive attitude prompt communication and a willingness to address my concerns
manager of spa offered her breakfast while i was having my treatment
its been awhile since ive been to a dominos so i thought i would stop by this location since i was in the area
my husband ordered the ribeye medium rare
we both had the salmon special
as a thank you to my team i decided to take everyone out and wished i hadnt thought of his place
i asked for help from one of the dealers and the said put the service light on
it was stll good but i have no idea what i got but i feel sorry for the person who got my order
i was then informed that my reservation was canceled and i had to rebook
of course this could be because i was touring the rosson house this saturday with six european tourists
its sad to know that  the people who took over such a nice casino are douch bags
full bar including beers wines and spirit
i have a tendency to go to a lot of concerts
i dont really get it
first the food
let me also addno coffee makers in roomso you will be standing in long lines every morning to pay 6 for one cup of coffee
i have always paid a reasonable price for staying here
i recently moved closer to this area and have been wanting to give lucis a try
then what made me never want to go back there again is the fact that in the end i asked for my receipt for my corp cc and the girl constantly repeated herself over and over again in an obnoxious tone that i just told her to stop talking
i thuoght the stage was a bit small when compared to my imagination
long story short a lot of things went wrong including me having to switch hotels and flight issues
once our order was finally taken we waited over 35 minutes for our dinner
if you were to order this meat from a butcher it would run you about 138 a pound which is why the small portion you get is 13 but it is amazing and the only place in town that i know serves it
we were told they were out of brisket
overall your typical buffet
i watched rates on vegas hotels for months in anticipation of a romantic vacation with my boyfriend
the hotel is a haven for the hallucinogenic mushroom trippin fans
defiantly eat here agin
then for add ons we did the smallest package so that we could get some on site photos after our ceremony
the only plus was the oyster bar which tasted amazing and i will be writing a separate review for
all personnel were helpful and friendly
had a mini fridge and microwave
im a fan of the medsalad and i add salmon and often will split if im there with a girlfriend
but my friends and i were in our early 20s so we were a bit disappointed to see a bunch of people way older than us
my wife was basically called a liar over this
best djs and coordinating team ever
the evening meals also complimentary held every second monday and every tuesday and wednesday are pretty basic but not bad for free example  burger sliders potato salad carrot and celery sticks and cookies
we get back in line after 3 and another staff member with an attitude tells us that the room is not ready and that she cannot or will not give us an estimated wait time
this hotel is a few miles from the airport
we were just searching for some decent hawaiian food outside of the cal and we decided to check this place out
she really has the most unique cutest stuff and is always adding new unique things
we walked to the check in area on the left but i must say the area was pretty unimpressive
but if you are late they have coffee available in lobby
the next day they still had no rooms available that we had booked
arrived at 230 am to a lobby which was decorated with a modern flair
one quick note the mini bar in most mlife properties bellagio aria etc etc uses sensor technology so if you pick something up for more than 30 seconds whether you consume it or not you will be charged for that item of course you can dispute any false charges upon checkout
was in phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament
in room safe and flat screen tvs add to the quality
we love treehouse and the friendly staff
overall this hotel has a lot of nice features in theory but not in practice
i will admit that it is often a bit overhyped
the staff were not only professional but passionate about what they do
limoz was the only limo entity to support elementary students with a special limo ride as a grand prize incentive for our school fundraiser
i walked all the way to the opposite side of the casino to tell the front desk and they told me to walk all the way back upstairs at 3am to get my id
i am excited to go back and try something different
everything was totally fresh the flavors were delicious and even though i had this at the sunset parkd food festival and things were pretty darn busy the food came out really quickly and was cooked to perfection
southside works gives you three newspapers aboveaverage coffee a sink in the kitchen area a bathtub not just a shower stall etc etc
i highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a great make up artist you will not be disappointed
these days dry tough chicken 70 bone on the large tips
my friend said the raspberry chocolate cupcake was just average
their service is always speady food is always fresh and the customer service is great
they all looked happy to be there
18  12 tax
i had the fiesta plate
also the timeshare people in the lobby that are dressed just like the other employees are very aggressive compared to other hotels on the strip
room service was outstanding and attention to detail was perfect
great views  intresting people
it wasnt perfect but it was awesome
you are right next to the mall there is a little bridge to walk over and its the fashion mall
i have had much better at much lesser restaurants
the room was clean and the staff was nice
ill attach some photos to this review
you can hear everything
grilled cheese to die for
our choice for our dinner was spaghetti and meatballsnice size portionand my husband had the rigatoni robertaits made with egg plantwe brought left overs homeit was very good
all in all i feel like my two hours were wasted my money was wasted
i dont mind paying for excellence but this place is awesome so why pay more
it was like a night club for families in the pool
they even had a hot girl bartending
the pools are ok  very very shady
my favorite casinohotel in vegasits sexy and cool as hell
nice customer service
i went here recently for the 10th anniversary of paper bag records in which they had 5 bands playing on the night it was my 2nd trip to this venue
i am not huge on reviews in the first place i will do them for restaurants because i know how much they can impact a business good or bad
beds are hyatt quality soft and cozy
this place was great good value for the cost
directions to elevators were not clear and quite confusing
but its still worth it just to have access to shorter bar lines and a bathroom with no line
service has seemed really slow the past few times weve been
we checked in wanted a king all they had was 2 queen in the pyramidokgot into the room it looked like house keeping didnt even vacuum or change the sheets
room great food is horrid
i liked the laidback nosmoking nogaming atmosphere but with all of that in walking distance
on the other hand beautiful rooms
ill stay here again due to the combination of location and price but there are quite a few things that they can do in order to improve the experience
however if you happen to check in during this time it is a pain in the neck to trek all of your luggage through this drunk crowd
the room was clean and i found extra pillows in the drawers for the pullout couch
bed bugs a pool  spa filled with stagnant water and microwaved eggs for breakfast what more dould you ask for in a cheap hotel
the tough part about our trip was that we have a 100 pound black lab with us and its tough to find accommodating hotels
dont see how anyone can go wrong here
check this place out
valet was full while we were there so we valeted at the hotel a block up
they dont want to give you a coffee pot because they want you to buy a coffee from their coffee shops and charge 4
when i told him that this strange particular mosquito that he was hinting at only had the temerity to start attacking me once i was in the room in bed and under the sheets he finally suggested that he inspect the room
the staff here is extremely rude with no customer service skills
its one of the cheaper meals youll find by the strip and open
lots and lots of slots
all in all a must visit for anyone going to charlotte
aside from all that the pool was nice so was the lazy river
i chose to do the all you can eat sliders after being told about it by the waiter
spent a lot of money to book a suite and asked for early checkin
a few things to know about this particular pool the pool brings out a fun crowd that changes from the morning through the afternoon
not sure if this is common but i barely put any force on it
prices dont seem high at all to me but i live in la where you can run up a tab of 300 for two people without much effort
and there during the day when temperatures are around 110 degrees there is plenty of lemon water fresh towels and floaties
if you are going to talk about your customers dont do it when they are standing right there
ok everything that people are complaining about is probably true
this pretty much effed us as we needed to checkin and pay for another hotel on sunday and everything had been budgeted ahead of time
not a great place to come on a diet
the customer service was excellent the check in and check out was very easy and stress free
but the hotelrooms at venetian mgm and trump and hilton grand vacation were much nicer
we thought itd be 90 minutes it ended up taking nearly 45 hours including the shuttle ride to and from our hotel
i was scared the rest of the meal would head in the direction of the salads but luckily that was not the case
also the shower had a sliding class door  with the toilet part exposed  so everyone could see you pee
plus it is across the street from the gold coast casino which has the best chinese food
whenever i stay in vegas i always look to the palazzo and venetian first and i recommend you do as well
and this was my impression before one photo was taken
prices are pretty fair if not low and those are the starting prices
its unfair to hold this against them but i will cause its my review
i like how they accomidate to large party good spot will always go here
now for the lesser   i had the veal matteos with pasta side
it was much too hot for me to do any lounging except while submerged in water but i was fine with that
tried it tonight with the family in n phx location picked up and took home delish
452017 once again rubios is fantastic
leading up to the day lindsay and jacqueline handled a lot of the planning
they just punch 500 into the register
patterson can provide linen and china for your reception
sadly the fab rooms do not have a coffee maker so we had to trek to the lobby every morning to buy a 3 cup of coffee
this waitress provides such poor service i had to walk over to the bartender order a drink and tipped him well
i mentioned that my window blind was broken and asked if there were some way to fix it
the only reason that the radisson hotel cleveland airport gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because their employees are terrific
the fields are also an issue
all that was missing was a rubber duckie
a no hassle tour of some vegas clubs loved it
i too understand that there needs to be time to set up for a new round but perhaps they could fix this
add to that video games and laser tag and you have yourself a winner
everything at bellagios buffet is exceptionally fresh nicely cooked and delicious
next was entering the room ahhhh lol yes the light was shining from above lol not really but thats the noise i made when my friend and i entered the room
overall i would stay at harrahs again but again im not nearly as picky about rooms as other people since i use it to shower and sleep
i got the chicken burrito and it was amazing
they never charged me since i didnt stay but if i were you you can find a comparable deal through smartervegas
we ordered the furikake poke prices vary based on fish market value loco moco with amazing gravy mud pie and lilikoi drink 050 refill
dont go if your expecting to sit down or have a fine culinary experience
the chicken salad pressed panini was delicious
an added bonus was attached to the hotel was a flower shop and a 7eleven convenience store
it was my lucky day i can say
looking forward to this show and we got here before 8pm
great martinis on happy hour
here is an example about a month ago the hub  i went to ab for lunch
i would not stay here again
you feel like you are in the vegas of sinatra or at least swingers or the hangover
i have never experienced that ever at any restaurant in my entire life
its such a big place that this is common
the beer is tasty the building is beautiful the service isnt bad
the room was clean in fact they had just finished shampooing the carpets
i ate at the buffet
they were served room temperature and were overly seasoned w spices and salt
overall loved the concept service and especially cookies
it came with rice and beans and some sweet yams which were also great
i dont think ill stay here again i rather stay somewhere where they stick to good service themed hotel and a lot more bang for my buck
best place ever took my mom and best friend there
other than that a very nice romantic and satisfying dinner
we fell in love with our room and customer service and of course the pool
very sad to say the least
a case of lemons in these hotels cost around 25 for approx 200 lemons
despite it being a holiday weekend i could still find tables at mgm going down to 10 even at night
i had a private sunset trail ride with roger
this isnt a cheap place  i had the pretzel bread the mussels and the margarita and it cost me 30 before tip
i wont check out for another hour or so but i had to get on yelp to share my love and praise for theballantyne hotel and lodge
the marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it
take my word do not stay here by the way there were others in my group thag stayed at this hotel  it was my daughters 21st birthday and we rolled into this dumb after waiting in a long line to check in
i found that to be an unbeatable deal considering i picked one of the more expensive flowers the difficulty in the arrangements and the quality of service
she was excellent
it did not look like the pictures on the website
the table reservation line was the longest one
it is owned by the mgm grand corporation
i figured id have a bite and that would be that
the staff was outstanding so helpful and friendly
very plain bedding
the bars are nice mint lounge in particular and the bartenders are very welcoming and professional
i took my family on a saturday night around 9pm
the shower is ice cold and looks like a shower from the brady bunch they dont even have a comforter on the beds its an extra sheet
das valle liegt mitten in der innenstadt von stuttgart  wahrlich nicht in der besten lage was die aussicht betrifft hssliche unihochhuser parkhaus gegenber  aber super zu erreichen egal ob mit dem auto oder den ffentlichen verkehrsmitteln
the walkways throughout the casino floor and main drag in the hotel are quite narrow
i wish it was more spread out and not so crammed together
apparently a very common switch is to say the main tower if full so they send you to the upgraded west wing
they didnt care they charged me for these things anyway
today was my second visit
great place to stay
their hot sandwiches are perfect anytime of the day
31st floor rm 125  i paid for a delux room high floor strip view  this room had a view of the luxor and mandalay bay
the actual salad bar toppings are different than i was thinking
i really liked this timeshare
the rooms were great and we would definitely consider it next time we are in town
we had a glass of champagne for each person at the table and the banquet servers cleared them off before any of us could have it
although the folks who fill wander and shop the streets of dcranch are seemingly wealthy white conservative folks a sort of small town folksiness seeped in and made me happy
the room was in great condition spacious with an amazing view of the strip
was looking forward to a shower  sleeping
we found the sahara westwood and pics of the freaking sahara hotel camel icon on this site
you   the front desk addressed         had to listen to the whole thing  me by name over the duration     before you could delete it
now ive been to this qdoba twice and this was the second time that she tore it
in regards to play and customer service we were unsure a lot
the samosa chaat is by far the tastiest thing on the menu and best value can easily feed 2 as a meal
not a gambler so i had time to sit back and observe everything  everyone  down in the casino
i love the chicken and the turkey as well
black more specifically did i mention the three tempature escalating shower i was introduced too
i felt the chicken was the highlight of the plate
the best thing about this place are the forum shops
dinning from starbucks and crepes to craft steak and latelier mgm has 20 eating establishments on its grounds
service was friendly but the timing was off
a must stop when youre in vegas or eating on a budget
i spent hundreds of dollars at the tables and never got offered one drink
tonight my husband and i thought we would treat the kids to ice cream
they are not allowed to do that
the hightech room system was not functioning  we werent able to open the blackout shades or operate anything electrical in the room so hotel management secured a move to the room next door
the bad they dont have a thali platter except for take out
it is a really lovely venue
this was my first visit to hob vegas
it was not crowded at all
i had a couple of bad experiences now with this place when it comes to customer service and caring about the community that supports them day in and day out
all he did was give a couple of excuses and talk about this awesome night club that was connected to the house of blues
i never observed anyone winning much at the slots which is unusual in vegas
we booked it through tripres and they threw in 2 free 24hr adult buffet at the rio or any of the 7 hotels
more magic water please
i cant say enough great things
super delicious food
we were given a 20 credit to use at the hotel
when parking is 430 minutes it was a complete waste of my money and time
wie gesagt man will viel kann aber nur wenig
first and foremost you have a lovely hotel with an excellent location
each day booked includes a nice complimentary breakfast buffet
i will say this though if you want to be stuck at the very south end of the strip in an ugly casio with idiots and thier illmannered kids have a crappy room and experience terrible customer service then by all means book at stay here
totally fine by me as he is after all a legend and oddly enough he was still kinda sexy haha
i loved the his and her sinks 2 tvs in the bathroom and that the toilet was in its own separate area
also the bell hop and valet people were friendly and courteous
half time it isnt done
my family had fun two nights vacation here
the trip consists of four major rapids and if there is enough flow a fifth rapid
maybe make an effort to write somewhere on the ticket that i cant utilize the venues full bar when seated at my pricey balcony seat
i got the mac n cheese and it had some type of cajun seasoning it tasted delicious
also i totally love the vibe here
if i were in gwam i feel like this is what a restaurant would look like
what more could you ask for
i wish he could have been more present
anyone parking on the north side of the building has to walk around the building to enter
ive never even had to endure the potential torture that is a room at this place but ive been in the casino and lobby enough to know that this place is a beacon of filth
i guess im just puzzled as i expected more attentive actions by mgmt
very nice resort with fantastic service and close to fun activities near scottsdale
the only reason that i did not give it one star is due to the patio
i was really looking forward to my meal
but the sweet potato gnocchis were way too buttery
rooms are pretty modern with some boutiquelike featuresloved the bathroom the most with floor to ceiling marble tiles and a tiled shower
not only did this sudden news make me upset but i was told to arrive 15min early for me to wait at the front desk for 10min to check in
we stayed on like 32floor or something like that good view
the hotels were clean but didnt have much
my family and i have loved dillys deli for years and it doesnt  disappoint
the hooters restaurant and bars in the hotel were clean and good service
my boyfriend and i celebrate special occasions bdays anniversary here because we just love the food and service
great service from the bartenders as well they know their stuff
i have friends who were with us that night that will not be coming back
i had an enjoyable time but after grabbing some food did a little gambling and then headed back
i go to a ton of indoor playgrounds and this is by far my favorite one in vegas
1 queen bed room at 85night theres a public outdoor parking lot next door it was 20night when i was there
well this was my experience once we got in about to head in the check in line we were bombarded by a film crew asking for us to star in a short scene i was eager to check in since it was a long hot drive so i said no but my friend said yes ill do it so that held us back a good 20 min
you can connect to free tram from tropicana to mandalay  bay and luxorthe mirage also has a free tram that runs the mono rail is not free but heads north out of mgm
a suite here should cost you one half to one third what the venetian is asking
1 atm fee cheapest i could find on the strip
i hate to complain but we experienced a few disappointing issues and i appreciate the opportunity to share
im not sure why management doesnt do something about these deficiencies
i am sorry
our server was very knowledgable about the menu especially the drink menu
i also loved the starbucks conveniently located in the hotel
huge bathroom two separate showers one with two shower heads only one potty
it is las vegas after all and im sure other people will fill their rooms
didnt realize there was no soap until i was in the shower
we checked in after being given many judgmental looks by all the people working behind the desk
if you like processed crap full of preservatives this is the place for you
ive never been much of a vegas person
ate the toast
after listening for like 5 minutes i finally decide that the noise is coming from the front door and that it was some prank by some kids
so this is how the better half lives
this is the classic riviera
i should have known better than to sign that waiver
finally went to check this place out since its been opened
the djs along with the photography was simply amazing i couldnt be more happy
i stayed in a king suite and it was a wonderful night
again opposite of many other hotels casinos that are dark and leaves that claustrophobic feeling with you unless you go outside
free internet for my wife and i is always a plus at a hampton
the location was perfect
trash bags pile up on the hotel hallways
after discussing this with them they emailed well your going to lose and hour right there but hey you seem like a pro at this stuff so we will pack up and leave at 8pm
the minigolf course is the same a little run down but still a fun course a variety of shots and obstacles
south point does an awesome job for their bingo extravaganza
if you want a little out of the way place to explore that looks like its from a different era youll have found what youre looking for here
unfortunately i had two nights in this hotel
the kitsch of this place is everywhere from the porthole shaped windows to the nets and seashells hanging up on the dining floor
it seems like all the noise is trapped on w harmon by the surrounding buildings
while it is a large establishment that can fit a large crowd there clearly wasnt a need for so many servers
my friends and i did the escape from mars room which was put so well together and super creative
we went for a birthday brunch on a saturday and was told that they only offered it on sunday even though the website didnt mention that
overall this is definitely one of my favorites when looking for a local hangout with a great atmosphere
our food favorites inside the mirage are the carnegie deli blt and stack
hence the 1 star deduction
and we paid less than 13 of the price
im definitely a fan of palms place
loved the entire experience including truly incredible customer service
all their equipments were clean
beware this place can be addictive
missed happy hour so we sat in the lounge at 615 for some appetizers
id give them zero stars if i could
thank you tony alida nikki  mom
always helpful and informative
the in laws invited themselves over but we didnt warn her ahead of time
if you think thats bad keep in mind that in hotels like the bellagio ive had to wait up to five hours for my room to be ready
so what is the point of having a gym
the toilette did not have a fan though bring your poopourri when you come here
she never asked me what my budget was or why i wanted to try it on
a little old school if you ask me
we sat on the very lovely patio
meanwhile my family six people sat waiting for 20 minutes
i was not impressed one bit
i will never stay at a wynn property ever again
those posts are from half a year ago though there must be a  new manager
there doesnt seem to be any hustle in these parkers
nice resort located in downtown chandler
at paris we feel like we are being treated betternot here
i knew to travel light since both i and my tiny purse were subject to inspection
yes its not super fancy like xs or tryst or marquee but it is fun and there are actual places where you can sit for a few minutes after youve been dancing your feel away
and what do ya know they dont do early checkins
sorry but you shouldnt have tin in your food ewww
the carrots served at dinner were uncooked
almost to the point where it was too much but i wont complain about the attention
was tired when we arrived so we relaxed in our room  ordered room service  which was delicious
the hotel is located right at the end of the strip across from mgm new york new york and excalibur
one side for trash and one side for recycling
for 28 it was definitely over priced
unlike the typical dingy smoky casino there is a painted sky above the floor
for 140 i should have stayed downtown
customer service is good but that should be a given in the hospitality industry
ae media production was a complete waste of money
the chicken wings go fast since they are the best in town and totally free every friday for happy hour
dont these losers know that the way to ensure happy repeat customers that will recommend you is to give your guests a positive experience
overall this place looks good but all the experiences were bad
bunch of druggies all over the dam place
the renovations of the hotel are simply gorgeous
bands play every weekend
pros  great heavenly bed  convenient one block location from subway street cars and downtown  underground direct concourse connection to eaton centre shopping  beautiful hotel with nice dark wood accented rooms cons  wifi and internet for 15day
they also decided i needed a security escort not sure why who walked me not only to the elevator but to the room
should have been delicious but had no taste
babycakes bakery is awesome
its her favorite place from living in florida
we came around midnight and there were pretty much only bar patrons
5 excellent selection of exotic fruits during periods
exactly what we were looking fori dont think theres any other option locally
i usually aim to stay at the properties that are newer because the older ones generally just have a dated kind of feel to them
the midway was wonderful even for our 2yearold
i did happen to notice that it was all booths and smaller tables so i wonder how they would be accommodating larger groups
i have them replace the tomatoes with the sun dried and it is even better
relaxing after my trancontinenal arrival  debating if i shall take my shower before i consume that mid day presentation offering
every single staff member was kind and helpful
all of our guest loved the food and one person said it was the best bbq they had ever tasted
we came here for new years eve week and i had booked the room 6 months prior asking for the same type of room i had two years prior which is the one bed room well when we arrive we got a studio my mouth hit the floor  it barley held my daughters luggage
otherwise a very nice hotel and resort to stay at the pool is beautiful and they have some good restaurants
we were given a fifthfloor room which was fine but may have been an issue if we had brought our dogs which we ended up not doing
so beware if its too good to be true then it is
oh yeah and the poolbest in vegas
we were lucky enough to get a strip view on the 12th floor
also tough to sleep with the air conditioners running outside that particular side of the hotel
no working ice machines
we walked right past it did a half circle and walked right past the street we were supposed to turn on and had to turn back they renamed the street and google maps hadnt updated
already said a diamond
i have stayed in over 50 different resorts
that being said to outoftowners expect the unexpected from madisonits very nonwisconsin from my experience
just be careful they serve rolls with every meal
thankfully the second one did
it makes it hard to enjoy the bbq which is quite tasty when you see how dirty the surroundings are
love the hotels atmosphere
doesnt look like much from outside but this place is worth the stop in
we came for lunch and i got the turkey and brie sandwich with a side salad and it was excellent
it was just about perfect
they sent a bellhop over to help us with our bags and assigned us a new room in the main tower an upgraded room with a full view of the infamous lake
rooms are quiet
very nice gym for a hotel much less a historic one  great hotel stay if you get the chance
kept getting danced into by some other people
red devil on 32nd street and mcdowell is my favorite restaurant of all time
called three times for extra sheets and pillows and waited over an hour and a half just to get sheets
yeah that didnt happen
as i remember the gordo burrito version at the old location was huge and packed with cheeses queso meats and all the other mexican fillings youd expect in a monster burrito
like i said friendly and accommodating staff but be warned about bed bugs and other pests
daniel at the front desk hooked me up and with a discounted rate
the staff was great it was clean
well be staying somewhere else when we go back in a few months
thats no taco they even tasted bland
i recommend the brussels sprouts or green beans over the asparagus it was just a little too thick and soft for me
we stayed here when we saw underworld perform nearby
2 stars  i would not recommend this establishment to friends or family
its nice to see some positive things happening in the downtown area and were happily looking forward to future visits to the barbistro
i am just disappointed in the customer service
we were also on the same floor with the pool and the breakfast cafe
the staff is super friendly and helpful bit that is all this hotel has going for it
the bathroom is spacious and somewhat remodeled  although the shower is tiny and the tub is 13 the depth of a normal hotel tub
the bathroom was amazing and spacious too
i am assuming the grouchy old cabana man complained to his waiter that we were trying to sit in chairs meant for cabanans only and because we are in our 20s and he is in his 60s we are in the wrong
theres a path for a nearby morning run along tempe town lake if you need to burn off the animal style from the night before or you can hit up the workout center before you set about the day
where do you start
from having to wait in line over 30 minutes to checkin at midnight and one person in line in front of us to pubic hair on the toilet seat and other hair all over bathroom
and the bread
service  is always on point with towelspillowsother necessities delivered in a timely matter
now that theres a casino nearby though parking at those lots may have been increased
i could smell smoke billowing through the hotel and rooms at least in other hotels you feel the air ventalating with a hint of smoke
ive never ate at geordies but ive heard its good
all in all great  bbq place
got a cab and off we went
exact same room beside mine at same price and who checked in at the same time had a fridge already in the room
the food says enough
i told roslyn that this was completely unacceptable
2 we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and requested the rooms be near each other if not right next to each other
even though we showed up late fawnia was so enthusiastic and lovely and even stayed late to complete the class
so lunch ended up being cheaper than happy hour
think of a grownup fresher delicious version of a double decker taco from taco bell
well this seems really poor customer service to me
theres even a big room for bingo
there is no way you can compare los frijoles to robertos it is right around the the corner from my house so my husband and i went there for the opening and we loved it
and the pool is small and overcrowded
as a new business we are sure there are some kinks to be worked out but over all we were very pleased and will definitely be back
in the future i will be reserving this room when i make my reservations
they have a good court too with different mostly mexican food choices
tuna the manager was great she solved a minor problem quickly and followed up to make sure everything was resolved
i called the front desk to let them know what was going on but no exageration was on hold for 15 minutes before an a front desk staff was available
by the wayits open 24 hours
not too big of a deal since the weather is always gorgeous
this place makes high quality healthy food for breakfast lunch and dinner
i do have a couple of knocks against the place but nothing major
we booked through priceline and got a great rate
the reception area is modest and the staff were great and gave us mini toy puzzles to solve while waiting for our whole group to arrive
service was great from valet to the hotel employees
but if you can snag a deal at the hard rock go for it
we drove late from cali arrived after 11pm and i get to the front door to checkin and i find the front door lockedwtf
the restaurant is located at planet hollywood hotel and is open 24 hours
located close to my favourite store simons thats just bonus
both of which are important to me
i had a great time the venue has no bad seats in them and just be prepared to be on the edge of your seat laughing the whole night long
sorry but the transition was a fail    i miss my go to place
internet access was free and there was a desk in the room
frhstck gibt es sicherlich bessere aber es ist der standard von best western
we we told no and we would have to wait for bell hop or carry on own luggage down ourselves to avoid being charged a 300 additional night fee
the flavors and the journey the restaurant owner took us on was simply great
food was fine
without coupons i could not afford this place
best friends go to hotel
we had a group of 12 first off our server did not write down our orders came back and asked two times and finally the third time he wrote our orders down
when another 17 days passed i sent her another email asking her about the status of the refund which she responded to a few days later saying that it totally slipped my mind and that she dropped it in the mail yesterday
delano is conveniently located adjacent to the much larger mandalay bay but i appreciate how quiet and classy it is compared to its sister hotel
they want us to do a small rehearsal
here are a couple of extra highlight during my stay
get a rental stay downtown and visit the strip at your leisure using the valet service to save yourself from from all the walking
both were very good
no small talk welcome to vegas etc
i wanted to make sure also that we didnt get charged for any extra bite marks left from other pets so any i discovered i let them know as soon as we explored the room
not healthy not fresh and not impressed
this honestly was one of my worst experiences
none of the restaurants really seemed to stand out and after walking past the tables it did not seem lively at all
absolutely the best place ive ever had plate lunch
my husband and i cant wait for him to cater our next occasion again and again
was just passing through and this place had a decent rate and was right off i85 in nc
try a pickled bar
3 heaterac was making so much noise sounded like a helicopter video posted but the staff didnt care about that either
crispy hot nice salt flavors the fish  chips were well received
the brunch buffet on a sunday was about 26
food reviews from those in attendance were glowing
there is no excuse to treat your customers so poorly since there are way too many other nice hotels to stay at in vegas
this hotel was reasonably priced and had a nice clean look
if you like being crammed in to dance then this is a great place
now for the good as stated previously the hotel is gorgeous and my room was quite spacious with a huge bathroom complete with a ginormous jacuzzi tub tv to watch as you lounge in said jacuzzi double sinks large glass enclosed shower and the toilet in a huge separate closet
a few days after checking out i found a nice 100 charge on my credit card  because this hotel likes tobait  switchits customers
allegedly a mom and her baby died in my roombut i didnt experience any paranormal activity
i was just at your restaurant getting that famous 2 for 1 deal and after we ordered ate and got ready to pay they told us that we needed a coupon
good food awesome design in and outside and cool environment
i come to the hotel room after celebrating my birthday party at omina night club
i love that she doesnt over retouch the photos so you still look like you
i love the music they play here
my friends went here
it was as if they fried it then nuked it in the microwave due to sitting too long
the man at the front desk when we checked in was very friendly and helpful
there is restaurantcafe service during certain hours
this is also walking distance to a lot of restaurants if you want to go out to dinner
very poor service because someone had to know the room wasnt cleaned
staying tonight as well because i have to but i will certainly never be back to this place nor will i ever recommend it to anyone
upon walking in i was really underwhelmed the dining area is about as small as a living room with no decoration on the walls
my wife had the vegetable plate and thought it was passable but nothing to write home about
very good waitress
they gave a large coupon book on arrival but found out later they could not be used unless we had a membership card from the casinohotel
mind you this residence inn is adjacent to the mayo clinic and desert land
the production was seamless and he was very helpful in putting me at ease during the process
weve been staying at this hotel for about one year now and we love it
the rooms are nice one of the best deals in vegas
20 min later i get towels
we had a two night reservation for my husbands work conference
the first time i stayed at most standard room rooms were average what stood out are the bathrooms
indeed i did
easy hot dog opportunity for certain
the only bad note for this visit was the soft serve ice cream
i had an out of this world everything bagel and an americano which was among the best ive ever had
it was nice to have easy access to the compass restaurant on top but the service up there when we tried to get drinks after the conference sessions was very slowreluctant
she didnt even say it in a polite manner either
i dream of eating them again
we always eat here while in lv
i got to see bellagio all the way to almost fremont st the carpeting had a few stains here and there and when you get off the elevator theres a sign that shows ice on that floor but that was nowhere to be found
the ice machine on our floor didnt work so it was an elevator trip up to the next floor
in order to make up for it the manager promised an extra bottle of shitty vodka
finally a super nice touch is being able to see into the kitchen from the front deck
go lower he whispers 200
overall for vegas treasure island is way below the standards
would probably opt out on the foodthey are a bit off if you have eaten at any of there other locations
food menu has many options to choose from
i very much enjoyed my stay here
the seating was great
went to the titanic exhibit which i enjoyed but the building itself is pretty nasty on the inside
the guy who checked in me in was a stressed out jerk but besides that i had a great stay  i really hate it when the desk people arent nice to you it just sets the tone
i arrived at night having just traveled for almost 10 hours across country with flight delays
as soon as you enter your hotel room for the first time the room literally turns on
if you are a deep sleeper than forget hearing the alarm
the entire experience overall was great  were considering hosting our next birthday party here for our 3 year old
beautiful fun happening clean and a cute spa
she saw that my husband ditched me at the hotel for 7 hours for work and so she kept checking in on me
everything went soo smoothly  we couldnt ask for better service
called back as suggested and now i am being told that they do not offer weekly rates
waited in the bar while waiting for our table for three
we didnt eat at any of the restaurants here and it was too cold to use the pool
free drinks  good music and very pleasant staff
omg    i  enjoyed myself
ive never reviewed a wedding venue before so just know i was quite motivated to give this place props
price was excellent and really loved the atmosphere
great value for the  and we will stay here again
this time i asked if it had been brewed already
note that you must go through the parking lot entrance to get to the entrance to the spa i walked around the building for a while trying to figure out how to get in worried that it was closed
my mother was very pleased  and thats saying a lot
elevators were also slow with the volume of guests attempting to utilize
they said maybe an allergic reaction and maybe the people before me snuck in a cat
close to airport too
now for the dessert
the also makes it easy to go to a multitude of different restaurants around the city
the birds the birds are everywhere  but not like in a hitchcock movie  just like in a safe beautiful kind of way
another thing i found that i thought was pretty darn useful was the free sunblock stations throughout the park and man am i glad i did find them because i had forgotten to put any on
we wanted to check in early that morning but they said the rooms would not be ready until the normal check in of 3pm
if youre a seasoned traveler the view of the golf course is most relaxing vs the strip view
we went back to the desk and was given another room on a higher floor with a 50 restaurant comp
i loved the layout of the meeting rooms
i enjoy my daily morning workouts before starting my day so i paid to workout at their fitness center
check in took a mere 5 minutes because we were smart enough to check in on a thursday afternoon
stayed here for a few days before our house was ready to move in
there are also ways to get out after five daysbut they are more complex
i was interest to check out the remodel which was ok but they need to remodel the experience in my opinion
i opt for savory dishes and have had the chicken fried chicken crispy and good the original egg sandwich very messy filling and good and the le pig sandwich actually lighter than the egg sandwich and also quite tasty
i ordered a medium filet mignon and it was tender enough to cut with a fork even though it was cooked medium
i cant speak highly enough of this guy and the character that he brings to his work
great service too
im inneren wird das bild von einem grossen tresen beherrscht sonst wie beim italiener gewohnt weisse tischdecken kerzen stoffservietten etc
the inside of the resort had a ton of nice restaurants bars and shows
very relaxing casino setup with the high ceilings painted blue sky and clouds makes ya feel that much closer to floating away after a few drinks
were from california with lots if great places to eat but this was top of the line all the way
highly recommend and the location is great to many things in the avon and surrounding areas
i tried several times to connect to the free internet and had no luck
always good service no matter how busy
however there is nothing distinguishing the menu from similar spots around town
downstairs they have toilets sorry ladies yours is 2 floor down and breakout rooms for conferences plus access to a secluded garden area out back
it is definitely worth going to
also i am just not a fan of letting my lungs be filled w smoke that could possibly one day kill me a little extreme i know but just trying to make a point and yes i realize vega is not a smoke free place
i finished saying welcome for him and we left an hour later
i stopped in friday for their 2 taco daily special with chips queso and a drink
they are melt in your mouth delicious
internal casino signage for the rooms demands improvement
truly so good
it is simply a bowl of mussels with a very flavorful whitewinesaffron sauce and a batch of really good french fries
nonsmoking rooms but offer a very nice designated smoking area
its a nice open club that has multiple bars open to avoid long lines
some of the other guests did seem a bit sketchy
and they have us plain wings
3 my bouquet was missing all of the rhinestones that were supposed to be attached
room to move
be on the look out for half priced tix or other deals if you want to save some money to lose at the tables instead
the venue was very different for each
i just called from the room and left the keys inside
but come on throw me at least a pinch of salt
my husband and i got the 12 oz sirloin
super juicy  the meatball was plenty large
had the lolo pulled pork sides green beans baked beans and creamy slaw
the only thing that wasnt for me was the bbq chicken
self park is difficult to get to and when in the structure there are no directions on the walls on where to park what direction checkin is etc
as an rci member for over 15 years this resort has very few amenities that make it worthwhile
nathan was a great mc and the evening flowed seamlessly
would not recommend it
the tv had tons of channels
the green lantern was right up the hill
my boyfriend ordered the california burrito
it took her 10 minutes to come back
very cool man
i dont know what more they could do other than buy the whole block
i used to play racing video games all the time as a kid and it was so much fun to claim that i actually learned something from them
we had to go to the yard house for the good beer which was just a walk away
as for maid service we did not get a room maid up
ok not their fault
it was a groupon
by the wayms willie needs to do some commercials for drury inn champaign
loved the fruit and presentation and again not overly sweet just right
also i have the biggest crush on him
i felt deceived because the pictures online are nothing compared to the real thing
clean but kind of dated 2
youll save yourself some
great center strip location
yeah maybe some of the decor is flashy and colors clash but it must be hard to dictate colors and patterns to him
maybe theyre just slacking on training who knows but it was an unfortunate start to our stay
nope never heard of it before
i do enjoy the location in wilmington a little more
we were approached by another couple in the lobby who had the same experience a well
it is worth it and amazing
thats an amazing deal
she just kept talking over me and continuing to be rude to me
they fielded our calls 247 set my reservations called maintenance etc
no joke im getting some intense cravings for their food as i write this review
though ive experienced better  i still think theres potential for  this wannabetryintobeboutique but itll take a while to get there
the last couple of times we have ordered from you guys it hasnt been up to your old standards
mom it sounds worst than it is
housekeeping did a good job whenever we asked for room service
its not sophisticated or deep or anything like that but its just simple fun
we werent the only ones waiting around and frustrated
seems easy for planet hollywood to have a tv channel playing the music of the fountains
as soon as we got in around 10pm on a thursday we went straight to registration and mitchell helped us out
if not they will sell you an overpriced pair if you need them
to be specific the kids all gave their drink orders to the waitress not the adults and the waitress handed the drinks to the kids
i see 100 kids and very small number of parents
best feature would have to be the monorailits inside the hotel next to the oasis club and is very convenient for getting to the strip
we were told the manager would call us the next business day
the atrium was extremely humid so ladiesget prepared for a facial
once we changed rooms the lady that was on the room next to ours was talking and screaming by herself burping making strange noises and with loud music through all the night and when whe left at 7am she was still up
last year i stayed here for a conference  and i loved it
lets put it his way its not a place youd want to walk in without some shoes
my only complaint is its pricey
didnt taste the garlic and there wasnt much balsamic on it
room and resort fee rip
the bathroom kits and bath salt are all exclusively made with relaxing essence oils they smell so good  make you all happy for no reason
then with the coupon book we received a whole bunch of match plays
delicious fish tacos
one thing that sucksits downstairs
i dont even understand how this place has good ratings
i was beat after a long drive and wasnt up for  a battle
when all was said and done i realized that id consumed passable italian food at quite a premium price with poor service to go with it
i have no complaints on the room
visited the facility and it was depressing
also have tvs so you can watch sporting events while there
then lets get to the staff
its not the bellagio or the ritz carlton it ranks on the same level as all other 3 star hotels
i requested another room and was told i would have to come and get the key myself and no one would be able to move my stuff
i had an opportunity to stay at this fine establishment this week and i was very impressed considering this is a holiday inn
i wouldnt know how much it costs per night because i got a package deal with southwest airlines but im sure it is in the 100s
i would not pay that knowing what i now know
he didnt ask for my id
i shop at this location typically three times a month as it is not the closest to my residence but it does offer produce the location closest to my house sadly does not
bellagio pool staff embarrassed a physically and learning disabled woman i stayed at the bellagio 810 may 2015 with 2 friends one of whom is a 32 year old woman who is both physically more than 50 deaf and learning disabled low iq
they arrived ahead of schedule they were absolulety breath taking and so fresh
we were not given any utensils plates or even ketchup and there was no server around to ask so i literally had to get up myself and take these things from another table
you get 10 discount with aaa
it was suck
overall a great dinner which i look forward to reprising
it is bright and cheery inside
qdoba on your on risk
its an old building and im guessing there is only so much they can do with it
i settled on the pear and we ordered food
the bathroom is nice
even the pizza crust was hard
the few times i had stayed in las vegas before even hearing of the platinum i stayed at some of the popular casino hotels and it irked me that there were no microwaves or coffee pots in the room
in the casino also pool and others
i asked if there was a roll to go with the salad and he said no but then said he could offer me a hawaiian roll
finally we are free of this eurotrash techno hell
no free wifi sucked for the kids too
well thats not true
avoid this overpriced trap at all costs
while i didnt expect a room to have a view of downtown pittsburgh i did appreciate the fact that this hotel is secluded within an industrial park at the bottom of a hill
it had a small lobby small pool and dining area
however i continue to go back for the great deals
i was already checked out of my previous room so this caused some stress
huge difference huh
the kindness does not stop there
now the bad things   the walls are extremely thin so you could hear every conversation every toilet flush every shower and every door being opened and closed
the room seemed half renovated
we eat out alot and are always looking for a good breakfast place
when we found out our room is on the 25th floor we were very excited
masquerade bar more of a dive bar feel even though though its inside a hotel weird i know
this was an unexpected find on our weekend away to montreal while walking along the port
oh and their selection of spices
i would not recommend this dealer to anyone
bread was very tasty
the inlaws upgraded and got a sweet room ours was small but no complaints
i show up at that time and the office is closed lights off closed sign on the door no signs of anyone
but for purposes of this exercise it could be any one of about 500 deserving performers seriously this is just silly
very tight video poker and slots
we said something to our waitress and they brought out new fullsized pancakes which was no big deal
its no longer glitzy like the new cosmopolitan gorgeous
so this place is close to me yet i had not tried it before until just this summer
the 4 queens doesnt have their own pool but the 1  binions is open for use all ya need is yur room key
there was a fantastic live salsa band playing but not many people on the dance floor
when i came here a couple years ago i had the best passion fruit mojito but the bartender said they couldnt make it this time wth
the floor to ceiling windows have great views
best on off days and hours
great for special occasions
all of the employees were very nice
do we recommend this casino
we chose well
we think we will be making the bar at jcs our new friday night hangout
i love taco trucks in arizona my favorite mexican restaurant in the world is a taco truck in tucson nenes but for fish tacos i will say that i have yet to come across one that i would take over rubios honestly
just be aware that it is in the south strip and you have a long walk or 10 min cab ride to places like cesars or venetian
you wont be disappointed
food though i only tried their canaps was excellent
mama beth bell
once again very unprofessional
i replied i dont think either of them are
we forgo the usual matzo balls which we find mushy and order the new kreplach soup
don was on point
the art is still accessible and nobody seems to mind if you take a quick snooze on the art
i didnt like their breakfast menu but their coffee was good
waited 1015 minutes
loved this hotel
great for the price and right in the middle of the strip
i go straight to their salad bar where you get to choose from 18 different types of salads ranging from healthy greens like kale and spinach to powerful veggies like broccoli and beets to carb fillers like penne quinoa couscousyou get the drift
the space is large very open and simple
ac great nice and coldthe continental breakfast could be better but its okall in all my stay was worth what i paid for
dont have a day club then deny service to girls in cover ups
now im off for a full glutanous and carnivourise day headed to black hoof
if you want a luxury getaway dont wait
when they finally got us out all they were concerned with was having us sign something saying we didnt need medical attention and they gave us some water the manager couldnt wait to walk away from me
also i never received my extra hh points as promised
ahh bonnie springs ranch
and they serve peroni which is important to me
on the plus side the upgraded room was cleaner but still worn down
so hanging at the pool by our room was out of the question
the kids loved running around and interacting with everyone
aloft is it
keep them in mind especially if you find yourself traveling north from canton like we did
i got stuck 3 times in the elevator in be one day i stayed at your hotel
yes the pretzel roll with provolone fondue is to die for
we were pleasantly surprised to find a best western that was this good
chicken is good
the room was terrible and we demanded a room change
our room had peeling wallpaper gunk stuck above the shower and hair from a previous stay on the floor
fun yummy and casual
overall it was not a pleasant experience
going to our room was really annoying
love this addition to the midtown area
with all the other places in old town as well as scottsdale i will not go back
then i get woken up as 7am to try and go to this meeting so we can get our free stuff no thank you
reservations went off without a hitch we called to let them know would be in around 10pm and they said no problem easy to check in valet parking friendly staff etc
no fan in the bathroom
was great for a late night snack you cant beet 6 bucks in vegas
lets hope that when i submit another review at the conclusion of our stay the hairs will have been removed and i can give the establishment more stars
the staff was friendly and helpful
we were there on a thursday evening and the ambience is yuppie cool
la chambre tait assez grande pour une chambre ordinaire et les couvertes en plume taient divines
upon arrival at 610pm we were told that we would not be seated because the management had changed their minds about seating times
while they had the usual choices of proteins their sides were oddly paired in just about every case
and im telling everyone in my path to stay far away as well
it was pretty dead during the midweek lunch but would be a good place to go with friends at night for a drink
the casino was so quiet
she was so fantastic and my boyfriend and i both had such an amazing experience with amber that we would be foolish to go anywhere else
this place is awesome
as i said nearly every hotel and resort charges these fees but its still robbery once you consider what they charge you for the room already
my 6yr old daughter especially loved the pool since she was able stand up in the shallow end
when people complain about the prices here im guessing they havent been to new york lately
my partner booked the room and said that this courtyard was similar to the one where he last stayed in austin tx  somewhat dated and just lacklustre even for a business property
the curtains were filthy dirty
i usually dont yelp about hotels but this one was cool
its byob so you can bring wine beer etc and snacks
our waiter was awesome very attentive and offered some great suggestions
just visited for the first time and i will say we will be returning very soon
this hotel is nothing but liars  crooks
decided to change up our date ideas and he planned a night of black light minigolf
dessert was wonderful
the only thing with the cupcake was i wish the alcohol was baked into the cupcake batter and not inserted into the middle of the cupcake
the beds were so comfortable we didnt want to leave then in the mornings
this place has a rewards program  that means im going back
tables are packed tight but not to hinder travel throughout the restaurant
it has all the table games and i won some money so i cant complain too much
we came here for my cousins graduation with a party of 12 we got a table right away as we reserved one
if i was to return to vegas i would stay here again
lots of stores and fast food all within 4 miles
this place is magnificent
why did they have me wait all day
the room was nice and very clean my only gripe about the room is the fact that they dont use do not disturb signs for the rooms so the cleaning crews will come and knock on the door to see if youre there
we ordered a pitcher of the house sangria which was plenty enough for the three of us drinking it
drinks are around 12
once i discovered that kiwanis was basically my down the road neighbor i have been going regularly
she tried to sugar coat it saying that the double bed room is more spacious lies
the manager on duty kept checking my fiances id to make sure it was actually him
hints were available to us when we needed
but then again its beef and barley
great food great service
he was friendly and energetic which made the experience enjoyable
the rooms have been remodeled and the shuttles were very helpful in getting us around to eat and drinks
the bathrooms were fully equipped
i will be back as this one is closer to where i live
she was fantastic
you truly want more but are left disappointed
my only only gripe is that there could be a little more variety of what they have to view but maybe that is limited by size of the facility
dont be conned
a little bit pricey but super fun gifts and decor
the circus games also look like they could be good fun for kids
it only costs 7 per person but the pottery you choose to paintdecorate is how they get you
the pool for all ages is right below which you can access by a walkway
the pool is huge and nicely landscapednothing fancy but for the price its great
i was planning an event with very little lead time and had to figure out the food  i was fortunate enough to find smoke it bbq
i was freaking amazed
not all of the lights worked and it just seemed mediocre
it would be good to bring younger kids there when the older kids are in school
lol she said its better than the oxtail from the california hotel because the oxtail was all meat as opposed to the cals fatty oxtail
this location always gives great customer service and has never messed up my order
we go 2 days a week for the family class and then on friday for sparring class
cirque de soleil o was a must see show
the staff was all very helpful and friendly and our room was amazing
sexy layout of open end shower and rest of bathroom
great first choice
the gym equipment is terrible
we paid for vip seats  that doesnt get you anything but 2 pieces of meat instead of one all you can eat isnt true
the beds were very small and god knows that dusts were coming out of the enormous ac
even the other guests were pleasant to be around
i have been to other locations and they were really good
it can be hard to put my platestray there when theres already others in the way
i mean its good that a place isnt packed but we thought it was odd that it was super quietghost town
service is quick and friendly
i was very pleased
the carpet and upholstered furniture is past the point of cleaning and needs to be replaced
worth going if you can
exceptional customer service is a way of business and get air gets kiddos for hiring such excellent staff
it was seriously off putting
with one of the largest dinosaur collections in the world you could literally spend an entire day in the history museum alone
i mentioned that i had already received a call saying the opposite and this new detective said he had no idea why the other person had called me
kudos to the security staff
originally i had given this review a 1star rating because they put us in a smoking room we clearly booked nonsmoking
but the restaurant closes really early
with the looping scarface and pulp fiction added in as well
anyways we used the conference rooms for the trek events and they were spacious and the rooms had their own outlets every few feet  to charge phones and cameras
we love the closeness of the parking elevators and just everything about the rooms and hotel
who would not want freshly baked bread at home
furniture was clean and not outdated
2  location its in a great spot right next to all of the linq stuff across from caesars and right in the middle of the strip
i just moved from california  i was looking for a new eyebrow lady
i stayed in the hollywood hip king room and supposedly it was 450sq ft but i did not feel like that at all
location easy to find and plenty of parking ambiance casual with picnic looking tables
this place is well hidden and really not talked about much
however the flashy acrobatics seemed to be drawnout after a whilefor example you can only go through a climb away from the bad guys chase or run around the rings scene for so long before it gets boring
she was able to capture our natural happiness even though we could be irritated at the first go around to seeing the photos she was able to take we both realized how amazing life is and how blessed we are
for that i fail you
they were courteous and called back to find out how our evenings went
or cheaper arcade games
a couple of them including the one at the front desk acted like we were annoying him by checking in
the guy closest to that end of the bar moves down a few seats very conspicuously uncomfortable sitting near the loudly arguing blobs of mexican heritage
the bootlegger is like what las vegas used to be  the good parts
they are fish
save your money go to new york new york thats were we stayed the whole time better restaurants friendly people better pay outs on slots
the front desk staff working here are generally rude except for isaac that no longer works there
the first time i gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking this is a rare occurence and went back
in a business park so completely safe yet 15 min from the downtown
im writing this review at 1130pm in a cosmopolitan room on the 52nd floor
at least they treat you better and if youre a player you dont have to ask them to comp your drink
it was very nice to get away from the casinos and enjoying some nature
i think in the future i shall go with the full experience and rent myself a benz buy a high class hooker and finally enjoy the luxury of the valet parking without the valet guys stare me down with disgust at my domestic brand automobile
weve had their breakfast lunch and dinner  all have been amazing
finally the shift manager from security comes and pulls me aside and speaks to me in much more respectful manor
too many other options out there  the hotel asked me to email them about my experience and they didnt even care to reply so off to the bellagio i go
we went here for breakfast before heading out to nascar
the bathrooms were huge and had a shower and jet tub bath tub
amazing service and extraordinary food
theyre all true
lowkey cool waitersresses good food reasonable prices
this just leads me to think a few things  the server was too lazy to make a pot of coffee if it was empty you have a rude bartender on your staff or better yet you just have 2 people that are in need of remedial training of providing customer serviceall over a dang small cup of mojoi ended up playing at the exact machine i pointed to and grabbed a cup of mojo at starbucks
taste is awesome
as others have mentioned the crust is where glass nickel kind of falls down
the pool area is very pretty but of course gets crowded on a sunny day
outstanding linens and high thread count sheets
comfortable stay and good customer service
very friendly atmosphere the cashier was a pleasant young man who made a few suggestions since i was a newbie in their restaurant and i must say that every suggestion tasted rather delicious i will definitely be back soon
the facility was clean and well maintained
nothing fancy but great home style cooking
besides that the actual store was very cute
dont like the guy on the phones briskness scare you hes just being efficient
if youre undecided about sls i say go for it
first the hotel remembers their frequent guests
not great bought a living social deal w friends after loving paint  party n it was nowhere near as good
additionally three elevators were out of service which resulted i the other three elevators consistently being really full
we got discounted tickets through tix4tonight and i didnt bother to buy the category 1 tickets
just be sure you know of the costs when you stay
its like trying to put lipstick on a pig
either pay the chapel for photos of your wedding ceremony or have none
come hungry because they will definitely fill you up
being from new york i did some research online
if you have been to maryland dont even try to compare the crab cakes
the rooms have always been nice
refrigerator and microwave and a keurig for an especially nice touch
nasty nasty grotesque vile smoking in the front of your building
i take my younglings here during their toddler time
all in all great experience and id stay here again
love love love it here
my biggest complaint is that i was promised a nonsmoking room there is no way in hell that my room hadnt been smoked in recently
one stayed in a building where the furnace broke on a freezing night
this was a little on the burned side
i would recommend staying clear of the parking structure and just parking in the adjacent lot which is meant for the convention center
we were in our room within 15 minutes of arriving
it is authentic mexican food and a must stop or return visit
3040 minutes off of the strip
the gnats flying around in a room should be a dead giveaway that you missed something
the gentleman who checked us in even obliged us some picturetaking so we could get in the shot with our friends
there is a little bar and patio area if you dont want a booth
i also wanted that free internet access and i used it
we ordered a bottle of wine but we were told it wasnt cold enough so they put it on ice
its right in the middle of the strip its nice its cheap and they even just renovated many of the rooms
i witnessed a manager fluffing the pillows in the lobby  the blue hound has great specialty drinks and the bartenders were extremely attentive
i did hear a lot of english accents
shuttle service soso
the biggest bonus to this place is that the electric karts dont stink and give off fumes like the gaspowered karts up the road at octane raceway
well we were in the area last night so we stopped in
it was a pleasure getting to know her
arrived early to checkin but of course they wanted an additional 20 to checkin early before 3pm the rio just let us on through no concerns to nickel and dime me
the chicken was the highly processed salty  chunks that are barely food
this place is great
plenty of free open parking on both sides of the property
by far my favorite hotel
they have decent bath soaps and shampoo
i would definitely stay here again
i think there names were eddie  emilio
im not a smoker
our waitress went and got the manager who told us since it was a misunderstanding and since we already ordered and paid for the food we would be allowed to bring it in
never mind the missing remote and menu there were short  curlys in the tub hair around the toilet the glass nightstand had residual food on it and the worst of all the back of our toilet had a ridge that was full of urine
burnt ends  omg it was very dry and really no flavor
sorry for not knowing what your menu items are exactly
she was really nice and we all joked about how we wanted to be friends with her and we should just ask her to sit down with us
as i walked down the stairs to check out of the spa i didnt even realize that my boo was sitting in the waiting roomlol
the room was decent however they do need to do maintenance to the entire building
i know i did
although rooms in the tower have received contemporary updates mine felt dated with its lackluster hardware dirty vents and walls and a high bathtub with a slippery floor
my lovely fianc and i stayed at the monte carlo recently for my birthday
unfortunately their checkin process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm but they did give them spa credits
i got a great deal on priceline and stayed there for two nights last week
favorite sides are the hush puppies and baked beans
thankfully there was a public garage around the corner with a pedestrian exit just a few steps from the hotel front door
it didnt seem any cheaper than some of the better places
they have whats called the breakfast club sandwich which consists of avocado bacon egg and cheese all on an english muffin
they had everything i didnt know i needed
well god bless this spot anyway because it truly is the spot that hawaiian natives come for a good time
it didnt work
a huge sandwich packed with a generous amount of meat and crispy skins
my sister had the spaghetti in meat sauce  large portions again
jodis passion and love for photography is only surpassed by her talent and eye for beauty in every image
we will be back here
it is a smaller place but within walking distance many great places
overall the room wasnt that clean for what we were paying
well that hold took a entire month to be refunded on my card i should i have remembered
just had the most incredible brunch at this locallyowned gem in scottsdale
so trendy in fact that i made a point to inform people that i was well aware i am not hip enough to be staying at the cosmopolitan
we booked a family vacation here for 4 days
2 of my guests ordered the angus burger with fresh mozzarella and crisp pancetta both said it was scrumptious
i was unimpressed with the game offerings with only two ping pong tables foosball and some corn hole
a client suggested this as a good place to meet for a business lunch and i couldnt agree more
das palmbeach ist eine bar neben dem mercedes benz stadion
i recently stayed 5 nights at ballys when i was in town with 30 coworkers for the himss conference
eight would be correct
the service was outstanding
for main i ordered dijon chicken with kale
you have to set aside a good amount of time to be able to get through this museum
the kid on the phone says they are so understaffed it is not his fault
they told me that the people in the room below complained
go in the daytime and go at nighttime to see the different perspective of toronto
sonoran studios assisted my company with our first tv spot
only negative is that it closers at 8pm
when you play the tables at the wynn you get great servicebetter than any other casino
overall its fun
they are more filling than you would expect
no gum in the convenience store
i dont know how people stay here
an oldie but goodie
thats why i stuck with the burger which was a great choice since it was huge the patty didnt even fit the bun since it was huge and the fries were really yummy
el personal muy atento y me reservaron unas excursin al gran can y dom hoover
its great to be recognized just by walking in
bathroom smelled like piss and the floor creaked upon walking on it
yes we paid 67 plus tip
the owner of impact djs is easy to work with honest and is extremely talented
the place feels very family friendly and is definitely a change of pace compared to hotels on the strip
simply the best hawaiian food in las vegas and henderson
upon entering our room my husband and i would completely in awe with the accommodations in the room
a lot of places go this route as i suppose its easier but to me special means homemade jam
we both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench
we were right in front rocking out to their old and new music
service was pretty good
either way check in was lacking in a big way
it was all very confusing to me and my girls
spent one night here during a drive across country and loved it
the furniture is damaged and beat up there is absolutely no maintenace of quality fine
updated finally got a chance to stay here for 3 nights in a suite
bartenders were friendly and competent
the girl that sat us took our drink order returned with our drinks and that was the end of any type of service
having now visited the renaissance westin and fairmont i would pick either the renaissance or fairmont for a return pittsburgh visit and additionally would steer our corp business to those properties
the lounges bars were cool too mist and tangerine
old school like a lot of people mention is cool in my book
i stayed at the aria for the weekend and wasnt quite sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews here
its also one of the quietest hotels i have ever stayed at  you cant hear anyone else from your room
this is one of my favorite hotels on the strip
this place would be great if it werent for the crappy guests cosmo is pretty and quirky but it tries too hard to be cool
my bouquet was absolutely perfect with tulips peonies roses babys breath etc
he told other diners about how the buffet was setup but neglected to tell us
got a corned beef sammich here for the first time in a while its still hand cut but thin enough so that its not blocky
the food they provided was very plentiful  crazy plentiful actually  but the quality on the first day sandwiches and rolls were boring and somewhat tasteless
it was the best part of our travels to vegas especially after our flight being delayed and having issues with renting a car
good service but halfway decent food
i got a really creepy vibe here
what can i say about emerald
i would highly recommend people find a different hotel to stay in unless you dont mind things like stated above
it was a small venue and she didnt seem to be busy but we seemed a neusciance to her
absolutely ridiculous and will not be using their parking service ever again
overall the food is nothing out of the ordinary but it tastes great and is relatively inexpensive compared to other places in the area
we actually ordered a side salad with chicken and it was huge
i wish i could transport the parador whenever i visit anywhere
not a busy line bu it got noisy three times as a few trains were cranking on their horns as the went by
it comes in a huge cup with brownie pieces 6 scoops of ice cream chocolate and caramel sauces and whipped cream
lorraine was the hostess and lisa was or server
i was really looking forward to spending nye in edinburgh and thought this hotel would round out a fun holiday
i lovedddd my chicken chipotle sandwich
when we got the the hotel and checked in we couldnt find a pool because apparently they dont have one even though we were told they did
also you get 500 of casino play from the code if you show them your monorail pass
talk about a great neighborhood bakeryrestaurant
the kitchen area comes straight off the ballroom and so waiting staff were able to come and go easily
blackjack and craps are good
we stopped into the arrogant butcher for happy hour before a diamondbacks game
overall the steaks were very bland and had very little taste
1am130am took about 30 minutes for us to checkin
agent told me this is listed in the terms and conditions  which it isnt  plus we were never told that by the people who sold us the weekend
got up to the floor and it wreaked of weed
thats fine and all but i wanted more energy and lets be honest eye candy
the look of the restaurant is ok and the service was meh
there is no difference in either parking methods
they tried coping medieval times and its just a big fail
they sat us by the windowgreat view of the strip lights at night
plain and simple i like getting what i want not choosing from among the things that they want me to have
a very nice hotel with great service
all you need to know is stk wicked spoon buffet holsteins secret pizza
you have to see it now  giant patio that over looks a ravine that gets lit up at night a double sided fire place a lake as the backdrop behind the head table  i couldnt have designed a better layout myself
nice sized rooms
plus it came with black olives and israeli pickles
so it isnt a proper tea
the best part was the tv in the mirror in bathroom
i had an overall great experience in this hotel
dont let the location keep you away the monorail makes it easy
i complained to management and was assigned a new go room
the main advantage to front seating is your ability to see the lovely stage makeup
one of the best hotels ive stayed in
do what i did  tag along to your rich younger brothers birthday bash at the wynn
there wasnt alot of energy nobody seemed to be having any fun i dont think anyone was winning anything in the casino
i had to stop betting on football because you would have done better flipping a coin or throwing darts at a sports magazine than how i was doing with my nfl stuff
the first thing that needs to be talked about is how great the portions are
but its frustrating when the room is sitting there cleaned and ready to go and they still charge you
the only downside was the cell phone service
we will be going back often damned the distance
there were 6 or 7 little guys in a tank that seems too small for that many
when we arrived at the room some front desk woman was sliding her key in the lock
here is a good tip for everybody i booked the place off priceline for mandalay bay cheapest room available  then i went to checkin and when i spoke with the front desk guy i sandwiched a 20 between my credit card and id and asked for a free upgrade
we sat in line forever just to try to get in to the self parking
a nice hotel recommended by some colleagues
best hotel i have ever stayed in
it was quiet and dimly lit and the walls were covered with some pretty beat photographs overall the environment was cozy
ill start with that
the play area is open and there are not many areas where you cant see from any of the seating areas
in addition our beers arrived extremely large at least 750cc to 1l
i ordered the melon
recommendation from an acquaintance
wifi was pretty slow
i love the feel of this casino
i was forced to work with her assistant who had absolutely no knowledge of my event
when i get back to my room early sunday morning i call the front desk to make sure they arent morons and booked me through monday morning as all i ever was told was i was booked for the weekend
no food or drinks
3 both bathrooms are connected to their own bedroom but in one of the rooms there is no door between the bathroom and the bedroom
the current place is rather small
valet service is also offered
the resort fee was for what
i believe it has provolone cheese in it and it really puts it above every other mac  cheese ive had
they also helped us to confirm our cabana rental a must before 1030 or they will give it to someone else
totally worth it
this stadium is aok
the hotel rooms were pretty poor
we were in the room for 15 minutes when we saw a cockroach on the bed
the event ran pretty smoothly it sucks to have disney long waits at most events
i ordered a vegetarian tostada crispy steak taco and nachos
the front desk attendant was nice and all but i would have hoped for reimbursement of the points used for purchase or something
space storage bedding etc
anne and doug were absolutely an additional highlight to our day
location is awesome center to everything and free parking i see many casinos now charge parking which is just greed do they give odds on that
the sandwich was ok and it couldve been easily shared with another person
after this odd experience i would never choose to stay at the venetian again
highlights of these sandwiches the bread
spent 21 dollars for two pulled pork sandwiches two drinks and four sides
theres also plenty of sitting room area and cabanas to purchase as well not sure how much those were though
you must wait until 100 pm to checkin unless you willing to pay 3000 early bird checkin
if the hotel does not live up to expectations it must be downgraded just a little bit further
i actually didnt explore too much and stuck mainly to the dinning room
i will not be staying here again
there is not much privacy
having an inhouse starbucks was a good alternative and nice surprise
pictures and reviews can only do so much youve got to experience it first hand
we had a reservation for the kidnapped room at 530p
be careful when you book  partly renovated rooms  there is a big difference between pre and postrenovation rooms
i was so excited i could get real ny pizza in vegas
personally i like the music they play and think its fun to skate to
the outside area where the rides are were fine
room service is from the claim jumper and i thought the food was pretty good
the bathroom had water all over the floor and the wall were thin
both of which came out with just a tiny bit of warmth certainly not hot
so much delight
that being said there is a wonderful selection of decadent treats for those willing to try something new
one oldertomiddle aged female dealer witn short hair was so rude
since it is a farm to table restaurant the menu changes often
if you get a players card you get a great deal at the buffet
helpful staff business center severely needs update but staff was able to accommodate my needs
they forgot my taco and just seemed very disjointed
my room was perfect
always came back to clean rooms beds made  always fresh towels
besides the price increase resort fee and discontinuation of the summer special the downsides would be the unfriendly bartenders and front desk staff lack of a refrigerator in the rooms limited tv channels and we wish the pool would be open a bit later
this waiter mustve been half asleep or high on something
i really enjoyed the noodles thickness and texture
in the terrace suite our room had a full kitchen dining room living room two bathrooms and a large bedroom
1 very far from the strip
its been almost a week checked my credit card statement and my resort fees have not been refunded yet
our check arrived with 2 small black bags
my mom emailed a few times to ask about other upcoming months because we did not have any interest in the other two may paintings and did not receive a single response
after she spoke with jennifer for a while she comes back to me and says that jennifer said the extra charge will drop off
the gelato itself is amazing super silky light and refreshing not too sweet diabetic friendly and incredible tasting
the suite was very spacious and clean
nice variety and good wines too
first time here and im in love with this place
it has more quality diverse dining than anywhere else in las vegas
it can get noisy at times especially when young kids are in large quantity
id like to go again and maybe sit at the bar
overall it was okay
the queso i had was pretty tasty and it was served with fresh tortillas
we were treated like absolute garbage
a fair amount of water can also make it dicey but overall this course is impeccably maintained long enough to challenge even the lowest of handicaps and fair enough to permit an advanced beginner like myself a very enjoyable round
we had a good experiencewe stayed here for 5 days
and some other things that we didnt use
the bathroom had a huge shower with a large mirror
they have these delicious souvenir drinks that come in huge plastic eiffel towers or in this porcelain china whatever handmade balloon
leave your least favorite friend in line and go shoot craps
i would definitely stay at this hotel again but will call for blankets ahead of time
debris on the veranda falling off of the building next door
30 and you get what chef boyardee would consider a bad meal
this is a hotel
nothing blew my socks off
the food here is fantastic
they have a nice clean bowling alley and after midnight on the weekdays you can play for 1 a game without the shoe rental
we ate at their cafe since it was super convenient
of course eventually the closer came and again we said no by this time im fuming
eclectic is a good word
like i said the room was ok so we took a nap and when we woke up we decided to see how their casino was
by this time everyone around is standing around at a good distance just watching him play sigh soo close yet soo far from a celebrity
there were multiple dance recitals going on over the weekend that i was there so that was entertainingexcept when there was no where to sit or you couldnt get a beverage at the coffee shop for the crowds
no competing party rooms no massive crowds of the general publicif youve made the kids party circuit you know what im talking about
in the lounge we were rush ordering drinks
also he refilled my lemonade too lateafter i had paid and was ready to leave
room service was great
i can only say what everybody else has said about this place its amazing
the concierge chelsea helped us get show ticket and was such a nice woman
no ones ever opened an elevator for me until i stayed here
an hour wasted and we are hungry
they say they make the same wings as the restaurant but they dont taste like them at all
as soon as you arrive to this beautiful hotel you feel like youre in a different world
but southside works has amc in addition to other channels louisville did not
but then again the room didnt cost us all that much compared to other strip less than 5 hotels
from missing buttons in the elevator no hot water in the shower and toilet not flushing
every other hotel ive been in over the past few years has had inroom safes  not here
i wanted to plan a meeting with an ashley manor coordinator this weekend so here are all the times ive tried to contact them and have not heard anything back
there is a huge pane glass window that doesnt open
add this to my rotation if i was in the area more
the tobasco sauce and vinegar from the oyster dish sat the table for the entire dinner now we saw some reviews saying they have changed new management that answered everything
just make sure you dont bring important items and stick together to your group of people otherwise youre screwed
cant wait to see them all
there is too much to write about but i hope you get the idea  if you want to pamper yourself  relax and get treated like royalty for a few days  pick the sanctuary
i love it here
there is something for everyone
the lattes were yummy and the staff were very friendly and helpful
if you book through southwest airlines they even give you a resort credit mine was 7500 and it paid off really nice at the mgm buffet
we will definitely return here and highly recommend this location for breakfast brunch or lunch
our server silvia was so friendly and nice and took care of us so well
friends and i used to come here relatively often for volleyball trivia or an evening of bowling and our experience was always a mixed bag
the order was complete and as i awaited to be tended to what looked to be a manager approached another register and called for the customers behind me to serve them
after waiting longer our friend pulled rank and got us a room not only on the same floor but next door  it had been vacant the whole time
check my photos for a size comparison
anyway placed an order at the indoor bar for a shimmy drink and a beer
we used the beautiful large canopy for our ceremony area and then a smaller one for a picture backdrop
even the chips and salsa are worthy of mention
when the housekeeper and i were curious about the door a security guard helped me open the door and advised me the door was locked by the system and only his card was workable
we kept meaning to tell someone at the front desk about these things but every time we stopped by there was such a long line to talk to anyone that we took off
however knowing that it would be busy you would think they would staff the other venues in the hotel appropriately especially the pool
however this combo is not something i would ever choose if i have the option for other veggie varieties
so if you visit expect the food in general to be decent and the fish tacos to be excellent
most valet ive encountered hop on over to you flag or wave you over closer etc
go tipsy and have drinks after
after the second night of freezing i called customer care and they apologize for the inconvenience and that they were sending someone to look at it
one of the guys who worked there decided to share with me some stories about this
luckily we were able to make payments because i was not prepared for the amount they charge us
their lunch specials rock unless you can do better elsewhere for six bucks
all the rooms here are little 2rm suites and super cute
the room was located on the 14th floor but not part of the well being rooms
i just wished that the frosting colors varied a little bit more like on sccs websiteblog
the chairs were uncomfortable which surprised me
also the showers are super short
i had a caesar salad which was unfortunately so horrible i had trouble getting beyond a few forks
we come to vegas every year
my family and i stayed here about a month ago
check out my photo sphere photo of the place here httpsgooglhq2ikl
in contrast to most other vegas hotels this hotel does not have any shows entertainment or nightlife in the hotel
got our stamps and walked right in like bosses
luckily i gave them my google voice number
each time its just not good food
because we were staying at the hotel we got into the club
another important point is that a bubble wrap would mean the material should be enclosed or surrounding an object
we were out of the room for the entire second day
all of the restaurants a the hotel that we ate at were great see other reviews
they absolutely loved them
if you get the 2 bedroom villa your in luck
so when we went to the appointment at shutterbooth she was all against it and when we pulled up to this little office i saw her nose all up in the air
overall a great experience and we would return
its not a place we can go to often because it is a bit pricy but it is defiently a place we will go to when we have a little extra cash and are in need of some family time
people make mistakeswe forget
since i was there about 12 hours i didnt really get to enjoy it but that would be cool for a longer stay
they gave us a tower room because i told them my husband was allergic to smoke
at first i thought it was to good to be true but this definitely wasnt the case
free breakfast every day and dinnercapable hors doeuvres monday through thursday nights and beer and wine
this hotel is so lovely from the moment you enter the lobby
but our waiter didnt come back to take our order
food was just the worst ive ever had not to mention the price
the rooms and elevator were clean and there were earplugs on the night stand probably because this hotel is close to the airport although i dont remember hearing the airplanes
its close to my house so i stop by all the time
our housekeeping staff didnt speak english as wellmaking it hard to tell them what we neededi finally gave up and had to walk away
i got my food nice and toasty and enjoyed it there
would love to come back anytime
it is comfortable and pretty classy
it was so cool
conceptually the design is stellar
not that theres anything wrong with that being that im azn myself but shit man i felt like i was in china having never even been there physically i imagine in my brain that gold coast is comparable to visiting china i kid
1  25 points
i would not pick this place as my top recommendation for folks getting married in vegas and if i did i would do so with caution  make sure you really feel good about your planner and then make sure everythings going as planned on your wedding day which is really what you want to think about when youre getting ready to walk down the aisleright
great addition to jl and the cafe is more spacious than it first appears
this panda shares a food court with fast food icons including mcdonalds subway orange julies and sbarro
id give the place itself 2 stars at the moment
a further set of stairs led you to a main room which is where tiesto was supposed to play
staycations on the labor day weekend have been a tradition in my family for the past 6 years
the rooms were yuck a nasty cordouroy pillow awful view and the smallest bathroom in the world
they were extremely well staffed with efficient and pleasant employees who kept the process moving like a well oiled machine
i really enjoy playing 21  really really a lot
they were very helpful when i brought three boys into play
the grounds were eclectic and totally fit the theme of my wedding so i didnt need to do anything to decoratereallybut they let me bring in items to really personalize the day
otherwise i would definitely be looking for somewhere else to stay in cleveland
like really not good
we had to book a room here at midnight after having some altercations with our original hotel plans it was dirt cheap but obviously you get what you pay forthe room made you feel depressed and dirty
she made me feel at ease about getting the epidural and i was able to get some rest
nicht immer modern im ambiente aber gut ausgestatte zimmer
food is ok  a bit salty and not spectacular but fine for a meal out during the week
standardhotel mit ordentlichen zimmern und einem guten speisenangebot im restaurant
i must question why he was out on a friday night and he is not playing today cause he needs rest for his sprained anklemore like he is suffering from a buckhead hangover
great communication
still one of our favorite places
they only clean rooms once a week
definitely one of the most beautiful golf resorts ive ever been to
the loud music at the pool was annoying but that appears to be the case everywhere in vegas
no offer of anything else
i continue to use hilton when i travel for business
my boyfriend booked it for one night because we decided to drive to vegas a night earlier than when our other hotel was booked
always got beer in a bottle so cant speak to mix drinks either
it was our first time in arizona and we spent most of the time exploring the resort
ive not been back to las vegas since 2002 in february it wasnt due to a lack of interest just that it isnt a place i would take the kids so we decided to not travel back so often more then 8 years later the experience was less then grand and that was largely due to treasure island which is not a treasure at all
the hotel is clean but not easy to get to with either a shuttle or taxi
highlights include being told that we didnt have a room after being checked in receiving no less than 4 different rate quotes 108 to 399 to add on an extra night being told that we have no rooms left after we already changed our outgoing flight to stay said extra night that did exist just a few hours before and a security guard who never did show up as promised to let us into our rooms after we returned from seeing love excellent show btw and found that our add on night reservation had vanished from there now running computer system and we were locked out of our hotel room we were told wed have to pay a higher rate just to get back into our room and they would adjust it in the morning   side note had we called security for a more pressing situation would they have shown up then
now going to enjoy a real pizza and wings with friends
one was a room on the 9th floor which doesnt exactly scream panoramic view to me
this place is busy every time we go here but they are pretty fast
i enjoyed the historical atmosphere of the hotel along with the historical photos throughout the hallways and lobby
inside the atmosphere is warm and welcoming with charming wall arts surrounding the dining area
just a touch less would have made the entrees perfection and probably have garnered this review five stars instead of four
they told me because we used shampoo bought from the shop downstairs is the reason she slipped
i ordered an incredible hulk and the drink was really strong
crystal was short with her too
rooms are all suites with a step down living room from the bedroom
we spent about an hour until 100 am killing those we could
i had a wonderful experience during a conference
we were given the excuse that we cannot guarantee specific room types rather do our best to fulfill special requests
i shouldve asked for the womans name but when she delivered the towels she was extremely rude
service is typically very top notch and restaurants on site are known for being able to accommodate any dietary restriction and have several vegan vegetarian and vegetableladen options at each
thank you westin for ruining my wifes birthday present i will go back to staying at the hilton the 35 times a year i come to lake las vegas
gestatten sie der limousinenservice  unter diesem link httpstuttgartnachtagentendeevent02052008buddhaloungeredmandarinstuttgartlovevegaswhitechapel72749html gibt es alles zur promotion und auch einen kleinen youtubetrailer zum film
suffice it to say that this place is run by individuals who do not understand how important a satisfied customer is
maybe its just me
the butterceam was satiny my only wish was that there was more salt
hubby  i had the maniac fries large for the two and it was just the perfect size
lisa was very friendly and such as great way to begin my stay at the hotel
highly recommend for a upper casual outing
the major drawback however was the very limited assortment of vegetarian dishes  despite a very large menu
stick with beer if you are on a budget
the gelato server is a true asset as is the entire staff including the dishwasher who poked his head out and tried to help because it was busy
the potion size was not especially big but it was a nice lunch size
ive heard tell there is a buffet at the grand
turned to an all out party in the bungalow that we almost nearly absorbed the one next to us because there were so many people partying with us
i mean long
everything was excellent and very yummy
i asked if there was anything he could do
shuttle service was great
obsessed with beatles love
platter has a good portion
if it was me and my husband only im pretty sure this review will be 5 stars
the other thing is that they have a tv in the bathroom and the night we turned it on to use it it wasnt working
its the restful meditation youve been waiting for all day
even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than i had expected
i used the room phone to dial the front desk but by the time they picked up 10 minutes the smell already disappeared
had a really great time
utilized the exercise room always a treadmill available
heading there today for the last and final attempt to give this place a shot
i found this hotel a good home base in our travels around montreal
quite a bit of display area
we definitely wont be coming back again
their food is creative and delicious but still full of familiar and hearty flavors
oohhh they just very perfect in texture contrast and flavors
the crushed ice in my tea was the cherry on top it really does matter
so when i got it it was so pretty nice and golden brown
i show him that with my wireless tethering off 3g its 55 signal but with the coxparis network it is 15 low
this was the only hotel available
the size of the casino causes the feeling that there is a lack of personal touch or personality
i consider myself a total foodie and even im impressed by this food
however my experience with the hotel policy  customer service was horrible
at the age of 15 he was part of the stars of tomorrow show at the riviera
there are definitely still some kinks but once blake got involved all was well
you can hear the owner anthony yelling out waitresses names when their order is ready which adds to the charm and ambience
what a great price and my sister was delighted with the flowers delivered to her workplace on the same day as i ordered them
check movie theater
drink service was prompt at the roulette table but not so much at blackjack and let it ride
i went for brunch on a sunday with some girlfriends and we started with the bloody mary bar
before i tell you about that let me tell you all the other issues i have with this place
from our first meeting with maren it was clear that she was a music encyclopedia and instantly understood our taste in music
its great for a group of friends for social events
i love to come here not only for the chocolate croissants but because they actually have breakfast meals that dont include eggs
i think that some of the reviewers were at a different hotel as there are a few hyatts around
we had to meet some friends at tao at the venetian on a busy night
this venue has to be the top 10 worst venues out of the hundreds i have visited around the world
we met ozzie the giraffe and helped him start a painting
comfortable and clean which was just fine for our purposes but definitely not what i would have expected at a hilton resort
but still good nonetheless
of course theyd be out
i wouldnt use them again
best time to visit is during the wee hours at night or very early in the morningif youre up that late or early
not appealing to look at
bad blind application to the rules by a less than businesssavvy manager
this store seems to know its stuff and updates its selection quite often hence its connection with hard to find records
kinda hard to review though right since it was be more for the show than the building
lastly the bar while appearing to be a full bar had a very limited selection in alcohols
they are fast and friendly i will be coming back
due to the concrete and location my att mobile and wifi didnt work properly
we are new to the area and thought we would try this place out
access to monorail is great
the room was nice although it did not have a coffee maker fridge or microwave
we had the 43 prix fixe menu  i started with the blue crab cakes 7 oz beef tenderloin and the chocolateespressobaileys flourless cake
its impossible and just plain outright stupid
there are plenty of places to sit as well so not a problem there
in conclusion if youre looking for a cheap place to stow your stuff take a nap and attend to your hygiene while in vegas you might give it a try but it aint the venetian
side of fruit had moldy grapes in it
ill be staying here every time i visit vegas
cons theres a sofa bed in the living room area but no linen
just press a button and privacy lights up outside in red or service lights up in green
didnt have time to check out the pool area so thats def on my to do list the next time im here
in my opinion as well as my friends and family all the action and excitement that were looking for is too far away from this location
i stayed in the octavious tower and had a great view of the bellagio fountains
my husband and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in december while on a business trip
2 there is work inside the hotel that starts in the morning including saturday later on sunday
southwest airlines package included a 5 coupon off the buffet with our package but we couldnt use it because it was a holiday menu
i have never had a better picture taken of me
my bf went to go get ice but couldnt find the darn machine anywhere on our floor we stayed on the 18th floorthis has never happened to us where we searched through our whole floor for it and didnt find it
the coffee was good
to think international visitors come to our town imagining the city center but get weaseld here because of the low price
there was a mix up with the scheduling of leagues and it looked like we were going to be unable to play
i believe its 30 for an all day pass
this is my second trip here
so we wait about 45 minutes to watch a 5 minute motion ride from hell
spa is nice
id recommend this to kids and adults who are in decent physical shape
i cannot wait to go back
if you havent been think of it as a treasure hunt for a delicious and affordable real food not fast food lunch
if you have ga admission everyone basically stampedes into the main floor as closest to the stage
and i heard they had bed bugs in some rooms
standard rooms are circa 1997 i swear the bathroom fixtures purple leather  leopard chair and blush colored wall paper must be originals
i literally had to go buy fabreeze and desinfecting spray that night just to stay i did call front desk to let them know of how terrible room was they just said sorry and did not offer to change room or send out housekeeper
what a guy
i arrived pretty early and spoke with a manager and told her about the bad customer service i received and she upgraded me to a 1 bed room suite because of the bad service i received
no im kidding
after setting in a line for thirty minutes listening to the waitresses talk about there personal life and check there phone
had a fantastic experience here a couple of weeks ago
we had room issues some that were on the very unsanitary side and had to be moved to another room that the manager of house cleaning actually cleaned for us
they also host spiritual workshops and events
this hotel had a comfortable bed and clean room but it was dated
with or without children i may add
the staff is dedicated and friendly but sometimes its hard to find themthe staffrun elevator is funky and fun but waiting for it can be a bit of a dragwe stayed here because it was close to our wedding venue and i guess id stay here again under similar circumstances but i wouldnt go out of my way
she told him we were guests and pointed on the dash to the slip guests get for free parking
become more serviceoriented then just giving excuses
one of the best pizzas i have eaten
i am very disappointed in housekeeping
no complaints here
definitely saves you money
rude  disrespectful
they could easily provide a little more sauce as the food seems kind of dry
have you ever thought to yourself were should i eat for breakfast
after 60 minutes the waitress came out and said they had inexplicably run out of duck
after firing at each other penn dropped the fired bullet out of his teeth into my hand and asked me to verify my initials were still on it
i had the red velvet which was okay but not inspirational
we did some lessons at the henderson rec
housekeeping was varied
the unit is also on the side of the room so temperature distribution was extremely skewed
oh and the shuttle service was fine
we love mandala bay  but if we think about the expenses on the hotel we always decide to do a staycation instead
of course the last time i stayed here i have very vivid memories involving an ice bucket and an ann taylor bag
lovely lobbybar and cafe with perfect service and nice fireplace and live music and piano bar
paid for the upgraded view which was effectively not available becasuse of window washing
if you are sitting at a ground floor table closest to the counter you are afforded a view of a sea of buttocks as others wait in the line then try to squeeze by after they pay
he even fits women in tuxes when the need presents itself
the imperial palace is a prime example of a casino that desperately needs remodeling if it hopes to survive in the everchanging vegas strip the main entrance was pretty hohum and no fancy gimmicks or hooplah that you find in the more modern casinos
she was super responsive after we reminded her
bed was comfy
i checked in about 530 went down and let them know about the broken refrigerator and about three hours later they brought another one
if 14 star was an option thats what id give it
the breakout rooms are pretty small classroom sized maybe 20 people to be comfortable
they are super buttery and delicious
the stage stands a mere foot above a front row audience area kareem abduljabbar would still tower over any performers aside from maybe a shaquille oneal monologue which would be amazing but i digress
i hadnt eaten at az sandwich company in years and i had a reminder why after my last visit
and who can go wrong with 2 dollar domestic pints
the puzzles were challenging and we had the opportunity to work together as a group to figure out how to find our way out
i thought the steak was a bit bland for my liking but everything else was so perfect i didnt care
the room that my  the deluxe continental breakfast offered make your own wafflesthat was the highlight
disclaimer i didnt actually stay at the marriott cleveland airport but the shuttle service impressed me so much that i want to give the driver a shout out
casino was spacious not as smokey as some and had several convenient barslounges integrated with the floor if you just want to chill and not gamble
i have stayed at the venetian bellagio ceasars and mgm and the palazzo is the only way to go  my new go to place
5 days 4 nights at the skyrise tower two queens with 20 food  beverage credit booked on expedia  checkin information checkin time starts at 3 pm minimum checkin age is 21 your room will be guaranteed for late arrival fitness center access internet access may be limited phone calls may be limited inroom coffee resort fee usd 1295 per accommodation per night good and cheap hotel that is family friendly
ive been travelling all over the world for the last 17 years and i had the worst experience at any hotel ive ever stayed at
after 30 min i had to stop work and lay in the bed as my back started hurting
we had an appetizer that was undercooked but as it was a vegetable ok  we ordered sangria in a liter
i was a bit disappointed that the business center required you to pay to access the internet
book online to get a discounted price or go to costco for discount gift cards
the puzzles were super logical with no red herrings our preference
luckily they were quick bathers and it only lasted for about 20 minutes each time but it was enough to wake us up
they have a big selection and i have tried several things
i would def stay here again vs the overpriced for nothing disappointing strip hotels
i was hesitant about staying off the strip for the first time but  enjoyed it
if it wasnt for that id give them 3 stars
you could get pretty much the same thing except for the location and maybe more from a much cheaper smaller hotel
and what the hell is with the pool
but its free and the valet does a great job at getting your car quick
for locals the tickets are 49 each not including tax so call in and make your reservations
on the contrary it was quite classy and relaxed inside
food in the restaurant in the lobby was great as well
theres also a stage which has small bands playing on the weekends
i really didnt care
if you are walking on the strip do not walk till here
i think they allow nonhotel guests into the pool area
its right on the canal as well so it has great ambiance
gym and pool they have a pretty decent gym and pool area
i was staying by myself and did it for a total of 55 after tax
i love rock and roll but theres something anticlimactic about this place
i was assured that there would be notations on the account in order to have an updated room andor a strip facing room
i love the mostly everything about the hard rock
oh yes there were two forgettable courses  the amuse was a tablespoon of guess what halibut cevice
no nightlife entertainment is really offered here unless you count the revolution lounge beatles themed
happy hour here from 9pm  12am
will definitely come back and stay here when i have to go back later this year
she said  if we wanted to bring the arrangement in to the shop they could look at and clean it up  no mention on replacing it
there is also a mexican restaurant but i have yet to try that
this place is a great place to lounge around while enjoying a good conversation with friends or even with your boyfriend
in fact they do a whole routine about the intimacy of closeup magic that is projected on a big screen for those in the back of the audience and the diversions created by the cameraman
im sure that i drove the poor girl crazy with my endless emails and questions but she was always quick to respond and very polite and professional
ive probably eaten at about 8 different hawaiian places in the vegas valley  i give my local place island flavor the gold
the attendant there said that they only play team games during the overnight kid parties
im giving a detailed explanation of my walk for all the ladies wearing heels
while i did notice the policies posted i do believe it would be a great practice to give a brief overview of the policies to each guest which she did not do
i really hoped for more
they are sadly no longer a locals casino and that seems to be what management is angling for
i enjoyed our recent stay at the golden nugget overall
yes the flamingo is in a great location
the convenience of our hotel made for a great experience
the doubletree has seen its day
i love studying there since it tends to be rather quiet but always has good seats
although my first experience here was meh the hottest thing about the club the gogo dancers
our panoramic window revealed a brick wall and a large ac duct
why should we pay any resort fee not to mention we should get some sort of incentive because of no lights and crap connectivity
because the owner is from poland and she is making the real deal pierogies
update as it needs to be updated
my group stayed this past weekend march 17 st patricks  through march 20 and it was a hella good experience
im actually writing this review from my room at the aloft
all staff is very sweet and friendly
the result was the same we ended up eating most of our meal with our coats on us and our food quickly lost its heat
i especially liked the ambience
the price is great and the food delish
i went to the front desk and instead of looking up the reservation they told me to wait for a text
this guy is unbelievable
i planned a destination wedding for us
3restaurants are just average for vegas
the climate control is more than adequate it is accessed by a digital thermostat on the wall
the waitress told me she would get me more water and never returned
the only real issue we had was trying to find the place as we were looking for the hoover dam and the sign out front says quality inn
hands down freakin awesome for fast mexican food  frijoles has the homecooking taste
my favorite thing here is the courtyard
reflecting on my stay let me keep it real with all of you guys
no seafood  sadly enough
each lunch was in its own little box with everyones name on them and each had a side everyone got to choose one of the following potato salad fresh sliced fruit cup pasta salad frog eyed salad  sounds gross but very yummy or a bag of chips then each box also included a pickle cookie condiments and utensils
i mentioned we were seeking wedding cupcakes and the staff seemed unresponsive
my favourite is a tie between the veal sandwich and steak sandwich
it was an hour of waiting before we called again and the lady on the other end of the line essentially said we hadnt been clear in our requests
the internet is free for only 2 devices or else its 1499 a day
it is expensive but theres no reason to dock a star just for that
well im more than glad it wasnt
this is an older bw property motorlodge style that has been updated nicely
i enjoy the wynn  encore hotels before i found this gem
listen im a local and i know the food and beverage industry and there was no logical reason why we had to wait 1 hour to be seated when there were only 15 tables in front of us and half of the restaurant was waiting to be bussed
finally able to put our order in of a vanilla latte and 2 breakfast burritos
really enjoyed our stay
stopped in for lunch and had the peppered steak with rice and a mancinis roll
we had 2 each an that was it for us since wed already had two 12 yard sticks from fat tuesdays earlier in the night on the strip
i was given a look that could only be described as being full of contempt and told phones get stolen here all the time
a tip  dont touch the honor bar  it is monitored by weight
dishwasher didnt work
bed about 250 and cabanas around 1000
ive also had the bonein ribeye which is good and was cooked medium rare
we did call and towels were brought to us promptly
but then again its vegas so coming out of a casino smelling like cigs cloves and booze only means that you enjoyed yourself
i go to my new room and now that im super paranoid and grossed out i turn the mattress over and pull out all the sheets
the bar downstairs stocks hendricks gin so they deserve props for that
i ate two poor to mediocre dinners here both with tabs in excess of 50 including tax and tip
we booked here because it  was one of the cheaper and better options for edc
all in all i would probably never pay to stay here again and wouldnt really recommend anyone else either
worst an option for smoking and none
tons of restaurants and shopping
it was sometimes super slow and sometimes not working at all
from the helpfulness at the front desk to the comfort of my room it makes being away from home much more manageable
the staff was great
its delicious sure
id actually give this place a 35 if i could
service  awesome
the staff are friendly take out orders are ready when promised and the food is delicious
i have nothing but great things to say about the hot shot vegas crew
i will definitely be back again soon perhaps to try out the dinner menu
definitely need to try if you havent already
i just got married at the farm in april and it was nothing short of perfection
definitely plan your visit when you have time off work during the weekday and  absolutely look into the combo deals because if you dont it could get very expensive
it also wasnt tossed in the dressing which i thought was weird
newer casinos have bathrooms placed better along the gaming floor
i always look forward to my meals and love chatting with synaca when she delivers
our original reservation was already prepaid through virgin holiday
whatever still cheaper than a dui
i would never let them put me here again
the venetian mandalay bay the hilton grand the mirage all have had my company at some point in time
even that wouldnt have prompted me to leave a review
but two hours of pool time and two beers for all of 12 is a pretty inexpensive chill time in my book
for the most part the sweetsalty balance was on pointthe only part that tipped it a bit too much in the direction of sweetness was the honeycomb crown
the front desk said if i wanted fresh towels i should have put them in the tub
pool nice front desk staff the valet attendantfemalew bright red hair is so kind  does a great job
instead you either have to call room service for ice or trek all the way down to the bar and ask for a bucket
if to find the best and affordable samosas in brampton area the best places are one on airport road and derry east
called customer service and were on hold for 30 mins until we gave up
she wasnt particularly nice when she said it  but i guess id be grumpy if i were all alone working night shift at a hotel too
at checkin were offered bottled soda as an alternative to bonus points
she continued to scream and cry on the phone and said to her mom and im not even drunk yet
my husband took the kids to the pool at night they were so excited that the pool never closed
it was windy this morning so paddleboarding was a nice upperbody workout that i thoroughly enjoyed as well
y were we not told that when we bought the day bed and then get it discounted
she was very honest and upfront with everything
the next day we tried to use it again for the daylight pool party at mandalay bay girls free guys 100 each  cant winem all
he pushes one glad towards me and brings my other guest a coke with no ice
im for giving everyone a shot but come on
there were lots of outlets in inconvenient locations
2 theres not a whole lot of variety in restaurants to choose from
they transferred me to security and someone was going to help me file a claim for it but the lady said she would call me back and never did
beer chose was good quantity was good but lacked on quality for the price
im so glad i kept an open mind because the food here is delicious
so she decided to play gofish and just dance around dudes and hope one would turn around and hit their dougie on her
yum and yum
plenty of slot machines available too
big space and very clean the staff is nice and polite they made sure we are having a good time the food is very good and fast the bouncers are big enough for the kids can play with out getting hurt also the place is very safe
you really have to look out for the waitress and catch her attention
but this was the first time i opted to try out the salon on property
on the plus side decor and ambience are perfect for a bistro and after a big initial hiccup the service was excellent
if you just want a quick nights sleep at a decent price then this should do
they are all over the place so if you need help finding a book they are more than willing to help
practice range is a net but plenty good for warm up
this is an update of my last review of the chandler az location
i think moisture has built up in that room over time and mold has grown under the carpet right there near the bathroom
their food is amazing and fresh while their selection in the grocery aisle cant be beat
kinda liked eating at the bar better
it turned out someone pulled the fire alarm
the hotel isnt as smokey and overly crowded as other hotels but the casino floor was still lively
es gibt tglich sehr gutes mittagsmenu zwischen etwa 712eeur
it is not a two bedroom 1800 square foot suite like the description says
took my fianc for a belated birthday dinner
i havent been to the canters there but i have been to the original in la and if its the same then its a good place to grab pastrami
stop being cheap and cough up a few more bucks and stay in the main hotel somewhere
their cookies are good
it will take you foreverwe had to wait starting on the 3rd floor  they charge you for local calling
most of all i liked the fact that four seasons has created this rather exclusive peaceful sanctuary for people who arent into that lifestyle
the basement has a nice dim lighting and loud but not overbearing music
the rooms are tiny minute you can barely get your suitcase past the bedroom door bc the bed sticks out infront of the door
i also liked the fact that even though it was fairly crowded we still were able to find some lounge chairs
service was exceptional
our brunch one morning we ubered to fairmont bagels ordered and then ubered back
as for desert you cant go wrong with a desert trolley lol i wanted to try them allbut ordered the cheese cake omg move over cheese cake factory youve been out done by far
the rooms are affordable
they provide shampooconditioner and body wash in the shower
i would not think twice about staying here next time im in madison
only downside was the pa system is subpar but that is to be expected of venues of this caliber and it didnt totally ruin my experience
i had asked last year shortly after the patio was completed if it was ok and was told no problem
the walk to the strip is longer than you think
of the 20 or so girls there they did not live up to the name you look for
overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff
sobo loft the new venture from the original owners of green with envy is fully stocked with loads of gifty items
also you either have a nice balcony or patio with chaise lounges which was really nice in the evenings
wished there was actual clear storyline to the show
willie was super kind and made sure he found a different style seating for us and for the record we had incredible seats
its a pretty standard holiday inn express as there is a free breakfast every morning and the rooms are fairly clean
in our opinion its not worth the money
lots of bugs flying out and indoor especially during night time when dinner is served
the hair dryer was useless spinning in circles outside in the arizona heat would have dried my hair faster we tried calling the front desk a couple times throughout the trip and got their voicemail
i cranked up the ac and left for 3 hours
and speaking to my husband about the accommodations of handicap he told me that the front desk told him there is no handicap available
i wanted a nonfondant cake for my sons birthday so i went to baker wee for the convenience of it
i would come back and order this dish again
trash bags left in hallways needs to be picked up as well
some stand out flavours included hazelnut banana chocolate and pistachio
when we walked into our first room it was overwhelming stinky with weed smell
everything in the room is spotless
there was a line of 15 people snaking through the dining area waiting to pay on the way out
got stuck staying here due to the desert classic soccer tournament at 12000 a night
in other words its not exactly my cup of tea but if youre sans car this area offers plenty in the way of food drink and entertainment depending on how you get your kicks
so decided to give this place another try and went for thanksgiving dinner
well worth it
while there check out the on top of the rock resturant
i never asked for anything for free a discount a vouchercoupon or even an apology from the hotel manager
my husband is a new yorker and was looking forward to some good new york style pizza
the bread came out first with olive oil and balsamic
there s a big deli counter a bakery replete with tons of cookies and imported wines
it is hands down the best ranch dressing i have ever hadand it is homemade
upon arrival check in took over an hour and that was just the time at the counter
spaghetti lunch special
the bed was nice and soft very plush
would not recommend
i also really like that they allow the stage host to make jokes and let you warm up to laugh for the real crowdpleasers leading up to the headliner
we never hit up christian audigier so i cant comment
after trying to find it on the map and walking forever we gave up starving and ate whatever was in front of us
the staff at each location treats you like a vip
theres a long plush sofa in the living room thats ideal for friends to hang out
avoid this hotel unless you must have a bed because bad weather wont allow for outdoor sleeping it is bad beyond imagination rooms are smell  leaky room rude staff
salted caramel custard
when we walked in to the studio we were greeted by happy smiling faces
for an older hotel it was a very nice stay
we were there in the middle of the week so it wasnt too crowded and it was easy to find empty spots but the weekend might be different
my last visit i had a stella artois the oysters rockefeller not on the happy hour menu but my favorite here and an order of garlic fries off the happy hour menu
they have a really good menu  lots of options and lots of price ranges which is nice too
other than that it was clean it was a nice looking place and it smelled like fresh carrots all the time
towel service was on point
they have a bar with all the assortments of sauces you can get your hands on and that fun new coca cola soda dispenser that lets you make your own soda
the service at checkin and even just to drop off your bags for storage was slow and not the level of care you typically see at nicer hotels
the prime rib was awesome same for the blt and the mozzarella sticks and parmesean fries
achtung die minibar ist leer
he needless to say had no leftovers to bring home
it was actually pretty cool seeing all the old slot machines
had a wonderful two night stay here at mandalay bay
its maybe a bit overwhelming for kids because that is their only communication from the staff just like a real race and they are already so focused on the different pedals controls turning etc
im going to chalk up my bad experience to the fact that the online ordering service is still new and theyre working out the kinks still
sehr preiswerter mittagstisch 2009 690eur den wir hufiger mit unseren kunden nutzen
theres a nearby ish uber lyft pick up spot so its not horribly inconvenient
we both ordered slow cooked brisket i think the waitress said about 7 hours
we were starving so as soon as the waitress came we ordered oxtail soup all around
it wasnt a mind blowing experience for her but rather eh it was ok   the room was extremely small and the way the chairs were positioned were not the greatest
is it the fanciest hotel
regardless if you stay here or not you must must must see le reve which is at the wynn theater
yes you heard correctly
p  drinks  room service cocktail  gin strawberry lemon juice and champagne
after hearing our plight the nice attendant at the plaza didnt charge us the fee
this definitely does not make the hotel bad but you can find a much more vibrant and exciting atmosphere at any of the other casinos around it
kinky and awesome for a couple but interesting for a group of friends
had a staycation here last weekend and loved it
i received really great customer service
original 1762 pretty good 45  7 roast beef sandwich horse radish cheese
i also passed on the spa because it looked crowded and had a feeling it would of sucked just like the pool
we were just messing around looking through what we got and trying to find room for the food i brought from home and i was immediately changed 75
maybe i dont have enough of a sweet tooth for this but i think you would have no teeth if you ate this regularly
the restaurant was very expensive60  for breakfast
allergy attacks like never before allergic to mold review my roommate and i stayed here for a convention in april 2016 we stayed a total of seven nights and it was a very uncomfortable experience to say the least
so the thing i can talk about the beer
yes its a simple tip for the workout
first off i used to stay here when i was younger glad i didnt care about the amenities and atmosphere when i was little or else i would have had a horrible time
towels that have actually seen softener and dont hurt to touch your skin
the only reason i didnt rate it a five star was because of the bathrooms which seemed like no one checked in on since multiple stalls had no toilet paper and they seemed a wreck
if you have family go to ti or mirage
i was walking like jack sparrow the focus was blurry but i wasnt dumb and i could straighten up to get past the bouncers
this is such a great place
she than asked us to upgrade for 400 per night to a room that does have two queens
went to the buffet on mondayarrived in line at 1105 as we get there a little early as we have 1 hour lunch
the event security is also apparently largely ineffective
cons wasnt the biggest fan of the lobbyfound it a bit dimly lit not lively and didnt put me in the best mood
i absolutely love it here
staff is always friendly and fast
also not great shopping
i also purchased a late check out and still had an additional knocker ask when i was leaving what i needed etc
my family came here to have dinner prior to going to zoo lights
one of the oldest casino on the strip and it looks it
it was a very difficult decision for us to make
it may not be cute but its super cheap and has a convenient location on the strip
if you are a ashamed that you are a freak then move out of the picture
surprisingly enough they also brewed some really good italian roast
try it or diet final word diet
for some reason we have to come to a company party here every year
i offered to show them on the app how the price would not changeshe continued shouting and being rude even though i never raised my voice
we have found our new place for  red meat
everything is very clean and modern and at a good price
we met michelle and her camera at a recent yappy hour at the salty seniorita in north scottsdale
we had a newer remodeled room that looks like that just put a bandaid on it to seem like they redid it completely
das sind die topmodernen in denen an nichts gespart wurde und die dadurch in anderer weise ebenso imposant sind wie die traditionshotels
there are basic sandwiches snacks and drinks but they also offer full meals such as meatloaf and they sell wine and beer as well
i didnt look at the other places to eat there
there is also a big gallery space stylishly adorned with beautiful photographs at that time
took him to the emergence room where they confirmed that he was bit by bed bugs and also found live flees in his pajamas
definitely a good family style italian restaurant
wasnt disappointed but hate that they were out of ribs
lots of germanesque food but not necessarily mainstream german
she deserves a great raise
take out is quick dine in service is not
when i was a wee chan i visited the sahara several times with my parents
the place is quite crowded and if you are a gringo you could be the only westerner there which i suppose tells something positive about the quality of the food
wonderful boutique hotel
we ended up getting a lemon chicken dish baked ziti and green beans
i wasnt sure which door to go to so i wrongly picked the one closest to my car
we booked the room back in june and on monday of the weekend we were heading out i called in to confirm
she was very efficientknowing that i had little time she had me in and out of the studio in half an hour but the photos turned out to be amazing
plus the checkin line was really long and only two or three people were working it
on top of this i had a greek salad too omg do not order the pathetic greek salad which consists of one olive and one cucumber with tasteless dressing and wilted lettuce
watch your charges though in the restaurants and your room
each bed had three pillows all different but all had a plastic cover below the case
eager like the first time when i wanted to see the tigers i wanted to see the new and improved mirage what an improvement it is
inside there are  high ceilings purple hazed lighting and if you get to peek out beside the bar a killer view of the financial district
parking is close and the views are tremendous
my girlfriend and i stayed here this past weekend for a girls weekend away
i would stay here again if i can get the cabana suites at a decent rate
they nail their proteins but the supporting acts are a hit or a miss
sorry we were there for a vacation  only see each other a few times a year
i was confirmed for a strip view wrap around balcony suite at check in but of course they dont have a room ready for me so then why confirm itoffer me something else insteaddont let me wait around for 2 hrs
make the drive to party city
i was very happy with the service from the office folks who first answered the phone when i called to the drivers who set uptore down the whole enchilada
there were some pieces that were too burnt but the flavor was good
i wouldnt recommend dining at this hotel but youre not to far from some pretty good places to eat
love the food and decor
but as a consummate diner i was happy to sample new fare
its a welcome indulgently cheesy break from subway and paradise bakery
if you have stayed at paris and caesars or bellagio or any of the good casino hotels they are all fine so to truly be special they have to be really good
like the hard rock it can be loud it can also have a much younger crowd
its not as luxurious as the aria or venetian is but for the priceits totally worth it
i tried the homeec martini which i found to be tasty and not too sweet
i have a bittersweet feeling about those shows as the mirage is both a good and bad spot for them
the bathroom is ok renovated
nice places to eat and you can tell they take care of the place
we were seated outside under a mister that was more like  london drizzle than mist
do i have to repeat all you can drink
while i wasnt fully blown away by the two sandwiches i tried i ordered the original and my gf got the full montague they were still great sandwiches
sides i really enjoyed the santa maria beans with salsa and grilled potatoes
i went to the market with about 24 dollars cash after a yoga class
it was like i was watching the sinatra of magic
its an informal place
and other times its been well over an hour
they used to serve breakfast during week but sadly now its only on weekends
we had the time of our life and will return again next season
everything was super clean and maid service was performed regularly
they have a ton of celebratory balloons to add that personal touch to your event
because of this it got very stuffy
it was about 230am after saturday nights show the rowdiest one yet when a friend of mine texted me and one of my hotel roommates an invite to the party
and the foodwellit took over an hour and a half for our hot dogs two of them and chips and dip
best hotel ever
when youve been on a plane for an hour flying from a cold cold city itching to take off your clothes and switch to a bikini the last thing you need is a long check in process
we got married here june 25th and amy made everything super easy and she is very sweet
id been to another location years ago
from the hostess to the servers everyone is always courteous and extremely hard working
well definitely be back and ill likely fail at stopping myself from eating three plates again
their shops were great the canal was beautiful the staff was very polite and helpful and the location of the hotel enabled us to leave our rented van in the garage so we could walk to most of our destinations on the strip
the entire hotel was very responsive even with our late nightearly morning requests
im not into strangers germs all over my baby
i called the front desk about the dirty room and was on hold 8 minutes
it needs major upgrading
i finally tried this place close to home
one of the best fine dining restaurants not only in pittsburgh but in any state
ok maybe the ice ran out theyre busy
we split the especiale for two which is basically fajitas with shrimp chorizo steak and chicken and still have a large lunch for the next day
clean comfortable beds wonderful interstate access to and from this location
one thing i dont miss is the smoke that permeate throughout casino to the hotel reception through to even the nonsmoking rooms and the burnt holes in the carpets and sheets
this hampton inn is pretty grand if you need to situate yourself in downtown burgh
fun place to shop for unique gifts
i want my house to look and feel like this
versus the megahotels where itll take 20 min
samosas used to be good but looks like the owner is trying to reduce quality ingredients in order to save money
they are on a little island on the edge of the strip
this was sooooo much better
they have all your favorite table games endless slots high end shopping and plenty of fine dining
we were placed on the first floor and went back and asked for something higher and with out hesitation they moved us to the 6th floor
we wont ever eat here again especially since everything was pretty bad
also they dont have any beers on tap so be prepared for 4 for a bottle or can
the aquifer under this place allowed for construction of everything you see in the town of vegas
i would definitely come back to this hotel
conveniently they forgot to mention that coffee in the room costs 10 and there is no hairdryer
all in all id go back
no apologies from the other assholes
by early im referring to las vegas and probably france hours think 10am as the crack of dawn
down to two after a second and last trip to this place
the only thing that went wrong in our room was when our bathroom door handle had been jammed and we were unable to open the door from the outside
bath time fun babie
and we enjoyed our time there
they said it was just too big and we ordered from a regular place
theyre nicer than the suites at palazzo mandalay h2h etc
i came here for a company training retreat and thought this was one of the better venues they chose compared to previous events
love this place
i can look over the edge and see the city lights
so up to the room i go
never go back to that place
we live near by and it was a perfect date night for me and my fianc
they have better desserts than bellagio
then i was told they were closed after being told 3 times they would be right with me
an elevator that goes diagonally up and down the chance to stay in a pyramid and easily one of the most recognizable hotelcasino combos in vagas the view dependent on your room and finally the price was good for being on the strip we even got a free dinner with it
i went to two shows located here during my stay and i must say that they were fantastic
their pool is totally awesome
i have to confess not bad  all
my 11 year old easily swam everywhere but it was extra nice that i could navigate all over with my 4 year old  hes swimming but still feels more secure when im around
all because i was trying to tell her how not to try and sell me  hard sale
i was so angry but i was drunk so i hung up and and just went on with my birthday weekend
the potato salad is disgusting more like mashed potatoes they threw some left over stuff into
nice hotel lots of restaurants
not to mention that there were flies everywhere
resort is spread out and you do a fair amount of walking which isnt a problem except the lighting at night is really poori found myself stumbling around in the dark nervously trying to find my room without falling down any of the poorly marked steps that are everywhere
we werent feeling the vibe although the bartender was really nice to us
obviously this place is exciting for the young ones as for the adults adding alcohol made it a lot better  but very dirty and the help seems very incompetent
i also loved the shower design rain fall head and soap dispenser only my towels had some stains on them which is always a fail when not staying at the motel 6 like the idea and design of this place but it kind of failed for me
i can happily say that it exceeded my expectations
one of the best things ive seen in my life
for only 55 per night the night we stayed
i cant recommend this room at all
great dinner spots here not really much for breakfast or lunch but dinner they are covered on the bad theres no place to get food by the pool
sorry parentshot tubs arent swimming pools
chamorro grill in san diego was much better and bigger portions
however we received the following unexpected bonuses 2 breakfast vouchers a 5 off coupon to the barrestaurant and 2 drinks with appetizers vouchers
can i just say i know this might not sound like a compliment but the biscuit sandwich reminded me of my longlost days ordering shmiscuit from scheetz and eating this fast sammy made me ohsohappy
i found that these made the most impression upon my family and friends
gb right across the street the banks are only a block or two away and there are choices of eateries everywhere
i could only imagine what it would be like to stay here
unfortunately it was bad for any standard
we drove around for a while looking for a spot and couldnt find any parking signs to help us figure out how to not get a ticket during our short stay in the city
last year we were in florida and this was so much better
great alternative to starbucks or its a grind
checked in today
but enjoyable is not the word i would use when forced to wake up at 5 am hearing coooo cooooooooooooo cooooo coooooooo cooooooo
im extremely heart broken
reading all the reviews of the hotel seems like a lot of people had similar if not a worst experience im adding to this review in hopes that whoever owns this place that they please read the reviews and see all the pictures posted and possibly make some changes
there is no alcohol there which i was aware of but the experience is unbearable without it
a recent third charge
our stay was perfectly fine aside from the issues we experienced with the door to our room
the first time they were able to issue a key
i love the feeling of sinking into the comfortable bed each night and having a restful sleep
although i still ended up with a bruise
oh bellagio i remembered so much better then this stay
i was a bit worried that my 10 and 7 year olds would get bored after a while but we opened and closed the water park down each day
the portion is filling and the taste is excellent
chickfila sandwiches are always in my agenda
there is also a movie theater arcade and a bowling alley
my confirmation email specifically said to cancel through the hotel and when you click the link it takes you directly to hooters and gives you hooters number to call for cancellation
total playing time about 20 minutes
i recommend just going out on your own because there were too many clubs to actually enjoy your time at one
well worth the money
in fact one morning i had a bit of a hangover so i placed the do not disturb on my door so that i would not be bothered in the morning by housekeeping
once we got to the room we were surprised as to how nice it looked
we get many compliments on the wall art work we made through shutterfly and our album as appearing like a professional photographer took them
happy to have chick fil a in vegas
yeah were good onto the room we had a one bedroom suite equipped with a whirlpool jacuzzi full size kitchen kingsize bed dining area spacious living room complete with a pullout sofa bed and two flat screen tvs
the room felt old as well definitely not worth the price of a suite
will come again
one of the things i like about this place are the staff members
so i decided to give a1 sweets a try
the hubby and i decided last minute to look for a restaurant on new years eve
those pretzels are delicious when dipped into a pot of silky provolone cheese
my girlfriend and i treated ourselves to the 2pm tea and had such a lovely time
he was awesome
as a party of two youll have to agree on an entree because they are served family style with enough food for 3  we agreed on the rigatoni which was outstanding
oh and drunks spilling their drinks all the time
we did arrive about 1pm and was afraid the room was not ready but she managed to move some reservations around and gave us the keys to the room
the dance floor can get very overcrowded
gold coast has landed right on my lets not las vegas list
valet parking that does not gouge you on either the price or the service
we had asked for a nonsmoking room
there are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall
my friend left 50 in the bed and the maid came back to our room to tell us where she had left the money bc she found it in the bed
my fianc and i were engaged for almost a year and planned on a vegas wedding
he says not to worry i wont actually be charged 600 dollars and it will come off of my card when we check out
my daighter has fun with the other kids
theres also a walkway escalator thingy that leads to the excalibur from the lux inside which i thought was pretty cool
we let them know how horrible our stay was
we cant wait to come back
i wouldnt hang out in the room
thats her favorite place
the quality of the food okay nothing special to write home about
the photographer had so much fun with that
if your flight arrives at around 10am like ours did youd be better to go out for breakfast or lunch first and then register at the hotel afterwards
we heard from several friends how good it was so we had to try it out
i will definitely be returning soon to try more things
further the rio was absolutely rude about extending our check out time
are they that paranoid
i would definitely recommend utton photography to others in the real estate industry or frankly anyone that is looking for a great photographic product
perfect location better than chipolte
chicken teriyaki salad  we ordered this just to get some greens in the mix
dark with a young hip feeling
there are elevators a small bathroom but how many people need to be in there at once
so much so that i can more or less forgive the slew of minor annoyancesinconveniencesnitpickswhathaveyou
its so clean and the staff is so sweet
it was my first time staying here and i would recommend
then another waiter stopped and said our waiter said to tell us our food would be out soon
i was researching prices and resort fees parking fees etc for our  trip to las vegas
the bread was soft and the meats were cut just right and not too thick
but at the end of the day it is still one of my favorite places in tempe
and they entice you with a sample of baklava and oh boy
staff are unfriendly and quite rude
also not enough ports where we can plug in things so we had to bring our own
she gave a put upon huff and said she would be back
i wish we would have stayed somewhere else or tried the grand tower
we have relied upon henri for all of our photography needs for several years now
why oh why did you have to close
i was pretty annoyed cause i had a group already at liquid  httpwwwyelpcombizliquidpoolloungelasvegashridiwnxb2v2xwqhtarydmhjwsrcself  waiting for me
not the butter and garlic drenched monstrosity served elsewhere
i would advise parents to supervise their children when they are bouncing with other kids because accidents happen and if youre my youngest and incredibly clumsy son accidents will happen all the time
fantastic food good service solid ambiance
just a great atmosphere
cant say that i have ever had a bad meal here
we started with the spinach chaat with potatoes chick peas and spices
the sandwich had a great balance of flavors and very enjoyable
you were even allowed to bring in your own cds to sing to
stay somewhere else please
it was fine
my son ordered the hamburger with cheddar cheese from the regular menu which came with shoestring fries  i ordered the rib eye with roasted corn and mashed potatoes
they did have a ethernet cord but how inconvenient is that
soon i am sure they are due for another renovation as you can tell the rooms have wear and tear
or because the darn oysters are so delicious
the gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels
not even close to the original carolinas in south phoenix
i have been to magenta at fairview promenade mall upper canada and vaughan mills
i love their set up for the circus show they have bleachers set up for audience and no matter where you are you can see the show even if you are downstairs gambling
the signage and building arent flashy but the food is always yummy and satisfying
we went to check in through the thick cigarette smoke that permeated the casino
this restaurant really recreates that feeling
i would recommend staying at this place as like its hotel name its like a second homeapartment
we had standard rooms booked  mandalay and tried the 20 sandwich trick httpwwwthetwentydollartrickcom and got 2 successful upgrades to thehotel
the wait staff was very gracious and service was fast
i would rate it a 35
if youre alight sleeper someone in another room could wake you during a late night potty visit
i love this stuff one of the best i have tasted
this is a timeshare so beware that they will definitely try and sell you the property so that was expected
she agreed with one day rental for 165
to make a long story short after much reassurence they were coming they never came
it was the epitome of a canadian dessert
pool restaurants retail stores and variety of casinos were all great
purchased an item on amazon
i paid 178 for a tux rental here
the douche bags who i worked with that owned it wouldnt pay their bills
we never heard our neighbors housekeeping was excellent
i never have that problem anywhere
best vegas stay ever
great music  nirvana
we stayed in a smoking room which whatever
fortunately ive stayed at this holiday inn three of those times
very impressed with this place in the hidden quiet neighbourhood of busy ave tachereau in brossard
they do catering and delivery though not sure if they deliver individual meals
this is by far my favorite place to get italian
guaranteed to be impressed
i probably have some sour grapes over the id thing so im  bumping what i was tempted to leave at three stars to four because i get that i can hold a grudge sometimes
service was great
they offered to move us but the kids were sleeping so they gave us a dirtydusty fan
and she had them on her
boy was i wrong
yeah the 56 a night deal not worth it
rip to the girl who passed away in this and kudos to all the performers in this enchanting and mesmerizing show truly amazing what they do in this show
only satisfying part was they changed both the orders
events the size of ours should be where they excel
the repair guy came quickly and turned it off
its no illusion
the location is off the strip but it was about a 5minute walk from the wynn
having missed a chance at thomas kellers french laundry when we were in napa we had to check out bouchon when we got to las vegas and we were not disappointed
beautiful artwork friendly atmosphere and affordable prices
so random and tacky but it was cool
otherwise the experience was great
ive driven past it a million times and judging from the outside it certainly doesnt look like anything special
the accent navy blue wall housed 12 hooks  a simple yet impractical organizer system
they also have a lot of cute photo opportunity areas with scarecrows hay stacks or even fun cardboard cutouts for the little ones
the dealerentertainers are incredibly amusing featuring various celebrities like beyonce katy perry shakira lady gaga rihanna michael buble and several more
we were having a good time and you were trying everything to end it
i was in scottsdale for my bachelorette party this month and cannot say enough great things about this establishment
try  youll be hooked
we ordered cheese fries to go with our beer
if you could help it dont stay here
the front desk connected a man to my room at 4am he only gave them my first name too which is brittany  not the most uncommon of first names at 4am
if you sit towards the back it might be hard to see the little section before the actual moving stage
staff very friendly and courteous
and stop charging for internet and a gym that few use
maybe some blocks are better than others
you also dont feel overwhelmed by the music due to the open air facility and conversation is actually possible unlike many other live band bars
the dish tasted great but i wish the presentation was more like a traditional caprese
a note to the management of the hawthorn suites 1 a half wall and a love seat do not a suite make 2 lets step into the 21st century some wireless please 3 women like conditioner and lotion
and the resort didnt carenot good
came here with some new friends from a work training for a birthday
the secret sauce adds a nice twist to it too
i call it like i see it
if you are deciding where to stay next time you are going to vegasi would really recommend staying at the wynn or the new hotel aria  next time no more palms
aok is my assessment
too many couches pillows you name it
if you have a family friends or extended family this is the place for you
this place is clearly not a restaurant
the suites are beautiful spacious and clean
the rooms are huge and everythings still pretty new
the wet bar area has plenty of lightning but does not extend to the living room
the manager on duty had no interest in helping this man
i liked the tall ceilings in the lobby and main hallways
when i bought the tickets i wasnt given the option of adding a meet and greet or dinner package when i was checking out
while everything is great i have fallen in love with the enchiladas especially the green sauce and the the cheese crisp
it is directly connected to an underground area with restaurants and shops
but comfy beds and working showers
on our way out we shared an absolutely scrumptious cannoli  perfect blend of creaminess and sweetness and obviously freshly baked
in the same way my favourite dessert their fantastic baklava is only available at the take out counter and not at the dessert buffet
hopefully next time our experience might be a bit better food quantity wise
the food was good
they should have at least included some basic acrobatics or juggling but not even that
saw the show at dirty at 1230 at the southpoint  hotel
do yourself a favor and dont stay herethis place is no better than a motel
one tip  the valley ho makes up the beds european style so there is no top sheet
the pro is that this hotel is close to downtown scottsdale where there are alot of eateries and clubs around
mit witz charm und viel wein wurde es ein gelungener abend
one thing i did find my self asking is if they had a nursing area
this is a wonderful place with great staff
well worth it and you actually get what you paid for and a complete order
it also has squashy couches and a couple of arm chairs
i suppose thats at every hotel though
i cant talk money about this place because i didnt pay for anything my entire stay
the shower reminded me of a spa alcove
if i could give them no stars i would
there are a bunch of bars and restaurants around and its right next to pitt u which was a plus
it is now about 430 pm and i called the front desk and told them what was happening and they changed my room to another room on the 28th floor and was told to reuse the same keys
although it is off the strip it isnt completely alot
