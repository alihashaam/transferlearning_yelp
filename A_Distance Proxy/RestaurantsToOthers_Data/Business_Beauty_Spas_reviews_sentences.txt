they have an amazing selection of colors
she was the best
i booked on sunday because thats usually my day off
although i did not get the stylist people suggested i got kosuke i still feel that he is unqualified to be charging that much for a typical comb over that my friends can do for me
sarah is fantastic
happy to support local businesses
the place is very clean i might add
they made great chit chat and exuded pure toenail talent at the same time
shila is amazing
i love it
first place i came to was 1st choice as it is nearby my residence
she is so talented
she used warm oils that felt so soothing
i probably never will but if i did
also she filed almost all of my nails crookedlynormally i would have complained but she was so unfriendly i just wanted to get out of there
she answered using a curse word
my husband and i moved to north carolina about a month ago so were still fairly new and ive been dying for a haircut
he was also pleased with how i had kept up his tips and tricks he shared during my last visit  my bangs are at the perfect length  not too short not too long  even still look a little livedin which i love
seriously if youre gonna pay to get hair ripped off your body this is probably the best place to do it
she gave me tips on how to style the boys hair and it stays that way
while she was not stingy about applying lots of expensive product on my hair it didnt really help much as my hair was a tangled frizzy mess when she was finished
hes been taking care of my nails for years  and i never leave unhappily
the tropical pedicure was great and so relaxing
i made an appointment here for two my sister and i first when i called i made it clear that we want to get the nails done together however they only had one technician available the other lady was busy with another customer
i briefly considered getting waxed there because they supposedly have a good reputation for their waxing services but i dont think its worth being treated so poorly
theyre great for a natural look and when i put makeup on i feel like a starlit
i went here because of the positive yelp reviews and they were able to schedule my friend and i for a manipedi appt right away went early afternoon
will def be back
my hair is curly and my  curls are various sizes  but mostly  from small curls to smaller ones
i dont expect anything more than 4 weeks and the rockstar polish and diane gave me exactly what i expected
love my tragus piercing from cooley today
as the bride i felt that my hairstyle was perfectly romantic and exactly what i wanted for my big day
my nails are exceptional
1 before passing through the doors into this pleasant destination please leave your cynicism in the dumpster behind the building
every therapist is trained by the owners so that you get the best experience let me start by saying the atmosphere and the beds to their linens are of top quality better than the big known resorts in the area
i hear theyre doing massages there now too
she did all this while there were still two nails that she hadnt painted properly at the tip  one wasnt painted in the corner and the other was all bubbly
these asian people know darn well that they pay for these products wholesale which they get very cheap and then what to charge people out the a and then you spend all your gas just to find these pathetic hair stores
check them out
i usually ask whos ever working on my toes to go a little harder on my footleg massage and they have no problem doing so
i have no idea why i keep coming back to this location
when i come back the same man who greeted me at the door was now in her spot
so i leave a message the woman calls me back about 6 hours later
i have a lot of hair and she was able to work her magic from start to finish
which took me forever to fade and i even showed her a picture
the staff are all very nice they do however try to sell you other services but are not overly pushy
well be back
he also offers excellent service squeezes me in and does a great job very quickly because he knows i have a tight schedule
i got french tips and each nails white line was of varying thickness but from a couple feet away it looks good
it was cheap and that was fine it was my bday and our anniversary weekend
the lashes themselves last up to about 3 weeks and she does a great job at customizing whatever look youre going for
shes the very best
water and tea and candy is available while waiting
also the worse cuticle trim ive ever had
the charges on my bfs card are fine but they have no reason to be charging me
the best part was the kitchen
it really depends on the style you like and which teaching style you prefer
the lady who answered the phone took down my name etc and said see u tomorrow at noon
dont recommend for dark sking people didnt work and too expensive
first stylist in 20 years who gave me some good advice on how to style my hair with the cowlick i have
he was trying to roll his fingers over my chest
ive had sugaring done before at the most reputable spas in the city
they were right on time with my appointment
even my dad is a fan
also it was over 100 for crappy work with no color
today i decided to attend a glass at the dc ranch location and was incredibly surprised
they have the regular bottom of the line beds beds with bronzing bulbs a step up from the bottom stand up beds and the jumbo size melt your skin off talking bed with air conditioning
ive always just driven past this hotel to and from the strip but finally we decided to stop at the m resort to try the infamous studio b buffet httpwwwyelpcombizstudiobbuffethendersonhridyqqfe3mvyvzfkfyzvexaxa
i am happy with what he created and could not imagine a better first tattoo
she pays close attention to your eye shape and will suggest what typelength would work for you
terry is very attentive as well as positive with great energy
this is the first time i have ever been to this salon and i have nothing but wonderful things to say about the salon and mischa as a stylist
reasonably priced and never a long wait
its not like were both on our feet for 8 hours a day at our jobs eye roll
after reading other reviews i thought that i had to be wary of being upsold but this wasnt the case at all
i went to get a pedi and my friend got a manicure
i think it all took about an hour which was the perfect time to relax and enjoy the pampering
initially i didnt think that was possible because of the low walls they dont go up to the ceiling the music in the lobby area and the conversations going on in that area
she is very talented
i had been looking for a cosmetic surgeon for 2 years around los angeles and las vegas and had previously seen 5 surgeons for consultations
she really knows her stuff
the other technician that works there is always pleasant and talkative during my sessions
i absolutely do not recommend anyone to get hair done here
heather the professional nail technician is very astute at identifying any issues that you might have with your nails and recommending a solutions
end result lumpy uneven different length nails
i could not have been given anyone better
being a picky person with my nails i am very very pleased and satisfied with my experience here
normally i cant relax because i feel a little awkward i know counter productive but jesse made me feel very comfortable
i cant recommend this place highly enough
but she even asked where i got my nails done as if they did not look proper enough
we will definitely stay here again
wellthe sanctuary misscheduled our appointments for 2 days prior
obligatory title pun its bloody well right
ok you have to wait so what grab a monster its free and the playboy and time flys by
luckily the discounts still make it worth the trip
i liked it so much that i joined
some are crooked he told me it was my fingers and not his filing not a great first experience
they offer water or coffee and appointments are on schedule
my boyfriend got the fb massage if you can call lightly rubbing the skin a massage and could only enjoy the fact that he at least got a punch to the foot
she shouted at me that i have no money and i need to have someone bring money or she was calling security
his lines are awesome and im always getting complimented on how well he did on the script
lots of airport noise as its right next to the airport
she has awesome skin products too
i was pleased with my experience at the boulevard
its fitting in scottsdale because its cool and hip but doesnt feed into the scottsdale pretentiousness and overall douchery
they spent quite a bit of time on the phone with me answering questions until i felt comfortable
it amounted to a sales pitch for their various services
lol this will definitely be our new pedi go to
as as soon as i mentioned that gift certificate kimmies attitude changed and she rushed through everything
my friend kerri recommended amy at prestige after i had a bad experience new my new house in queen creek
for 20 minutes later
i arrived on time the massage therapist did not
also i think i could adopt and keep you for working on my trigger points at the yelp event and again a little during the appointment for my boy
great staff and no high pressure sales which is a plus
most of the stuff they carry you can find at any drug store and theyre cleaner and not sticky and openedtried by everyone with annoying orange price tags all over them
even though i had an appointment i still had to wait to be seated and even then i had to wait for a technician
liz does amazing work and her personality makes the experience more enjoyable
and healthy hair
we were a little skeptical given the location but do not be fooled
i am traveling and found this salon by using yelp
i had a great first time experience with salon adikt
i have not had any of the other stylist cut my hair but i am sure they do a great job because they always seem to be busy
had they told us they couldnt accommodate the request we would have had a better experience
also rex took a call while he was working on the husband
thats why the 4 stars or the service is unarguably 5 stars
when i asked for their phone number to record into my outlook the girl did not know it
the pumice was white but looked very dirty
mountainside has cameras in their childcare center and screens all over the gym so you can keep on eye on your kid and make sure they are being taken care of
would come back
she is always up to date on her mens styles
im going back next week for color
si cest votre 1er massage comme ctait le cas pour moi on vous offre gratuitement un cours de yoga propos ici mme
prices are reasonable for the services you receive
from acrylics to natural manicures she gets the job done with a smile
when i was asked to choose a colour from the wall i got all nervous and asked for a light colour
yes it can be overwhelming with so many products but she made it easy
ive been to the mall plenty of times and never been approached when not carrying anything
hes very good at newschool and realistic styles as well as traditional art
sad because i used to enjoy going to this nail salon
i then questioned her why the sign outside said 20 for a pedicure and why was i being charged more
i love the complementary teadavids tea if you want to know the flavor you should go in served in a simple but classic tea cup and saucer with a cute gem cover
anyway they also know how how whip up a good cup of tea
it has a very relaxing atmosphere knowledgable staff and great attention to detail
colette does my nails regularly and a wonderful job at that
have not received a call back and it has been 2 days
love love love
so my husband told me that there was a nail salon that reminded him of new york
you know the saying that you get what you pay for  youll most likely leave this place with that reminder going thru your head
exceptional customer service the ladies were extremely polite as well as courteous and professional
what my bestfriend dragged me along and set an appointment for my first ever brazilian wax prior to stepping foot i felt sick to my stomach because i heard so many horror stories about brazilian waxes
if you have a mullet then this place is not for you
also had high quality eyelash extensions done by nia for way cheaper than what most valley salons charge
it has been about a week now and im pretty happy with the quality of the polish since it still looks great
we finally set an appointment
the staff is friendly
this spa is fantastic
i was immediately offered a bottle of water and received amazing service from a great staff
in a spa environment
in all honesty this business is clean professional a tightly run ship and everyone is super friendly
i know this harsh fact well therefore i always give deep consideration before writing a one star review
ive never tried any of them but i mostly only see them cutting womens hair
i highly recommend the gel polish  it is worth it
i was so far impressed
its not worth the pain if its not even going to make a difference
theres nothing that they will do for you when you find out youve been scammed its a huge waste of money
one would think that after that many layers of polish my nails would at least hold off on chipping for a while
so i started to question the man
to ease into it she dyed the top brown and the rest ombr
i got one of the best facials ive ever had here  monthly specials are good everyone was very nice and accomodating facility is warm  clean
i watched her head back to her station and i could tell she either said something negative about me or must have rolled her eyes because the other techs stopped working and looked up at me
i spoke chinese mainly with the guy who was helping me
i highly recommend this nail shop to everyone
yes all five in one sitting
you never realize how much a bad haircut impacts you until youve had one
will not be going back here total waste of  for a polish i could have done myself
susan tasker lifestyle pilates 6239101314
i advised him that i have a 615pm appointment and that is when he was like oh yes he apologized and stated he never seen me before and surprised that someone new had an appointment
the absolute worst place to go dont waste ur time and money
i am terrible with names grrr
very friendly you can tell she really cares about her clients
found what i wanted at another shop that was happy to have my patronage
i also didnt understand their reason for using an online pharmacy but when i asked they were able to explain that i can get products at a lesser cost
great service as always
bottom line hire competent people to great and take care of your customer
will definitely go back next time i visit
the food at the pool was the best ive ever had at a pool
the place it self looks very small and cramped
very nice and did a great job on my nails
i walked into this gorgeous area which featured a beatiful hot tub sauna and steamroom
would recommend it to my friends
what sets this one apart is the amazing staff
she is fast and great at what she does
i referred a few people and never got two of my 150 gift cards
i booked two appointments one for myself and one for my mom for mothers day
i went here to get a pedicure
i recommend 9037 or tonic salon if youre looking in this area i decided to wait until i could get an appointment at one of these
i will definitely go back to her
great to be around
im in and out every time and highly recommend dr woods and staff
i just wish other places were like this
the office was clean professional and friendly
the store was clean and it was a good experience overall
i also had some facial waxing and tinting done and it was great as well
its the only thing that was really missing that even the cheapest hotels seem to have
love love love the work and time she takes to make them perfect
once again honey fig showed how much they care for their customers
next we move to the shampooconditioning station
after paying 3 for a 16 oz
the environment is so welcoming peaceful and relaxing
first the location was not difficult to find and there was plenty of parking
he comes over and says he will be with you
they always play top 40s music which is nice
waste of money
my mom looked like she wanted to cry and said i want to leave so we got up and left
they have a really cool rewards program too
the employee was very sweet but dont waste your money
ive never had any issues regarding hygiene at this salon
i just hope she never retires
does it get any better than that
i highly recommend her
the pool area is nice and relaxing
i waited over an hour to see the doctor with a full office
i really wanted the entire earring rack but again i refrained it is setup so nicely with an upstairs and downstairs
i believe ashley has cut my hair twice super nice and she did a great job one of the best and cleanest fades ive ever gotten
go see this very sweet lady for a relaxing time
great salon wonderful spray tan
it helped up well after that
was leery because of previous reviews we were pleasantly surprised
also they never clean their work station tools or brushes
i cant wait to go back
my best friend and i decided to have a nice day getting massages
their place smells terrible and all the the stuff they use are cheap products that will harm ur nail even more
ive known cliff wolosin since 1997 and if he was any kind of a bigot i wouldnt patronize him either
without a doubt youll be taken care of in all angles
then i had sinus surgery and was out of it for about a week
constantly hear air compressor pump and walls are very thin
that is good customer service
remember to check in on yelp and get a free sample of styling product
been reusing them for 7 months so far looks and feels the same silky and full
shell exceed your expectations
since acrylic was still on my nails the polish job was horrible bumpy and sloppy
im sure he has great skills but he really needs to learn how to be polite run a business and customer service skills
well they killed my future business and that of anyone in my company
ive been here a total of 3 times
i heart platinum entourage
bottom line is they advertised 3 locations and one was closed by the time i tried to redeem my voucher
if this makes you pause then maybe consider another place
somewhat frustrated as i made a trip after work to try this place out i arrived just after 630 to see if they could fit me in for a shellac manicure and the girl although very friendly told me they were closed
i paid 35 for a gel
was a bit disappointed
a i love this place
they do excellent threading and they did a very good job with my pedicure
she is super gentle and informative
when i arrived marianne led me into the room and gave me a visual evaluation as i undressed
from brows to brazilians and everything in between they are the best
when driving in from la is the the first hotel you see
the only time that ive ever had a painless waxing experience and it was amazing
i met bryan who turned out to also be a very good therapist  if you like strong pressure in all the right points
my mom has been coming to andy and brian for over 7 years now and always raved to me about them to me
cherry lash lounge high prices cheap quality i guess they dont understand the expression you get what you pay for
plan on returning in the next few weeks to have my other tragus pierced
i asked the lady standing there what the difference in them was
evolution hair center as well as william has brought me back to life as well as my hair
yes  the next day
neither were warm or personable
kommt man erstmal in den gemtlichen behandlungsraum sorgen sowohl die freundlichen thailndischen damen wie auch dekoration und dezente beleuchtung fr wohlgefuehl
i didnt have any complaints when i was regularly coming here to tan membership prices arent bad and i always showed up before the line ever got crazy long
include this in your budget make it work
okay now the important stuff
as a nongamer and nonsmoker vdara was perfect
in my dozen or so appointments everything has always healed up
this is my barber shop in the valley from now on and i am glad that their location is an easy walk from my house
never will return again
i will tell everyone i see to not use this location
a friend of mine recommended chrissy and i am forever in her debt
i love staying at the four seasons or st regis properties so when i booked my first appointment online which was super easy to do  i didnt know what to expect from a standalone facility
i am very disappointed this is how the award wining spa service
my first experience with phx laser  rejuvenation center was overall great
just went to my usual nail spot on the way home from work and walked in to a line out the door
now i know this doesnt exempt the barber shop from any and all claims of racism but i havent experienced it myself at this shop anyway
rachel was so great the spa facial she gave me made a huge difference in my acne prone skin
after we sat down in the chair he did an assessment
i still have cuticles that are all uneven random strands of skin sticking out of my nails they didnt file or buffer my nails etc
i appreciate my therapists for all they do to fix me while they risk their bodies for my piece of heavenly relief
the lattes were awesome and there was popcorn too
i bought a groupon through her and booked the appointment in advance she waited for it to pass didnt call me or text me at all not even as she was waiting and waiting for two hours and now wants to charge me double as in 97 to make an appointment
they did a good job though
this is my new go to spray place
however for the price i was expecting an amazing haircut from really knowledgeable staff
dude it is the end of summer i told you a few times about my young children and how i am excited to get out of the house for the first time and i know they are dry and callousedthats why i am here
the sign is posted for 8
but cuts were excellent
i was in and out within 2030 mins of having a full set of nails done
giuliana is the best
even if they have no problem discussing their private life in front of clients i sure have a problem hearing it
my next session is scheduled for may 12th
still dont feel well after eating that
definitely 5 stars
the actual treatments seem to work so far
only the best from these ladies
cuticles look terrible and poor job polishing as well
we ended our stay with an amazing breakfast at the fireskys restaurantgreat food and solid bloody marys
instead theyre busy chatting up a storm among themselves and their clients just like youd see in barber shop style movies which always makes for a great time
we reserved a solitaire suite and when we checked in they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a princess suite which was sweet
i wouldnt become a regular but if definitely come back if i were running errands around here
i went for an acne problem and ended up with a very high hormone problem from taking their prescribed antibiotics for too long mistakes happen right
its as easy as 1 2 3 1  call text or book online
first of all i liked her energy immediately
nikki is such a nice lady she made my sister and i feel comfortable right away
when quoted at the front for a pedicure 45 i didnt realize that it is for just a basic gel polish change and no callous removal or foot scrub  thats extra
this is the best nail place ive ever been to this is my go too spot
it was about 20 minutes
i was very curious why the place only has 3 stars review
my daughters second time here and luna did yet another amazing job
clean rooms by the way and i felt like i was at a luxury spa wish there was a little bit more soothing music but ntl my experience and consultations were the best
definitely wont regret seeing her
she offers great advice on products how to apply and when
imagine not having to stress about your wedding day makeup and hair at all
i highly recommend cherry lash lounge
my barber is marco always punctual
hes an older exmarine with more stories than you can listen to in a lifetime
great onsite dining
step it up
then when youre done you can get up and get that big plastic thing out of your mouth along with all the drool that will definitely be pulled out with it
its really cheap
and i felt the stiffness
i definitely had better haircuts in my life for cheaper
firstly i told the manicurist to cut my cuticles
think moisturizers make your skin break out
the pictures was all from today 30 minutes after i got home
the bartender was my best experience
the day i checked in the shower had a few hairs leftright at the height of the shower head
i explained this to the women at the front assuming the owner and she could have cared less
it also makes it much easier to want to get the f outta there
this was not the case here as there was shaving cream all over the walls of the shower hair on the floor dust in the lockers debris on the carpet in the locker room
she asked all about me and matched me with the best fit
will never return
only one star for their hours of operation
first of all the salon is beautiful what a gorgeous new and clean salon
ive never had to wait more than a few minutes and my nails always look perfect
office is very clean many product available for purchase and water for ones thirst
his customer service was great
i wanted a gel manicure and as w were getting closer to finishing she showed me that the new brand of gel polish they had just ordered gelaze was runny and not drying right
kate is an incredible artist no matter what the occasion is this woman can execute it flawlessly
will never come back who knows what they are putting into the polish
this was very efficient not very spa  like  relaxing but i wanted to be in and out anyway
they look great
angie lum is everything a girl would want from a makeup artist she is professional talented efficient and she is a fantastic conversationalist
prices arent as high as i thought they could be for the area
and i really hate to ask other people to spend money on long distance calls when it can be avoided
she did great
i got a tattoo with anthony had a blast  all the guys in the shop are super cool i would recommend coming here
their prices are very reasonable and the salon is super clean
parking is usually easy to find and prices arent bad either
she  takes into consideration my hair goals and talks me through the process so i fully understand whats going on
on a side note i am in sales so i understand up selling but really everything costs more money
he even made a few adjustments and said were going to grow this out so we can make it more angular  which is exactly what i want someone who makes me look good
every time we set foot in that elevator it was hot
since i got such an unwelcomed vibe for whatever reason glad i did not give them business
today was my first time here and i loved it
thank you to the students who do better work than the professionals out there
i dont mind paying for quality but seriously you cant even say you received a good massage on the chairs
other than the staff being very friendly the services are no good
book with dessa
i do not recommend this place
the suite is dilapidated and they dont offer any creature comforts not even a towel to rest your feet on for the pedicure just the hard plastic
the studio itself is really well kept clean  bright
she is also certified as a chef
original review unedited first time floating here are my thoughts the place is just clean enough  it doesnt really look or feel like a spa but more like a warehouse with some decorations and float tanks in rooms kindve a weird hippy vibe dont know how else to describe it other than justweird
i would like to review a great spa experience i had here recently
at amazing lash studio i nap blissfully during my refills
i hate having my photo taken but wanted to include a photo of how great my hair looks anyway
after learning that dr hess would no longer be doing the injections i left a very unsatisfied customer
this is the best investment i make in my beauty routine
he promotes women keeping their length too
highly recommend these guys
the staff was very friendly and greeted me well amy was very sweet and honest about what procedures i should consider for my acne scarring
when i arrived the british woman told me he wasnt there and to have a seat
its my new nail place from now on
this place is one of the coolest most hip boutique hotels i have ever stayed at
and they brink drinks to you
so why did you sit me with her
i had wasted time and money
i got the exact tone of blonde i wanted and the results look incredibly natural
i have acneprone skin and couldnt get a facial wax without breaking out everywhere the next day sometimes the same day until i came to this place
kim the owner was very friendly and gave me some free nail wheels to practice on
jerry made me feel very comfortable  most importantly  left feeling so relaxed
i saw their add on groupon and wanted to buy it
he was great  he was ready for me when i arrived very personable and put me at ease despite my nervousness
i recommend it
what a great place
discount rate minus 5
i changed me mind on colors  without a problem she did what i asked
she did side swept and to be honest ive never got my bangs to look so good with so little maintenance
this is an inexpensive and effective place
it is amazing to me how some people dont care about customer service it is all about money
afterward we head back down to the first level and rinse off
needs to be better organized thats for sure
big chaise lounges separated by sheer curtains for privacy little reading lights and a spot for your beverage
was in town on business and stopped in for a haircut
qua delivered and more
if you are looking for great cut color or style thats new or same ol
i love spending my time and money at dolce
this is my new nail salon
i am especially happy with the new look of the nail salon
i came here to get my makeup and hair done for my graduation
the cut and style was exactly what i asked for
would highly recommend
she was quick and did an amazing job
however not so sure about the haircuts here though
we always go to amazing cuts becausw its just right by us
i walk away completely satisfied with the results
my brows have found a new home
well nikkie did not write down my appointment in her book
its a nice botanical atmosphere with fireplaces and fountains throughout and the staff are quick to please
do not go here to get gels removed if from a different place
i picked out my color and it was amazing how it turned out on me
ive been to shila at least six times now because she is extremely thorough and pays close attention to detail
ive been doing my laser hair treatments  touchups since 2007 and this has been one of the best investments i could have ever made
an hour each way to see her and i wouldnt have it any other way
hes amazing i love the cut and how he styled my hair like a victoria secret model
i highly recommend her
i took my shoes off and walked around to unpack my stuff and literally 10 minutes later my bf comments on how black my feet are and i know my feet wasnt black from anything else
that should have been my first clue
so happy i found them and dominique especially  highly recommended
we had to leave out and drive 10 miles to go wash we can not figure why are carpet is soakedhousekeeping kept saying that we had a dnd do not disturb sign on the door
she was incredibly gentle the whole time making sure i was comfortable
no tugging on my lashes
im new to east mesa gilbert and i went to 2 places since moving back and they didnt do a very good job kims nails  lotus nails i came to sunset hoping itd be my new nail spot and wow
the people are very nice but the man who was there made the lady wait 15 minutes then complained she was there late
i found wax on wax off on groupon which by the way is an excellent price
he gives me tips on my hair makes me feel comfortable and best of all his prices are extremely affordable
when you walk into some salons it smells like the staff just got done having an aerosol spray can fight
why am i paying for a service that has no regard to the client paying
my appointment today was at 915 and i went back around 930 and left the salon around 1130  this is longer than it has taken me at other aveda institutes but i didnt mind since i had the time and was expecting it to take a bit
the top of my head looks like a deformity because this person was not paying attention and did not take the time to provide great customer service
dont waste your time and money
not sure if i can do without anymore
my pedicures always last for a month at least
i was seen right away it was midday on a thursday so it wasnt busy
our room had two double beds which felt quite small  next time ill opt for the king room
every customer counts except at this facility
also my sister came in same day to get a deep conditioning treatment and her hair feels like silk as does mine considering how many chemicals were placed on it i was surprised when jessie my stylist messaged me afterwards to talk about my hair and asked if i liked it and even thanked me for being patient with her as she took 6 hours on my hair
have been there three times
i would definitely go back to her again not because of her charming personality which i didnt see much of but because she does a damn good job
ill never go back
might have been heat from the windows
finally found my stylist in phoenix
thank you celebrity tanning for reaching out and making things right by refunding my available balance
lana and her team are very professional and clean
i have been coming to jane for 3 months now for both acrylic nails and gel pedis and have been extremely happy every time
this has been the most awful spa experience to date especially given the 110 price and they couldnt even get things right and clean my face properly
i left there so upset to the point of tears
i definitely recommend this place
i had an appointment and it was right on time
i called on monday as i didnt have time to go back before and they told me to send a photo which i did straight away
they do a really good and thorough job in shampooing your hair
i like that fact she will come to you and leave you in a peaceful place
my husband said that is was one of the best massages hes ever had
it was a nice leg massage compared to some of the other places where they just gently rub your legs
a fortunate and unexpected find
i am a non smoker and very sensitive to it but was never bothered as i played
it totally shocked me that she remembered my name after being in only once
they made her day which makes my day
it is perfect
thank you girl for making me look like a million bucks again
i ended up choosing a great opi gel color something to do with herring they also had the matching opi regular polish for my toes
ive never in my life had an experience that bad
she really made me feel comfortable and i loved the products she used in my hair my hair smelled amazing
its all way darker and brown
i loved the open feeling with the windows lining the front wall and the decor was very modern yet chic
i wasnt nervous
massage id never experienced a hot stone massage before and it was excellent
i went back to salon and claudia greeted me
staffs great everyone with smiles
they could be the technicians or the trainer or they are simply the customers who want to go back and show appreciation to the facility
excited to go back
blair is the one to go to for permanent hair removal
since then ive tried a bunch of the downtown salons homecuts student cuts you name it done it all
i was so relaxed i fell asleep a few times
from cheap as can be chinatown to average priced korea town to much pricier salons downtown and even laval
this review is based on the customer service because my amazing aesthetician lauren just left
we had a mishap with scheduling for a bridal party and were panicking about getting our hair done the morning of the wedding
i love this place
i was  glad to see they are open on sundays
when i showed up for my appointment
this was my first time at minibarbershop and my experience was bad to say the least
they take their time and you never feel rushed
to dr mundt and your staff i want to say thank you
also not all my nails are the same length
by the 3rd visit i could walk unassisted and open my eyes properly
this review may come across harsh but pittsburgh has a lot of really good restaurants so if you wanna compete you have to be on top of your game
your first thai massage with bahn thai spa traditional thai massage and wellness centre
now she just made it all dark brown  while blow drying my hair she burnt me three or four times
i grit my teeth as i walked up to the front desk to check out i paid the required 10 tip per the gift certificate and stormed out
if youre on vacation save yourself the time and hassle
liz was working alone because the owner was away on business
afterwards we headed offsite for dinner returned to check out sunset pointe and then retired to our room for the night
tracy is the owner of the salon and its clear why
definitely wont recommend them to my lashwearing friends
she did a great job and ill totally be finishing my treatments with her
if you are going to charge 200300 for services the amenities included should be top notch
chris and she informed me that there was no refund they would put them back on for free or take them off for free
i would definitely recommend her
it came with a whole kitchen the buildings used to be livein tenant
i went for a shellac mani and a regular pedi
nice nail salon
im so happy i found them and will be going back for any skin care needs i have
she even said if i gave it a few days and wanted more layers in the front to come back and she would do it free of charge
my thick hair was in dire need of some love and tamingso i decided to give seefu salon on spadina a chance
he is great guy too
i say ohhh yes
in addition i asked how prinitng it out would help prevent people from using the same coupon twice they could after all print the same coupon twice
2 the therapist called left a voice message then sent a bunch of text messages a few days after my original review
this location is big and spacious but a bit out of the way
it is a super oily hawaiian technique that involves long massage strokes
to top it off we had two huge roaches in our room the last night which made sleep uneasy our last night there
actually everyone here is so friendly i feel like im going to visit family
dont get me wrong all of them are lovely ladies and i like them personally but i believe they should have let me known by phone that they changed it to another person
julie took her time doing my nails to make sure they were perfect
i have a pretty strong pain tolerance so i wouldnt have even been here if my pain level wasnt at least a 7810
dana and deb are the best i have found in the greater pittsburgh area
ive been here a few times the most recent time was to get stuff for my last minute halloween costume
so right before christmas i had to see some other guy who quite frankly did a crappy job
even though it wasnt my money spent money is money and this nail shop was the most wasteful place to spend it on
i will certainly be returning
the receptionists are very friendly but most of the staff seem very inexperienced
i adressed my dissapointment to the guy who seemed to be in charge
but convenience and quality trumps price with this place
everytime we went somewhere we had to cab it
rude uncaring and appeared irritated when i asked a question
needless to say i will never go there for hair again and unfortunately i cant remember the stylists name or i would certainly divulge it
i highly recommend stacey as she understands how the body functions and how to get you back on track
when she started using the electric razor my daughter started occasionally jerking her head and the lady was getting very short with her saying stay still it only tickles
also what kind of burger restaurant does not cook their burgers to order
saw dr mitchell today for a consult and really liked him and his staff they were super nice and helpful and fully explained everything for me
looking at my before pictures they have really helped me clear up skin
first of all i called very last minute to see about an appointment
its nice to be able to go in and get a professional haircut and not feel like you are wasting the stylists time
the hot stone pedicure is heavenly
she did a great job was fast and a delight to talk to
my ouchy knee feels better  i slept for 10 hours still got up twice for the bathroomim 63
the place was so busy
i would soooo recommend him you want to get amazing color go see doctor blonde
this place is great i always go back
it was less painful than expected
its private and quiet
they are so nice and hospitable
if the guys come you know its good
so happy that i found this place
this is by far that spot
they are fast and polite
they have a sign that says how much you should tip
the manicurist worked quickly and diligently on my hands giving me a quick massage and really going at my cuticles with full force
he cut my 3 year olds hair today which is not the easiest task in the world but he rocked it and my little dude looks more handsome than ever
do yourself a favor and use simplicity insteadtheir lasers do not come into contact with skin and are much more efficient then deserets
so it took twice as long and my hair took twice as much chemicals as they had to redo the color
just dont try to get my preset appointments
its 2 weeks later and i have no cracks or peeling like the last one i got
he said that was impossible because they only give one parking pass per reservation
with most threading places you dont make an appointment because it is usually a quick service
i was impressed by this salon before i ever went in
i was so excited to have this lovely relaxing morning getting my nails done and yet i look back and the atmosphere alone left me uncomfortable feeling unappreciated as a customer price gouged may be the best phrase and wondering why this excessive cost was acceptable
i confirmed the price 3 times reiterating it would not cost more than than 49
with all the choices in las vegas i suggest picking a different place
a few years ago i went on a mission to find a new barber
i had my daughter with me and normally she sits with me while i get my nails done but this place actually had a child chair
grace is the one in suite one
i could not have been happier that i chose amelia c for my perfect day
just because your head is lopsided does not mean you cant look sexay
i decided to go do groceries in the meantime and came back an hour later id asked if this was ok and they took me immediately
even if i have to wait for the free weights
second word kat
after my second time at nailsense im still very satisfied  my french manicure and pedi last about two to three weeks without chipping
obviously this salon is established and they can take or leave whoever they want so just be prepared to not get an appointment
the facility is huge and impressive
my piercer was named tyson and i honestly could not have hoped for a better person to do my body piercing
i asked her if there was someone there who might be familiar with the product and could help over the phone because im going out of town in the morning i wont be able to get back to the store for another 3 weeks
beware the owner has a horrible attitude and is extremely rude
he respected that
phil closed his shop in queens ny and opened this one
the lashes i got dont compare to how lovely lashes does their work
space offers ample sitting and entertaining while you wait
second visit with an appointment there was still a wait
i have been going to the 702 nail lounge for quite some time now and i have to say that all of the techs do an excellent job
this was the best possible setup and it made it very easy for the three of us to get ready in the mornings
my family and i have been coming here for over 10 years
just had my first session he was very knowledgeable and helpful with making the decision to go forward with laser tattoo removal
chuck is a very kind man and really cares about his clients
she evaluated my needs and started work and two hours later absolutely amazing
and brutally brushed my poor hair
i spent over a year trying to get what i found with shelby rae
she explained what a swedish massage was and her words were it is a light to medium pressure full body massage
maybe its because i went with a groupon but why are you going to have a groupon if youre going to get bothered that people are going to use a coupon but hey i guess you get what you pay for ill never come here again
took care of my kids while i sat with my feet soaking for 20 minutes
70 for a full set wide coffin ombr gel set which i absolutely love and will definitely return for the work that was displayed ive tried the wide coffin often and havent been very satisfied
i have a pretty active lifestyle and anytime i get aches pains or sports related injuries the first thing i do is go see dr downs
this store is always clean the everything is always presented well
i will see if at the end of this post if they remove it each time for sanitation i suspect they dont since it was somewhat wet
the philip pelusi on murray might yet be good for spa treatments and waxes i havent tried either of those
i even had some waxing done and thats where the problems are for me
she colored and cut my hair and it was all for a reasonable price
today i found a groupon now deal for a haircut at r salon
i told her that i wanted a blowout but nothing super straight no flat iron except for my bangs and hairline where i tend to have frizz
summer and her team do a great job
they did tell me they assigned me a therapist that doesnt go deep more medium but this wasnt even medium more a rub like how you put lotion on yourself
i bought the antiaging line and plan to purchase more products
she was on her phone the whole time
now as she dried my hair she dried it straight up
if you cant manage to relax and unwind here there is something seriously wrong with you
the ladies are very nice and free massage after 10th one
also really sweet
the price is amazing for the service you receive and it only took a few minutes for her to reshape and clean up my eyebrows
we decided to be brave and not make an appointment  how busy could the place be at 100 on a friday afternoon
theres also so pretty nice restaurants around this area
the first thing he does is cut all my hair down to 1 inch
i felt like instead of being a customer that they service that i was a giant inconvenience to them
come to find out the lady who answered the phone wasnt even on site
she was stressed and people left due to the long wait
do not i repeat do not go here if your hair matters to you
i have long curly sometimes unruly hair and tony is the only one that can cut and style it perfectly
she preceded to maniacally dry cut harsh blunt layers into my hair
its a nice resort but just didnt feel that the service matched the expense in many areas
this place is fantastic
i didnt need the small comments  lol
bon choix de vernis et personnel professionnels
alessandra was professional and courteous and the appointment went by quickly and efficiently
i felt very welcomed the second i walked in
she aims to please
so i patiently waited  waited
he he he anywho this place is all that and a buscuit
he knew how important it was to me and he nailed it
very happy with results
the first time it was a bit of a mess
this is a beauty haven  a treasure to have in the city
i couldnt be happier with her artistic ability and service
want to take a quick moment and thank you all for coming checking out my page
the salon is very professional and clean and kim did a perfect job for me
love it here great beds
as always autum crushes
went in for the first time today for an eyebrow and lip wax
i specifically told her not to cut the top well guess what thats the first thing she did
just moved to the area  found this place wow
monday rolls around and no refund
they were very nice  told me to come in the next weekend  they would do it again for free
i assume the hotel occupancy was lower on tuesday compared to wednesday
i would highly recommend this salonand tomto anyone wanting perfect nails and a good experience
i have friends that have worked at nail salons and tell me of the horror stories if things arent cleaned right
their location is great the price is awesome and they have a monthly plan that is affordable
fit me in
shes very sweet and super gentle while shes working
it wouldnt be an issue if you speak mandarin of course but alas i do not
definitely wont be back
i asked her to stop and she said ingrown nail and kept picking
filthy tanning beds snarky immature employees will never come back
no callus file that looks like a cheese grader
i had the studio suite at a killer rate of 95 a night
rounding out the impeccable team was tyler with both hairmakeup and again i could not have been more impressed
being in sales its important to make a customer feel like they are important
we had to attend a function at convention center and also squeeze in a job interview at a local hospital
high praises from all three of us
the place smells wonderful
each time ive left disappointed
they have to move on to their next client after all
i have never see a tanning place where it is ran by meatheads high pressuring you in buying stuff
but in this case you cant lose at this salon
we needed a pharmacy after most were closed and found this one
it was wonderful
the health benefits are amazing
our stay was 7 nights
it was difficult to tell the tech not to cut the cuticles due to the language barrier so i let him continue against my better judgment
then i get home and find my heels look as though they hadnt been touched in years despite being a regular here
i wanted to celebrate my new job starting on monday so thought i would treat myself to a complete spa day
we met with samantha who not only took the time to discuss the best options for my mom but seemed to really listen and care about my moms hair style desires
was here in tempe on vacation and found lora via yelp
after the waxing is done she also fills in the brows if you need it
then as i was about to walk into the room i started a conversation with another employee and she informed me that they do not even have level 1 beds
also very convenient for them to keep lotions in a plastic baggy in a secure room did you know that when exposed to heat lotions will break down and stop working that stuff is way to expensive to be destroying
it was amazing
everyone who works there is so friendly and fun and the salon itself is beautiful
i let her create her own designs
dr lees results are the most natural looking ive ever seen
pros  beautifully designed salon   extremely friendly staff cons  tried already 2 hairstylists to give the place a chance and was disappointed both times  nothing exceptional here   when i ask for a trim i dont expect more than an inch to be cut off
in that situation my hair looked like a nest and didnt look good at all this following day
no one says anything to me but the receptionist who then says due to a booking error we will have to reschedule your appointment i told him i drove 45 minutes to the salon and had already been rebooked and given the run around and this is third rebook now in addition my husband is waiting with my kids
in the bathrooms and showers we found tons of cool products like great smelling shampoos and conditioners lotions face cleaner and mouthwash
i have yet to have a bad experience at this barber shop
im already self conscious and now my hair looks like a crusty sponge
i went in for a pedicure and left disappointed
i have been getting my hair cut here with my mom since i was a kid
its just beautiful absolutely beautiful
when she washed my hair the shampoo and conditioner were tailored for my hair type a small detail that didnt go unnoticed
probably less variance playing on the strip during the weekends but i mainly come for the fun
i dropped in on a recent trip to phoenix for a 730 pm class and thought this was a great studio
i have been going to julia for waxing and facials for 6 months now and i will never go anywhere else
oh it was horrible
las vegas can be overwhelming since all the hotels and casinos have over the top spas
i would not go again
i went on the website and got the email to the salon to express my distress in hopes that someone would forward it to the manager or owner
i wanted to inform you that i had a few issues regarding the services provided
you can go to anyone of his team members and they will give you the kelly experience
brian is a perfectionist
i will never come back here
you can compare prices
i will be coming back
john did a great job
i was a little anxious to have the one procedure done as it was larger than previous incisions ive had
she asked questions about pressure temperature etc which i really appreciated since i have had several massage therapists who do not ask this question
um first hes 15 i dont really want a 15 year old boy touching my legs
i am not arguing that i like my hair im arguing that the gift card is being refused
i was waited on immediately which is a big plus to begin with
i will never go to another hair salon again
went here for a bridal party hair appt
the canyon ranch has water
valte guys are niceeveryone was professional
i was scheduled to see lauren
my mother came in at 420 am and asked her to come back tomorrow at 930 am
it seriously looked like a little kid did it
i checked in without my mom and the next day i was informed i need to submit full payment for the room asap
ive been going to roger for years
their sandals are really comfortable and the robes are great
i got so many compliments on my shorter do and was amazed at how with their coaching i was able to get so much more curl out of my naturally wavy locks
as a guy who typically visits high priced salons for a haircut i was pleasantly surprised and happy with the cut i received from simon
i had a massage slated for 4pm and i arrived like they told me at 330pm for checkin
she aisha did an amazing job
it does not make sense to me to pay 50 a month for a free massage and discounts
horrible horrible customer service
fabulous so cancel it now
i didnt have to wait which was great because i didnt have an appointment
i wouldnt go here again
i had a root touch up and cut and she listened and did exactly what i needed
random walk in for a hair cut with successful results
this place is so welcoming and the shop itself is very cool
and then i had all my hair chopped off at a hair show last november leaving me feeling like a boy and ashley added some extensions and helped me feel pretty again
a couple weeks ago my buddys fiance who is an amazing chiropractor adjusted me and felt a hard knot in my lower back
she took me back to the wash house and stripped the toner down a notch and brightened the ends up more
this was hands down the best hair washhead massage ive ever had
the owner double booked my first appointment so after arriving she told me id have to reschedule
the trainers here dont rely on machine circuits like many other gyms
we are locals sort of
didnt expect to see them still open
i dont want you as a patient if you are going to take other doctors advice
i read the yelp reviews and then called her to get a lash tint
make sure you bring a check or cash with you because they dont accept cards because they are such a small place
my kids go there all the time
lesson finally learned
all my future trips to vegas will be booked at the m
she is perfectionist personable very professional
then they instituted a fee to use the pool area with no credit for using the bar and food service
the tables being made of material are not sanitary and cant  be wiped down between people
i booked a regular room but requested a view of the bellagio fountains and i was upgraded to one
i go to them every week
i am so happy did
thank you reset
pleased with stay
always offers my kids candy even if they arent getting haircuts
i cant really write a review because i never took advantage of their services
the staff was so nice
new to the area so used yelp for the first time to find a stylist
i was immediately greeted and informed of macs new limited edition line
if i could give this review more stars trust me i would
cant get better than willie or his staff at farm and durango
this place is right accross the street from sls casino in the same parking lot as the iconic mcdonalds and convenient 711
not a fan of misleading advertising
i felt gorgeous
best part is she only charged me for just a regular pedicure
anyone looking for a nice cut this is your place
they also checked to make sure my daily routine is working including confirming that the shades i use still fit my skin tone
great water pressure toiletries were ample
the lockers look plain the rugs are plain there arent any candles flowers plants special touches everything is totally neutral colored the whole thing is boring and feels like a bad locker room
thanks again kelly
ahhh this is the life
its all of that manual labor  you gotta treatyoself
i will definitely be going back soon
i recommend this place to everyone
i would pay for a cut and highlight color 100125 now it is 160200
the space is absolutely beautiful every color and detail flows to create a perfect launching and landing pad for the bath
i asked her again and she insisted that i didnt need to
my face felt congested and tired
i had never been to lavida but they had a coupon on google and well i like coupons
she didnt see my point and continued to try to make her point across
being a lover of hash browns i asked whether it was possible to get some but unfortunately the kitchen didnt have any
he had a crack in one of his toenails soccer player problems and they glued it for him
just had a great experience here
the entire experience was wonderful
dont go anywhere else
will definitely go back next time
then a customer said he had been going to a great clips near him for several years and he was happy
it isnt painful and the results are amazing
there is an hourly fee 4 hour minimum and a minimum for spa services which needs to be hit but the second part is easy enough with three or more
its not something i would normally expect but i am thrilled nonetheless
i had a really good experience
great guy great family great atmosphere and if you need a beer they have a fridge with refreshments while you wait
he was very cold and extremely rude
definitely check it out you will not be disappointed
gina greco is a hair stylist at euphoria who did my color and extensions for many years
when we finally got seated i thought they would start on our pedicure but again it took them awhile to get to us
i feel incredible after each visit
i was a walkin customer and got seated within about 5 minutes of my walking through the door
not a good experience and will not go back there again for that
all these other places are trying to upsell you on callus remover and exfoliater crap but moon gives you a full hour including callus removing exfoliation with massage and then massage with lotion as well she  takes pride in her work and saved me all throughout my pregnancy when my feet were a wreck
i just dont know  for what
jane is rude and questions my stylist every move on my hair then finally agrees to do it
i get my brows done all the time so i know what they look like
trisha is extremely professional and thoroughly covers all procedures before beginning treatment
dr hozjan was great at understanding my medical history at the same time explaining everything he was doing during examination and then the supplement recommendation for nutritional healing
im usually pretty reluctant to go to the doctor too often but everyone at this facility made the whole process so painless and they really seemed to care
anyway do yourself a favor and check out nohea nails
he eventually talked me into no more acrylic and just starting fresh with the gel polish
in depth review we did an overnight staycation so we could enjoy the red rock pool on sunday july 26th before heading back to work on monday
after paying 70 i shouldnt be left trying to fix things
im nit a huge fan of vegas but i sure am of teryn and ill totally be flying back out in two years to get a little bolder work done cause im more me after she did my eye work
the change in rooms was day and night
he also told me that he didnt want someone with an atittude in his salon ruining the energy
at the end of all of this i was appalled and emotional about the way each of the employees handled their business and the way they treated me as a customer
she can barely get a sentence out and her comments are all over the lace
they nail technicians here are so talented the designs they freehand are so cool no one would even believe they did those
when she was finally done she still didnt even say hello
the little things go a long way
if they have reopened i will definitely return here on my next yearly trip
wonderful staff that listened to my wants and concerns
one of the cleanest establishments i have been to
and i am vietnamese
she was willing to use one of her guest passes that she pays for to allow me into the club
within 2 days my nails started to split and tear
this location is a little over a year old and has the clinic section i have gotten flu shots here last year and also this year both times were simple and quick
1 star is generous for the hotel
environment is friendly
visited here recently for the photo center and the quality of prints was horrendous and they kill you on copyright paperwork
i went in the other day for a fill
so so for a top tier hotel
regardless of the mascara issues this is still an awesome store and i will definitely go back the next time im in vegas
my first experience at belly bliss was called lighten up 30minute quickie session on my lunch hour that focused on my feet and legs
they left her a note that she never received since she had back to back appts
clearly a daily audit isnt done otherwise a 500 boost in daily revenue would have been noticed
the salon was nice and the service was great
got a bacterial pink eye infection that was verified from my dr being bacterial not allergic reaction in both eyes from here and never an apology or compensation was offered
for 17 i want a great manicure that can do better than myself
enjoyed our visit at vintage suds
if i had not trusted in nurse amys recommendations i would have been so disappointed
i understand mistakes can be made and im glad the situation has been treated correctly
as matter of fact i didnt even know my hair could look that awful
i gave her 20 tip at the end but did not seem to appreciate it
the salon is super cute and everyone is so friendly
everyone is very nice and friendly and polite i do recommend this nail place to anyone if you are looking
ive been here a handful times now since the switch
i again let her know she sighed loudly and adjusted it
i went back because i want to like this place
i was wearing my watch and after a few minutes out of curiosity i timed her
ive known her for a couple of years and was so excited to see that she was branching off on her own
let them know and they will push the chair up for you
i decided to make use of the loot bags to send home with the girls and it made it so much easier and the kids loves them
plus if youre looking for a nifty tea pot or accessory they have em
it didnt put me into labour but for 30 she took her time and didnt rush me even tho i was 20 min late  parking sucks there and she stayed open for me
i found this nail salon on yelp and decided to try it a few months ago i havent regret my decision
fehler behoben zu bekommen musste ich nochmals 35eur draufzahlen was zu einem stolzen gesamtpreis von 180 eur fhrte
feels like im staying in park inn hotel here
here i am 2 months later after many hours therapy and tears finally writing this reviewkiddingbut it did suck as a new transplant to the area i had no idea where to go to get a good highlight and trim
the day before so i am glad i followed up
i have been nothing but happy with both my pedicures
the deluxe pedicure is worth the extra money
actions speak louder than words and when i saw all
i have tried her designs as well and she does a very neat job
the first time i got my hair cut from this location i was pleased missy actually took the time to learn about the haircut i actually wanted  i was so happy
she did a good trim for hair
overall good experience
like seriouslydoes it get much better
their customer service definitely makes me a repeat customer
i highly recommend osole for their sopranoxl
she is very patient and receptive to her clients demands
please also clean your stations it looks like a chinese factory in there so dirty and disorganized i have never felt relaxed in there like a nail salonspa should feel dont waste your money people their nail work is hideous and so is their service waaaaay overpriced for the low quality and products
i walked out looking like ebony man of the month
love this place
although my service was only 2530 mins she made it feel like a relaxing hour
well he rang everything up which came out to 13700 in returns so i was going to just do a even exchange for that
there was no wait when i came in but as with all no appointment salon several people came in after i arrived so they did wait for a few minutes there were 2 stylists working so things went pretty fast
i really just love the friendliness that excludes from this place you definitely dont get that at all salons
i left at 8 pm
jamie who i was scheduled with at the bookers recommendation is a cheerful and laidback gal with tats and a wicked custommade leather tool kit
shout outs to tuff
it was my second sugar brazilian wax and the whole process was quick pretty painless and i felt comfortable the whole time
it was the first time with her but she did such a fantastic job im going to request her in the future
so what a relief that parlour despite being on the trendy ossington strip manages to be both trendy and friendly  the best combination
regardless it always turns out amazing
i have recommended them to several friends based on my positive experience
i am also thinking of having infini come to our office for a thank you to our staff
madison asked me why i didnt want them i said i changed my mind
ive had a good haircut here and two bad ones
armando was excellent he knew exactly how to treat the pain i was experiencing
its in the basement of an office building and the inside of the building is beautiful
i get up to use the bathroom and there is a huge 3 inch roach in the bathroom running all over
the manicure and pedicure were a nightmare
when itchy hair got on his neck she took a cool quiet hair dryer to blow the hairs away
the salon also has a huge selection of gel nail polish colors to choose from
it reminds me of my mom the good old days as a teenager at home having her buy me the products
that way the tech can help you find the closest match
i have been there and thoroughly enjoyed a great massage by sol
ditto the rest of their products
instead of talking to a coworker or the typical do you have an ulta card
however i felt that the associates working here were very salesy
he responded very quickly excited about my ideas
but the girls i do believe switch up salon from time to time
if you are looking for a portrait you cant go wrong with having joe do it
do not to to marshall
he told me my regular french is boring
steve had me out the chair within 30 minutes
the only reason i visited this place is because i got a coupon online
i went in for an advertised 18 30 minute reflexology masage and not only did they keep trying to upsell to a 60 minute body massage and acted like they didnt understand english when i said no just 30 minute reflexology literally 5 times the maseuss also called in the manager who i had to tell another 3 times no just 30 minute reflexology
bare minerals has been the best makeup ive used
needless to say i think my stylist and i have fallen into a rut complacent with the way things are going even if they arent to my satisfactioneven if i complain a bit and it doesnt get acknowledged appropriately
some of the staff are super friendly some not so much
once she finally got to me she seemed to be in a rush
i cannot express how pleased i am with the work jorge does
i kept getting that cut until yesterday when i asked her to cut it shorter
its lumpy and uneven on my big toes
check out their updated and expanded product selection where you can get everything you could possibly need to continue to spoil yourself at home in between appointments
then theres this grand space with 34 tubs built high on a cemented pyramid as the water overflows over each level with colored lights highlighting the mini waterfalls
in and out with no bs
although it was my first tattoo i did unfortunately pass out twice during it
he takes his time to really figure out what you want
1 i consider this place overpriced
given theyre good a what they do they sometimes are super busy
if you looking for someone who cares about what hes putting on your body look no further
the grounds were impeccable
will take you completelu in the wrong direction and then ask you for 75 when you finally redirect him to the right location
its not just her though
aber die preise sind schon recht ambitioniert 2 erwachsene und zwei kids schlagen mit knapp 50 zu buche
he is polite and has a clean shop
mondays and tuesdays there are specials and online you can get a printable coupon
if you cant afford a gym such as 24 hr fitness and crossfit gyms then pf or golds gym would be the best recommendation but they really can use more free weights  i think pf kinda caters more to those that focus on cardio which is fine if you are trying to lose some weight
my lashes lasted abut 2 to 3 weeks
when i ask for a gel polish change they dont do that great of a job as they would if you were to get a full gel manicure
this is my first time getting them and was quite nervous about it but im so glad i decided to go for it
will always highly recommend them to every groomer i know
because i have never left this place unsatisfied i have fully neglected waxing and have converted to threading
the waverly is quite a drive for me but its worth it to have such a great stylist
its hard to find those booths in general
what horrible customer service
i spent the time before my treatment hanging out in the whirlpools sauna and steam room
on the other hand my daughter had this other lady
lucky for me i was never allowed to touch my eyebrows my mother forbid it so i never fell victim to those parenthesiscomma eyebrows of the early 90s
my neck is a challenge because of an old injury and she zeroed in identifying the problem areas right away
next time i went to get my haircut my hairdresser said that the shampoo i ended up purchasing was definitely not what i needed for my hair type and hairstyle
best  eyelashes in town and all the technicianbl are awesome
had juvederm and dysport done several months ago with nanette and couldnt be happier
never been disappointed and the place is gorgeous
i felt that in the 50 mins i was there she repeated the same process over  over
i then told her that the misunderstanding of information was not an issue that what was the issue was her lack of empathy for us and that she was rude
explain to me how a company has a 100 satisfaction guarantee policy if you cant open and try the product
the shop was super clean and i liked the fact that she took great care to make sure that there was no cross contamination
i gave up on gelish after
i dont know what others preference is but thats a 5star for me
deana is amazing
dont got time for it and dont want one
in a cabinet below the tv but dont pick anything up unless you plan on buying it
so we went to see when the first available would be
his fades are clean and precise
she cut my finger
atmosphere nicely and modernly renovated
i am placing this review here because ladies and gentlemen salon and spa owns brown aveda school
im getting my 3rd laser treatment today and have only positive things to say about la laser and their entire staff
definitely worth the visit
because i will not even sit down for service i will just walk right out again tweety was 5 stars but the cleanliness is 2 stars
my favourite practitioner now is christina
great experience came in late and got a gel mani and pedi
reasonable prices compared to most nail salons too
this was my favorite reggae spot up until last weekend
i will start with the plus though polished gives you unlimited drinks while you are there getting your nails toes eyebrows etc
otherwise everyone is very friendly
its inexpensive currently 13 for a regular mens cut and ive only been pressured to buy an extra product once this lady made a big long story up about how she could see new hair growth on my head and then ended her pitch with some special cream that they only sold at their store
she had to make the long trek around the other chairs to move from my head to my feet since there was  a table blocking her pathway
i asked them to stay away from my head but that was the first place they massaged
i had a 50 luxor voucher i redeemed here
he was so meticulous making sure each nail was perfect and i couldnt be happier with the job he did
the tattoo artist shannon came out to talk to us shook our hands showed us the tattoo hed drawn up which he was able to do based on a crappy picture id sent and really really poor dimensions im not good with measurements okay
those guys are pretty awesome
she made my brazilian 100 painless and my eyebrows beautiful and was extremely thorough
i was so disgusted by their behavior
a straight hair cut is 32
i just love orsi
im so there
ive done the vegas scene in the past my younger years now going back after having two kids i wanted to stay away from the clubbing crowds
the building is run down and badly painted
almost all of these girls look like clowns with all their makeup
i just had my eyebrows waxed and shaped by rachael
great place for men to get a cut and the neck shave is great
i came here with a friend i personally didnt buy anything but i certainly had a decent time learning about all the products
i am beyond frustrated and took my braids out that very day cause they looked terrible
i mean it was only right that my girls and i see what all the fuss was about after all we call ourselves the wolf pack
it is getting difficult to find barbers these days and there is truly no substitute for the cut provided by a barber vs a stylist when it comes to mens hair
he gave me water when i cam out and it was in a plastic cup no water bottle
i was not impressed with my lmt this visit
i didnt want to make the same mistake twice
clearly theyre not working in the corners of the nail
this place is great
what a great addition to the team at this salon
the salon isnt dated  corny looking like some others in vegas
unlike cool cuts for kids there are basic chairs instead of trainstrucks etc
i love this place
when she was doing my nails she quickly without any care in the world put on the extensions and put on the acrylic and done
not enough detail went into cutting and cleaning even though when i was asked thats what i said needed the most attention
the associates with helpful if not a little hoverish but nothing too bad
i am in love with my new nail set
she wants you to love your nails
i went to this fantastic sams this evening and had jessie as my stylist
the building can be overwhelming but you can find your true self as you walk the halls and look at all the student art
a 50 tip imposed
i love that their membership offers multiple options and free access to their core wellness classes
michelle did an excellent job on my facial
they make you feel very comfortable and relaxed
even without the yelp deal the usual room rates here are unbeatable for its quality and quantity
hotel spas charge doubleboth therapists were very strong and listened to what we wanted and found all of the knots
i had chrome shellac on for a wedding i attended  and he tried to use one piece of aluminum and one cotton swab for all the toes instead of wrapping them individually
the location is awesome with all the near by shopping
i have to say that he showed the same care and skill for my own haircut
do not go here
although it feels like torture during the process
i love this shop
from the car park to the layout of this locals joint i dont care for it at all
flamingo has better water pressure than these guys
so grateful to have found her
i used to go to creative and followed lynn to lv nails because she does an excellent gel mani
dance clubs lounge there were two cherry and lucky
and i was told i have to pay 5000 although no services were provided
we were waiting as well
i was done and said at a conversational level im out of here
he said he would call me back that day which was in the beginning of july and as of today august 19thsurprise
me and my daughter stopped in since we were in the neighborhood
drive up to the portico check in and look at a map for your room
they messed up my eyebrows more than once
she said itd be about 15 minutes so i ran next door to the stussy store and ran back and they still werent ready
its always clean when i come in and their decorations are nice  no tacky nail posters like some other places ive been to and they have tv
they have good stuff for women i just wish they kept the sale stuff around for longer
its fun to wander around and be able to sit in one of the many public areas but feel like you are all alone with your significant other
not hearing anything from them for 34 days i decided to look for a new salon
i have visited shauna a few times now and she never disappoints
just go to eos this place is a joke
the staff is friendly and takes great care in making sure youre comfortable and enjoying yourself
what does eating or not eating spicy food have to do with anything
once again i have a problem with a distinct lack of customer service
i like a more real natural look
go see anthony
this was on september 17th
our suite was handsomely decorated all dark wood with a modern flair and the best view with floor to ceiling windows the length of the suite complete with power shades  room darkening shades
thank you signature nails for setting the precedent for how a nail salon should be operated
i didnt see that anywhere on the website but i never carry cash or checks on me so i think thats important to note
the staff are friendly enough and the establishment always looks clean in the front
thanks so much
a little back story i lost my mother 5 months ago moved into a new place started a new job where i work 6 days a week and am planning a wedding a romanticrelaxing staycation was definitely needed
nilson at hypnotic tattoo is the best
i dont live close to the area but its well worth the drive
so  check one off for me on that list
and she also did a killer job on the bangs  theyre really versatile i can wear them straight across or angle them and when you have short hair its a bonus to have versatility in your bangs
this place is absolutely amazing  not only that so is sarah
her advice was to take the jewelry out in order to avoid problems
we were sitting at the pool and it got a bit cloudy so they told us we had to evacuate the pool
huge selection on nail polishes
same storyhungover as hell  still wanted to enjoy our trip
the staff was very friendly and the ladies that worked on us did a fantastic job
they offer drinks for you to have while your getting your service done
didnt like parking in a structure a mile away and fudging for payment each time i entered and exitedto avoid a retarded 27 valet charge
when we got to the resort the receptionist could not find our reservation in her system because it was made through the 3d party so she asked us  to wait for the other receptionist to deal with us
they dont trim cuticles or clean under your nails
i tried explaining to her that this is not the first time and i might not have as much knowledge as she does but i do know the minimum because ive been doing my nails here and there just in montreal and that this is the first time my nails hurt
it was a little bit out of my way but decided to give it a try
if you are giving up on your skin like i was i really cant recommend her enough
now when i clean my face its so much better
this place is crap
msebru also gave my daughter a lesson in hair care and answered all her questions about her new do
tina did my gels manicure as well as my pedicure
i tried it once and thats good enough for me
note to customers its a hidden gem
ahhh where to start with the amazing qua spa i come here whenever i stay at caesars which is at least once a month
currently running a 20 off promotion through the end of june
i made an appointment with josh and was seen at a very reasonable timeframe from when i arrived
he did my toes messed one up by cutting too deep and then didnt even ask if i wanted a design
this is my new go to nail salon
she is very creative when it comes to colors and designs
he came out in more pain then he went in
i have routinely gone years between dental visits and the hygienists are always amazed how little plaque i have
they were already closed for the night so there was no going back and i have a flight to catch in the morning
their pedicures are pretty decent in terms of foot scrubs and paint job
i always get compliments on my nails
wow my hair lays the right way now and i can actually work with it at home
we are replaceable and he lets you know it
they were able to accommodate me about two hours after i called
so clean and warm and friendly
this is therapeutic massage
he recommended mary jane for the style we wanted and walked us to the front
im a local and we are blessed to have some fantastic salons all over town but this one is my hands down favorite
i waisted 60 on crappy nails
clean and friendly
i chose the bebe pedicure
the best part though was that we had a back porch with lounge chairs where we sat and watched rabbits playing
i will definitely be returning especially since they carry so much of the ben nye brand
however unlike other reviewers they didnt charge us a 20 resort fee
thanks to my beastmode bestie suzy h for referring me to socrates the deep tissue expert here at massage envy
it is smaller than a shopping cart
ive been to so many nail salons where you are just a customer just more money
you know what happened nexteveryone began speaking in another language and i became the enemy
hes a kid needs something fast and to be presentable i know it wont be salonquality
we showed up in the middle of the advertised hours to be told the minnow salon was closed because they had too many other customers in the other part of the salon
i just wanted something to put on before i put on my make up so that it would stick
love this place went not too long ago to get the hot stone massage
the most beautiful and inspirational place to practice in the whole valley if not the whole state
also see lyna
i have been to color me bella salon several times for hair and massage treatments
tips for your next new tat when booking drop in to look at the books on the counter  see which artists aligns with the type of tat youre looking for
ive been going to m lovely nails on and off for almost 10 years
thank you norma and dr bass for everything you have done for me
walking in i was impressed
nooshi the senior stylist was not chatty but her work spoke volumes about her calibre
we ordered the korean tacos kalbi ribs and chow fun
my rating will be 5 stars if our next visit is as good
i was browsing a few locations for make up and hair for a family wedding the next day
now typically that would have been okay if they did that to start with on my unstripped hair
this place is extremely clean and professional
why didnt i do this sooner
all skin is not created equal and linda knows and respects each client as an individual
bee was just so nice and friendly as well
this has been my go to spot for months now
the second esthetician told me the trick is to wax the hair from the different directions that it grows
if you are going to pick a place to get your stressed relieved this is the place
cori even suggested some other herbs to help keep my system regular and so far its been working
the only reason i am giving this place two stars instead of one is because the staff is usually very pleasant they make you feel more than welcome and the clinic is nicer looking
both ladies are extremely professional on time courteous highly educated in their profession and just simply make you feel welcomed
waited a couple weeks figured it wasnt a big deal i would give 702 another try and also try the natural dip polish amy told me about she said its better for you than gel polish
awful salespeople who catcall you from 10 feet away as you are just trying to enter the mall
he responded with i love that
their website states it retains the natural beeswax smell
i will most certainly be back for more when i finish up these treatments and save up a bit
tyler is amazing
its resulted in a very messy store with many samples being ruined and a bit soiled
insensitive to customer requests
theyre all very polite respectful and easy to approach individuals with a professional demeanor
my mom happens to be in the states so i picked up the set for me and im send some flowers her way in 2 weeks
i told him multiple times be careful its getting short
at that point 2 of the girls left
many days the rooms are still being made up at 430 in the afternoon
i am going out of town this weekend to my old salon where i texted my old nail lady the pictures of my fingers she also has started doing this technique along with regular gel polish and other types of manicures and she showed the other nail techs in the salon they were appalled and couldnt believe how terrible they looked they are going to try to file some of the thick layer off but are worried that itll further damage my nails
caution as you shop though  despite the moderate prices everything adds up
i dont have a regular massage therapist but i havent had a bad one yet
please dont tip based on the price of the hair cut tip based on the quality of hair cut and the time and skill he puts into it
i had my gel manicure done by v and kevin
ive never stayed here so i cant say anything about their hotel rooms but as far as some of their regular casino features the south point does a damn good job
went today with my sister and her daughter 3yrs old for my nieces first pedimani
i was hesitate to try this place since they are only a few reviews but i went for it because the few on here are mostly really positive
i took my mother here for her birthday
unibrow and all  ill wait for sally
this location runs like a well oiled machine and the entire staff is so professional and each room is clean but welcoming
ill be coming back here again
sometimes i feel a stylist can be real talented at color and ok at cut and vice versa
can i just say expedia dot cooooooooooooooooooooom helltotheyes
this place is huge
i have had countless pedicures in my life
went into get a hair consultation and left without booking an appointment heres why this was my first time getting a hair consultation since i wanted to colour my hair this ombre purple and had many questions and concerns about the process before proceeding with my decision
i am never ever going to send my son there again
ive left roni josef with several different styles by request of course and i have been pleasantly surprised with the result time and time again
blow drys are never included and they try to book you with sr stylists at 5500 to get your hair dried after spending over 200 on colour
the front door remains open which offers up a light breeze leaving the air fresh and free of chemicals
ill be back
the control panel for all the rooms goodies didnt work and the complimentary chocolate chip muffin was dry
unfortunately thats not what i received
this week and im so glad i did
worst place ever to get your hair sewin weave at
it was 70 not including tip for both of us for an hour
having been to other massage places this one is far superior
im not sure why this place doesnt have more reviews
they offer a large selection of complementary drinks
ive passed by this place many times and never noticed it so its best to know what complex to go to
i gotta say it shes amazing
she was clueless on how to shape them
the gentleman i spoke with said they would be able to do 5 of us at a time and then the other 5 immediately after
it is not the kind of wow amazing turnout i had with some tony  guy stylists
go there you wont regret it
ive never seen such pretty couches chairs lamps everything was so beautiful
i am super meticulous on my gel manicures
dont go here if you want something more than a basic haircut
on top of it all rony is a great guy and makes the entire experience of getting your haircut a lot of fun
sasha was great my eyebrows looked amazing
what other salonspa does that
i researched salons for weeks and called a few places ultimately going to another salon to see a coloriststylist who came highly recommended  bad idea
my acne still flared up but i couldnt live with my body in that much pain every day
natalie is so helpful and answers all of my questions
not relaxing at all
clearly a scam
i cannot say enough great things about this place
the security person was cooperative and searched to no avail
are you serious
i cant say enough about how great he was and how great this place is
fries onion rings and the tempura asparagus and shiitake mushrooms were all big hits at well
i was neither overall pleased nor disappointed with amelia c  co overall i suppose they got the job done for having never had a preliminary trial run
my hair looks and feels amazing
the hair color is great though
the entire process at massage heights is extremely client oriented
she was really sweet and helped me pick all the right items
walkins are welcome but i recommend calling ahead to secure an appointment
those two are doing big things
her prices are very reasonable and she was even able to get me in same day just 1 hour after i called
this establishment will not be getting my business in the future
she fought me on it and kept saying no or too thick to be gel and i kept assuring her that is was in fact gel
i participate in endurance races ie
today they fixed my awful mani from a different place i tried out bad mistake
my wife loves this place
she makes it work
also its a goddamn no brainer that the other parts of our body is a different color from our face
of course its one thing to read and another to actually try
the fact that they are also ecofriendly makes me love this place even more
i was in and out within 10 minutes for my underarms and bikini
his shop is spotless and they keep their equipment just as spotless
i cant wait to go back im almost giddy
youre going to start eventually why not now and why not here
this is not your average walk in great clips cookie cutter stylist
i love the products kimberly recommends and she is very knowledgable about them
just a bad feel all together
we worked with tracy andie and alissa sorry if these names are misspelled
it can be better maintained for the amount of staff sitting around on their laptops
aga and  denise are the best mt i have ever had and i have been having regular massage for 21 years
i asked for my nails to be painted only on the tip but apparently thats too complicated so i told the lady id go home and do it myself which is what i did
im never leave feeling rushed
since my eyes were closed mostly i think that the service skill and care are more important than a flashy looking room
she fills up quick because she is awesome
i sure wouldnt want someone like that touching me
ryan was very informative  took the time to talk about the different types of jewelry as well as the piercing process itself
what happened to this place
i never want my hair thinned out
both reny and charlie will have you leaving the place looking and feeling like a million bucks
kind of embarrassing but that just shows how much i trust her and how good she is at what she does
before i started coming here my eyebrows were nicely thick just not shaped very well
antony is an awesome hairstylist
staff are great
the pool and the bar looked nice
theres another waiting area that people can use to wait for their service
my hair has never looked so good
walgreens is not only the pharmacy of my choice but a great place for me to pick up little things like razors face wash etc without having to deal with big box stores like albertsons or smiths
maria is who answered the phone and she was incredibly rude and unprofessional
it shows who i prefer to invest in
well i wasnt in the mood to try new things since i was in so much pain
i searched for long time for a good hairdresser i would say a good one for my really not so good hair
everyone friendly and knowledgeable
thank you skin design for being so accommodating friendly  and professional
i find the owner and other instructors to be friendly  welcoming and knowledgeable about there craft
i will definitely go back and recommend this to my friends
imagine it would be the perfect joint to for birthdays or with a bridal party for a fine pedicure and a fun atmosphere
if you want a nice room go down the road to starwood luxury collections phoenician much nicer iconic resort for the same rates
nikki has been my stylist for a long time now and she is fantastic
she also gives me good tips on how to keep my hair healthy recommends great products
i will return
it is people like you that we are happy to support and privileged to have whether as a stylist or a neighbor  so thankyou again for your ability to respond outside the box and selflessness it was greatly appreciated
i highly recommend her
i was very impressed with blue lotus
as far as other food options the mgm is a ten minute walk as well as the strip
usually i go to the ray daniels at centerpoint but decided to give it a try at north york center
plus your first service is half off
after the massage we went to do our float
i went back and forth on what level of lash technician to book with
an abc store in vegas
this may work for their curriculum but as a paying patron i find this unacceptable
reading these reviews id love to receive the service and courtesy they received
suzanne is amazing
ive been here twice and have decided to never go anywhere else
i have received a spray tan dermasweep and an eyebrow wax
we arrived late on our flight at 1100 pm after which we were starved
i was supposed to go out to dinner with husband and enjpy myself instead i spent hours crying because this cut cannot be fixed properly until it grows
i was the maid of honor in her wedding and my appointment was scheduled for 1030am the last scheduled of the bridal party
i assume thats why models and actors make up a portion of her loyal clientele
i took the lashes out myself
its located in a converted house on the south side of indian school rd nice decorations and the people are all very friendly
his prices are fair and to me definitely worth it
prices are a tad high but so far the best manicure ive gotten in vegas
ham was dry beef was tough shrimp was over cooked and coldi could go on and on
why would they sell them if they are just going to treat the people like absolute crap
as i say in the chair i changed my mind and decided to get a pedicure
quality depends what you want
they did exactly what i asked and made me feel like a whole new me
i mean beautiful room
ive gone to a lot of places before finding a salon i liked
the service is unbeatable and the quality is great as well
my next service was makeup i was given a consultation and received some input from the artist i am so happy she gave my some input i have never been this happy to have my makeup done
ill be back
maybe for spa weekbut probably not for a full service treatment
the guys are hilarious and you wont regret stopping in
whywe are overpaying for you to pay your entire mortgage in a weekend
after 5 or so in the past this one was super potent
i had so many left over hairs that i had to go home and pluck them myself
i did read the previous review and it would seem any issues glama gals had back in 2011 were taken care of now
despite the disappointment of not being to get a manipedi i would recommend spa lamar
id even pay 50 for a cut
would definitely come back next time im back in town
it is tucked in between two other stores i missed it the first time
i always leave the salon admiring my nails on how good they look and how good they feel
when my nails were drying they put a special oil drop to speed the drying process   cool never had that before
she makes my sad poor brittle short nails perfect every time
if i could give them 0 stars i wouldve
everyone at the salon is super sweet and helpful
daian your the best
it really showed their expertise
i thought the massage was great
i am big on hygiene and this place lacked in cleanliness
had i known it was going to look like this i wouldnt have never paid the  money for the sns and just got a regular acrylic base with white polish
she was going so fast so rough and a little bit jittery
they are friendly and inviting
i asked him to make my nails shorter and he responded with theyre already short and he didnt do what i wanted
i found candy nails shop on yelp and im so happy i did
my skin felt so soft to touch and i left feeling sooooo relaxed it was great
for as long as ive known him he has been equal parts dj and hairstylist and incredibly talented at both
more importantly the staff is incredible
this place has a lot of colour options for shellac and they provide really good service
and clearly enjoys his job
take a ride in the 1960 cadillac coupe deville for any parties of 4 or more
he also took about 5 minutes to clean the area prior to starting on my tattoo
highly recommend jon to anyone
some of the side dishes could use some work
c wonder if i could leave a gratuity on my card i could im hooked
and when she paint them the polish wasnt even and it bubbled
i highly recommend chancy
the staff is super
i am now able to go from a sitting or lying position to standing up with no pain or discomfort
he then said you know what i say about sparring he then gets right in her ear and says clothing is optional
he always styles my hair even when i tell him that i dont need it
i live about 4 minutes from this place and the reviews led me to give them a shot
what cakes l stated is wrong
where have the last 25 years gone and who took my radiant and youthful skin
tucked away in the north part of town square which gives you a reason to go shopping or eating after getting pampered at look
they have all the stores i want to shop at and the sales tax is less than the cuy
he came home with a 14 back wax and she didnt even make it look normal
so i have a glob of silver on one nail which is just obnoxious
ill def continue to come back to this place
no pink areas and no irritation
the entire process took 6 hours
shes this petite little blonde thing that looks like she wouldnt even last two seconds in a street brawl
i returned to this location and i purchased a blow dryer a chi round brush and some rusk shampoo
after she laid me on the table and applied pads to my eyes i gave her the spiel i gave stevie about wanting to get a lot of eyelashes happy to pay extra etc
shes not very nice and could not answer basic questions does not listen well at all
she does not come across as a people person and i witnessed a couple other encounters between her and prospective customers and she could soften her tone a bit
enjoyed being in a smaller studio setting
on top of the pro style tbs has they have the best prices
all good stuff and no yucky parabens or sulphates
next time im in town ill stop back
i asked if they happened to have anything available that evening as i was off work early and able to get over there before they closed at the very inconvenient time for someone who works an 8530 job at 7pm hours all over the internet are incorrect for this place
let the pampering begin
i went here for the first time on saturday morning made an appointment as i had a coupon for this place
the last time i was in i got a pedicure
the bubble bath is one of the biggest ive seen
the biggest downside is the walk from here to the strip
halfway through the manicure they bring out the shellac bottle which clearly was not shellac but some cheap no name brand
so impressed i book a few packages
it was what i expected
you can smell this place several doors down in the mall
i liked the experience so much that i signed up for the membership plan which makes the services even more affordable
i love the cut and the purple highlights she did are excellent
my only critique is maybe hire a couple more barbers but besides that if ur in the area give them a shot
i found this place via a groupon deal but will keep returning because it is a gemw this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if youre connected in any way to the owner or employees
my stylist was amazing i went from very long hair to a bob
the best that charlotte has to offer
this has worked well for me in the past with happy feet on decatur behind the deja vu adult store which from now on im going to make that extra drive to receive the service i want
i will most definitely be going back to her for my next cut
figured it would be a good way to loosen up my muscles
i have zero regret  will probably keep extensions even when my own hair is long again
no the feel i got when i entered was that of cleanliness with their brilliant white furniture in the front and black pedicure chairs in the back
after getting home and trying to product completely vs her just dabbing a little on me i realized the product was way too fair for my skin and in pictures that night i looked very unnaturally pale
my phn wont scroll back far enough to see a previous  review so i figured it was time for a fresh one proving even a yr later im still thrilled with their service
nailgoals thanks katie
just moved here from the west coast
the entire experience was fabulous from the very beginning
as i was getting a genital piercing one could easily become uncomfortable but i didnt feel so at all with her
theyre really on top of their customer service
they have excellent customer service and a relaxed fun atmosphere
good service but definitely huge communication barrier even if you have photos to compare
if you want an honest opinion here you go apologies for the essay
tara gave me a wonderful rainforest pedicure with gelish color
peace chad m rothe
the buzz the vibe the awesomeness abound and i always emerge beaming
the salon was clean the woman who did my nails was kind and i was satisfied but not overly impressed
the nail polish did not cover the full nails
the tub where you put your feet did not looked like they have been washed and to topit off the towels they used where all raggedy and ripped up
great cuts at a good price
their policy is no returns on gift certificates but they waived it and credited my card immediately
if you want to look like you are on the red carpet go see her
emilys that good
a couple of them were too short to make them square
i really appreciate the great customer service
ask for shaista trust me shes amazing at her job
i got the groupon deal totally worth it
it gives the stores some spunk
hat mich gefreut dass ich als sportlicher typ erkannt wurde  ich freue mich schon jetzt auf meinen nchsten besuch ps
love the decor and the fresh scent which im sure they pump through the ventilation system
its definitely pricey
great atmosphere clean and very welcoming
i had little to no wait time
bobbi consistently goes the extra mile to ensure complete satisfaction of all clients
i will not go back to this nail place and you shouldnt go either
scarlett has you choose from different designs
planned to sleep in and take a later fight
the color was also fantastic very natural
two of us ended with female therapists even though we specifically asked for men at the time of the booking and that was confirmed
thats really fine for las vegas
coming from ny this is the type of old school barber shop every man should go to
loved this place
first time at european wax center to get my brows waxed i even used the free wax they give
great service clean and perfect nails
ive had a few that were terrible many that were okay and some that were very good
she knew how to do a great blow out
you dont leave looking done but rather as if you were actually good at makeup and did it yourself
jenny did my pedicure and it looks great
again im shocked that i am getting an excellent haircut consistently  and for 26
definitely keep seeing her
its amazingand my bf loves them
granted  we chose to have a car and we chose to self park at the cosmopolitan instead of paying 13 18 tip each time at vdara for valet
less than a month ago i was going to nyc on a girls trip and my brows were out of control
i had long hair and wanted 6 inches off in a stylish wayi walked outta there with walmart salon hairstudent cosmetologist hairno offense to those of you talented or learning people in those places 3 inches longer than i told her i wanted unflattering unblended layers
while my friend was getting demos and introduced to their products a sales associate by the name of sasha came up to me and asked how i was doing
its just completely incomprehensible how someone can get shot on your property and youre not only rude to the victims but you do nothing to assure them that youll try making the property safer for other in the future
i left extremely irritated
there has been alot of change in staff but anyone you get is always awesome
i have left very happy each time and i always receive compliments on my nails from others
however id probably let andrea do my hair on the street if that was my only choice
if you use a credit card it is just a pending transaction and will be immediately released back to your credit line after you checkout
im a nurse myself and i traveled far because dr stile  his staff made me feel comfortable  more importantly safe
also the shower stall in the suite is seethrough which is in the same room as the toilet so if youre not comfortable naked around other people work out a wash schedule
she paraphrased my request saying oh so you dont want rainbow bangs
the first and only time i have been to pro nails i had a horrible gel manicure
its not a fancy spa but its great quality and service
the cut was reasonably priced the hair washscalp rub in the beginning alone made it worth the price
you get what you pay for with your 21 haircut
the idiot at the photo told me to go stand by the beers when i asked if i could take a passport photo there
my face had not felt that smooth since i was 13 i also appreciated that evan the owner was walking the sidewalk and chatting with customers and passersby
i think my issues with philip pelusi are with the company itself not with the staff here or at any of the other locations ive visited to be honest
and staff is all very friendly
this also happened to me when i was in the neighborhood looking for a consultation
i never get prescriptions filled in a timely manner and on more than one occasion they have given me misinformation about the medicine i am taking
everyone i have ever encountered has always been courteous professional and so helpful
she said i could probably do some curls and pin them up
the prices are very reasonable and they have several locations in the valley
follow me on twitter
they are great people that do great work
i have gone to nail bar spa several times for pedicures and have always been pleased with the results
amazing quality of service
as the class went on i became more and more frustrated
as i expected it was a mad house that saturday afternoon people and stylists everywhere
so relaxing friendly and profession
i will definitely come back again
elise m is the best in the business
i was rebooked with lesley and she did a great job
very spacious and clean with beautiful wood and a lovely aroma
now for the negatives this is the worst salon pedicure ive ever gotten
he took a lot of care while cutting my nails
i used the jwoww lotion
their prices on polish are cheapest in town
that was last summer i went back a few weeks ago because i was visiting my brother again and this place is conveniently around the block from him and i got the 35 manipedi my cuticles werent even touched and they looked dry after they were done
she is honest about what is possible and explains what certain choices might not give you the results you are looking for
today was the best massage ive ever had and ive had quite a few
all the products are wonderful with great qualities
for a girl as into gross consumerism as i one would think barneys would represent the ultimate altar at which to worship
i have been looking for a good place to get my nails done for over a year
my favourite place for a mani pedi in toronto
but he was patient and reassuring with me
it was awful
i love my balayage
when all done waited another half hour to get manicure
not worth my time or money
wow stay away
when complete with a full blowout it looked beautiful and they even took an after picture under their nice lights at the front of the salon
i called a day ahead and got an apt right when i wanted it
we went dying hair and cut hair together
she always gives her truthful opinion and i am so grateful for that
dont waste your time or money
the attitude of this establishment seems to be we are the red rock and you are not so get over yourself  you are lucky that we are allowing you to stay here or attempt to stay here
i got fed up with that then grabbed the foundation of the bag and shook it so she could hear it was in there
it is cleaner it has less traffic so it makes it more enjoyable experience and theres actually inventory here most of the time
i dont think i will be returning
i would move to phoenix for this nail salon alone
brad is a talented barber and great with a straight razor
update even though ann doesnt have someone taking appointments for her anytime i need her or need an appointment i just text her and she gets back to me within a day
when we went back we were charged another copay
they ended up doing the airbrush on my face and i loved it
i just got my eyebrow extensions done by her today
my nails looked good
with the amount of time she took my nails arent even opaque enough and is still very sheer
and not be able to stop bleeding
if you are gamblers probably it is not convenient for you
doesnt hurt to ask if they have any promotion when you call in to book your appointment
in total i paid around 360 or so including the cost for a small trim which at 55 tax was a bit much in my opinion so clarify costs beforehand
i had called ahead when i booked and was told that i would be free to use the pool and showers etc
i had 2 smoothies and both were really good
came in because of the reviews and im honestly shocked why the rating is so high
will never go anywhere else now that i think im addicted
my personal favorite thing about the m
i dont think there is anything else i can say about miss dixiebelle that has not already been said not only is the store full of fabulous clothing the staff are incredibly friendly and the styling
this is my go to spot in vegas for sure
luckily the waiting part wasnt too long just a bit uncomfortable
check out the vdara
i keep running into this here in vegas so either im too picky i dont think i am or its like finding a needle in a haystack to get a quality pedicure here
they have tvs on the walls with sports on and the staff is very friendly and does a great job
off back to the battle of finding the right place in this city to get my brows done at
to me when i walked in anyways this poor girl looked exhausted and fed up but was very nice to me
no one at the reception desk to check me in
my besties therapist is sue and she is also great
welcoming staff lots of colours to choose from
everyone was so nice and friendly
so happy they are so close to my house
i am locked in until my membership is up which cannot get here fast enough
renee understood exactly what i wanted took her time like a good artist and engaged in a pleasant conversation throughout the appointment
lady there just nodded and took a photo with a poor resolution handheld camera
not only did she do a complete makeover on my hair she offered many tips on how to keep my color fresh without fading and changing color which is the problem i have had in the past
my facial was very relaxing and my skin feels amazing
said she isnt sure why it didnt take that well but there is definitely curl
cant lie never seen anyone else in her shop ive only had mary work on me
felt good on the back
she taught me a lot about the eyebrows removal technique that was ideal which is waxing
i asked them to bring my purse back so i could sit in my car for at least some quiet time before my appt
now that is how you dazzle your customer
her website is also iphone friendly so you can book from wherever
she is amazing
well i wrote about my horror story regarding teeth whitening im happy to say this was the opposite
this was what i like to call the notsocoolpreyelpme who had absolutely no idea what was happening
i asked if she could just quickly paint over what was left on there
there was even a lineup to use the showers i think only about 45 stalls in total which i found frustrating
my sons dad and i are pretty particular about my sons hair so i was a little skeptical but stephanie did not disappoint
other reviewers were spot on about this place
before the facial started chelsea went over my concerns  explained what it would entail
oh and the other lady doing lashes in the next room had done 3 clients in the time i was there
another reason it turned out bad was bc she didnt use any toner at all on the blonde which left me really brassy  very disappointing because i feel like i would have had better results if id done diy ombre following a youtube tutorial at home now to be fair i didnt go back to let her know i was unhappy
i recommend them to everyone
the staff are very friendly i first got my brows done with daisy who is such a fun bubbly person but have been regularly seen by glenn who does a great job
my haircut turned out great and i had a fun time couldnt ask for more
even though we were placed really far down the hall i still enjoyed my stay here simply because it was a good price for the level of comfort you get
sarah knows her lashes
i have followed her for a few years now to every salon shes been with and i couldnt be happier
the overall quality for the manipedi was average to below average
i even had to comment on the fact that she was laughing it was very unprofessional
it probably doesnt help that i had my birthday this week
though for 15 it was nice to get a straight razor shave i noticed the cut was pretty sloppy after i left
im seated with my feet in water for 50 minutes without any sort of a pedicure
80 of the group classes that i have attended at lifetime south austin the studio rooms have been 85 degrees or higher in temperature
i believe they have an ipad but two of their staff their just gave me the most horrible attitude that i would not recommend this place for lashes at all
there are hair salons and barber shops everywhere we have many options where to go
my hair is longer healthier and shinier he even found me the best nontoxic hair color that i love
its hard find a good barbershop like this one no wonder is called 5 star barbershop
when i first came into suddenly slimmer i had just had my first child and was 45 pounds heavier than i currently am
then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things
i was completely impressed by this nail place
i was so thankful to get in as a walk in today
she had short blondish looking hair and she was very petite
kennys is in a nice location in downtown pittsburgh and always makes for a nice way to spend your lunch hour
shes not afraid to go deep to get to the source of the pain and shes gifted and intuitive and wellmagical
stavros opened this hair salon in may 2010 with clean modern dcor and friendly service
i had also signed a paper what gave them permission to ship the product
a friend and i came in to get nose piercings and was greeted by shereeshe was quite nice and did a really nice job in comforting me i thought i was gonna throw up lol
she was recommended to me from my aesthetician jennifer swink when i asked if she knew anyone for bridal makeup
according to my mental tally of top five haircuts this one ranks second in my long career of barbershoppering
my face has never looked this good
crapper has it own sliding door
she gave me a really natural look with products i could actually is and replicate
im sick of trendy places that focus more on the look of the place rather than the quality of the service
both times i have had wonderful conversations with the nail techs
if youre looking for a professional stylish shop with a comfortable atmosphere this is the place
it is rare to find a stylist who takes such care and is talented as well
in addition to the ultra friendly educated and just family like staff and environment at alchemy i find their pricing to be extremely reasonable and i would be completely comfortable to pay more for the services i receive
oh and of course my nails look amazing
i will definitely be coming back soon
she truly knows how to relax my body and mind
she was with a customer so i tell her that my nails  all came off and i need to get them redone
i love these guys here
otherwise its an ok place for a cut just be sure and tell them you dont want extra stuff if youre not planning to pay for it
even allowed a free upgrade not common these days
i have noticed a decline in the quality of the regular mani pedi
my honest opinion
i will not be returning to your establishment which is a shame because your stylists are very professional and nice
regina was originally head therapist at esspa in aspinwall now head therapist at this new spa sugar spa and beauty bar on babcock blvd it is downstairs from studio raw
after reading all the great reviews on yelp i went into white lotus as an upgrade from supercuts o this is coming from someone who considers a ponytail doing their hair
my brows look great
pros  salon is clean and spacious  amazing job with mani pedi  shellac lasts over 4 weeks as long as you take care of it and do not pick your nails  price is very competitive and no extra charge for french shallac refill with no manicure is only 15  cathy is super nice and professional  make an appointment in advance and the team works hard to be ontime  added bonus is the fantastic italian grocery store in the mall cons  they have a team of 23 working so i would not suggest booking a party of more than 3 unless you stack the appointments
i got a complimentary manicure while i waited
we were in separate cars so i had her on the phone chatting as we pulled into the lot
i scheduled my appointment with chuck online
it cost 35
keep up the good work
i might go back but would recommend trying to schedule during a quieter time
i have been looking for a good barber shop ever since i moved to matthews and 3 years later i believe i have finally found one
i sat down with tami the owner and nail tech and she was awesome
mt is the best tech ever
very cheap prices  and paying a high price for beauty doesnt necessarily mean the service is better right
the last time i was at this location in particular it was in the afternoon in the middle of the week so i had a great experience
all of the staff were very friendly many polish choices and it was clean
once i saw the matte gel top coat mani and the handpainted fall leaves i knew lavish nails was a musttry
i came from dc crossing my fingers to find a nice one that would give me great service
the only downfall about staying at the signature is the desk service or lack thereof if you stay at tower 3 since the desk closes before midnight
just be aware that it can get busy and sometimes you do feel a bit out of place with the hustle and bustle
i asked her to go shorter she said are you sure and still didnt cut what i asked for  she said she liked my length and if i wanted bangs after all this i could come back
the staff are very friendly and knowledge
going to kellys lovely salon is the highlight of my month and i always leave feeling like a movie star
like i said my nail tech was fine but i wont go back and support a group that treats their employees like that
only downside is that you have to pay for wifi
he told me what he would not be doing which is where so many people go wrong with my crazy thicklong hair
i visited home for the holidays and had amy color correct my hair that was just so so messed up from a new hairdresser id been seeing in seattle who just couldnt get it right
they take their time
sometimes a girls wants to splurge on going to the hair salon and sometimes there is not enough time or money to do that
my friend who also tried the jet shower there  in march 2013 8 months before my visit commented to me that it wasnt fully functional
the facilities werent anything special the service was soso and the quality was similar to what youd expect to receive at one of those nail chop shops
if you want to come to vegas and enjoy time with the family  this eliminates all the gambling ruckus youd hear in the other hotel lobbies
i told her i had no problem with her policy about providing the groupon code i just wanted to give her both at the same time
many shops are revolving doors of artists but not here
aweful customer service
vi and sau are super down to earth and always fun to be around
their patients are suffering but there is nobody available to help right away
one of the best haircuts ive had in years
the gym itself is a good size
paid 50 bucks for a sucky jobby thursday my nails started to lift and my toes were not cute looking the minute i walked out the shop
however ive gotten the same man twice who made my nails look awful
nikki is such a pleasure to work with and i cant wait to have her do my hair again in a few weeks
so definitely see them if you have any skin issues
the depth is perfect
i highly recommend megan at lash  sugar
i just had the best massage of my life
best place in phoenix to get your hair done
melissa is amazing
but they know exactly how to fade it
after being at the salon for over 2 hours i was ready to leave
i got the regular pedicure for 25 because it hasnt been that long since my last so i felt like i didnt need the other stuff
thank you so much
the bar was the busiest ive ever seen and jose the bartender was by himself
her new spa room is beautiful and cozy and she is also super flexible with scheduling
you can overspend at a big brand beauty salon or you can support a local family businesses like vivis while getting the same results
great place well definitely be back
jennifer is very patient with serving her guests and always try to make things perfect
if youre in the neighborhood pop by
i asked for the au jus for my prime rib and the meat guy came out and said he would make me some
tony gave an incredible massage
my therapist was great and had a nice technique she knew what she was doing
everyone in the party looked gorgeous and they were very professional and pleasant
after the color was washed out i touched my hair and already felt a ton of breakage
it also means that i couldnt see what she was doing
he put me in chair with broken armchair
that being said i also realize the reviews can be bias but so far ive had great success with this yelp
i did not complain i was flexible since i just wanted to get my manicure pedicure at this point and try this business out
i notice everything when i get my nails done because i used to get them done for 35 years straight and notice also that under one of my nails it wasnt checked to make sure it was smooth
for 40 i got a one hour treatment that included a foot massage and back massage with stones
the massage chair is always a welcomed treat and their chairs were good no complaints there
the staff are very helpful and they give free samples which is always a plus
i asked her to use a clean pair and with a great deal of attitude she wiped them off and sprayed with alcohol
however the cashier johntel was so slow and rude in processing the orders and allowing a group of 5 people cut in front of the line
i was all done when the girl doing my pedicure threw my shave foot skin back into the water that i was soaking my feet in
i never write reviews but want the word to get out about this place because i will be devastated if it doesnt succeed
as someone who hates pretentious settings but who wants quality product and professional service finding a comfortable salon had not been an easy task
my back felt so good when i got home and this whole week
roman is quit experienced as a barber
i believe in backing up small business owners and would rather give my money to them and not a corporation
she even took the time out to explain to me what shapes i need for my face type and how to comb and style my hair
with that being said i keep coming back because of fatin one of the stylists
i was quite happy when i saw it
i saw reviews on crystal on yelp and even though i never previously had gone to her i called
i love herbal nails
short haircuts require precision and she has it
the salon has a lot going for it late hours great location off 215 friendly staff easy appointment scheduling on yelp so hopefully the quality will improve
i loved the way lynn did my gel manicure
otherwise quick efficient and fastgo during the week youll be in and out fast
if i could give it zero stars believe me i would
will most definitely be back
never say never
he practices kinesiology and naturopathy which i really prefer rather than too much adjustments
she then countered her own statement by telling me she was just finishing a smoothie in the break room
this was not communicated between the staff because she said she had no idea of this  could not accommodate this because again she had to be somewhere at 9am
she was very patient and friendly all throughout the process
i have been looking for a new studio since i left new york
the rooms are clean and you begin to feel relaxed the moment you enter the esablishment
i have never chipped a nail or had it peel off so i think that they do a great job
the longest ive waited is a half hour
im now realizing as i type this that my mom is getting her hair done here by diane who shes been seeing for about 15 years
i couldnt ask for more
that coupled with glowing reviews from everyone else sealed the deal
where do i start as i arrived there i went straight to the video poker at one of the main bars to get a few drinks while i was playing
i was apprehensive as my experience with massage was not a positive one
we had made appointments and arrived 20 min early when we checked in at the desk the woman didnt say much but immediately showed us to our reserved beds
my preference is to spend my  locally so i looked for a salon close to home and i found peak  boy am i glad i did
the prices are reasonable
they offer snacks and drinks which was nice since our presentation was in the morning
very close to my house so i thought id try it out for a pedicure
overall i did not find the experience painful or unpleasant
after the initial exam we proceeded to the treatment
totally worth the trip off the strip
decided to check this place out because of the great reviews
we only stayed one day but would go back anytime
i liked the white tiled decor the uniforms with name tags of the attendants the fact they could speak english and it made it easier for me to communicate with them too the hygienic stations and the complimentary drink
i went for the consult and they took me right on time
my daughter and i had facials from amy and we were both very pleased
i have already booked my next appointment
will not be back
my friends have been raving about qua for a while
anyone who has ever done my hair my moms hair or my sisters hair which is pretty much all of them has done an excellent job but ill be sticking with diana or jennifer
we even got to sip on some red wine while they worked
im considering get more permanent makeup
thank you so very much lilly
came in at 130pm for balayage and wanted to go lighter all over and bring the blonde parts closer to my roots to cover my growth
the service i received was even better than my early visits under the previous owners
i was in so much pain from traveling and stress and 90 min later i had almost forgot what kind of pain i was in until he asked
i only had to wait about 10 minutes for the nail technician to prep my nail station for acrylics
i just love love love my first tattoo
it was my first time being spray tanned and they both went over all the details to know along with exactly what they used for their customers
when you come in they will greet you and offer you something to drink
said i made it like that because i would look at my nails
the cut is amazing
then after feeling me yank my foot back when she was trimming my cuticles she continued to rip away
the upkeep of the salon is great and all the nail techsworkers i have come in contact with at the salon are pleasant
we had a connecting panoramic suite added that was fit to sleep four
you may have experienced trying to book something online and then you call into a store and realize that the information is conflicting
i chose desert nail spa because of the wonderful reviews
i deal with chronic pain so i get massages fairly regularly and have had my share of different massagesmasseurs
you can have an incompetent team without leadership around i guess my son had a tap out session wtemp the artist tapped out and then played the i didnt understand card and although everyone understood my point of view no one did anything about it not even calling me back to say fuck you so im going to assume the silence no response not available when i call means the same
first of all i got there and she was just taking another client
a well known secret in charlotte
the phone call reminding you of your appointment the day before is a nice touch too
my fiance and i were able to relax together in a number of public spa areas including the outdoor plunge pool the view is a little less spectacular than they make it out to be on their website but i enjoyed that it was heated in the winter time the salt room the ergonomic leather chairs vibrate a little and they are so amazing
i just had the most frustrating depressing manicure ever first the lady at the reception said the could take me for manicure at 12 well i started at 1220 they could not remove my gel the excuse is oh they dont know what product i had on
we dropped our things off to the room got ready and headed out to walk the strip
my friends and i  are in town for my 40th birthday thought it would be fun to get a tattoo  to celebrate the occasion
the room i got resembled a studio apartment
we are both still losing weight
as i was entering the store i was halfgreeted by a staff member
ive never had a 1hr facial before with so much massage involved and i really loved that  also i appreciate that she was very thorough in explaining the products she used and what she recommends so that i could continue my skin care routine at home for optimal results
gave me the most perfect full coffin set
as i was leaving the shop ricky told me that a deals a deal and he still wanted to refund my original payment for the botched job
also a really good deal they offered also
lets just say i was not very pleased
i had seen a photo on rituals instagram page that mylla had done on someone else
the beds are always scrubbed down and ready for the next costumer
plenty of cvs to go check out now
see ali hell hook you up
contacting specific hairstylists individually have been horrible and lacking
this is where i got my first brazilian
you also have an option to get a 5 prep spray
i have visited this barbershop three times in the last 3 months and had received three haircuts
the nails were super thick  like little hooves on the end of each finger
the worst place i have ever gone
the results were nice  15 minutes only 10 for brows the bad
ive been a patient of dr mccrackens since 199697
check them out
thats never happened before
oh and the hairdresser that did my hair wreaked of cigarette smell
she asks you if you would like thick or thin eye brows and is very precise and patient
i took my daughter and her boyfriend here to have some relaxation before we started my daughters 21st birthday celebration weekend in vegas
from the beginning she just seemed kind of cold
she did my hair and makeup beautifully i couldnt have been more impressed
i do hope the product works as it did in the store
first of all holy sh the sales associates here are so rude
simply put i have never had an experience like this getting my nails done before
i recommend her to anyone needing a good massage in a comfortable relaxing setting
and a dry salt room which is the only downstairs area i have a complaint about
first i want everyone to know that i love my tattoo
i never felt rushed and the ladies took their time on my manicure pedicure
i bet it wont be 2 days before its falling off
while in vegas for my bachelorette party we decided we obviously needed new tattoos so hopped in a cab and had the driver take us to a good tattoo parlor in this day and age you wouldve thought we wouldve done some cellular research but we did not
i wasnt too thrilled about the seedy locationthere is another location at the sw side of town that i will try next time
the decor was adorable  posh
martina was very warm  relaxed and welcoming  and she seemed genuinely interested in my skin
i paid 3750 for a pedicure that looks like i did it myself
i was desperate and and this was my last resort
my mother inlaw norma resides in vegas and for mothers day she took me to a beautiful little salon to get eyelash extensions
i switched to amy the owner but during manicure she starts and then stops to manage business needs and then complains throughout the service that she works too hard and needs a day off
signing up for a membership was easy and its very economical
they understand quality craftsmanship and they are very versatile with the clippers
she glanced at them for a bit and proceeded to flip through a hair magazine pointing out some styles in order to confirm how id like the back of my head to look
next i asked for a pale natural looking pink shade
hannah is a great eyelash artist
they had no interest in talking to any of their clients
everyone in there was nice and i was in a chair within 10 mins of getting there on a friday at 4 dustin cut my hair and was quick and detail oriented
there is not a good selection of nail polish and they add thinner to it because it so old and thickened
i took my husband here for a birthday massage and i got one as well as we had a gift card to use
absolutely chic is in a hard to find location at the back of the little business park they are in
when i saw her repost something from guy tang that moment was the game changer
my husband is really into spas and i am often unwillingly dragged to them but because of that i have experienced a  fair share of 5 star spas
i would not want to trust my skin care to any other business
i expected a little more as other reviews are great
its hard to find a place where you can trust that they know what theyre doing
stanley was a junior stylist at the time and he happened to be available for a walkin
it was uneven thin and patchy
only afterwards did i think to ask for the manager so that i could express my displeasure with my experience
after she fixed my hair i was so happy on how she made it look compared to how it was
which means its always fully stocked and theres no line to check out
i am more than impressed with kelsey their newest stylist
i took the brochure they also do laser hair removal full body waxing  much more
long story short my body was in pain and severely dehydrated
tldr very professional hygenic and fast
his skin was amazing
she was amazing
my facial treatments are monthly and ever since i began with mary over a year ago my skin has never looked so fresh and youthful
and sometimes there is gel sometimes there isnt si i think sometimes they dont charge the laser to the fullest thus making the customer come back more time for the results
the fingernail and toenail polish had the same issues and it was done by 2 different manicurists so im unsure if it would be better by a different person
definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get sick work done for fair prices
my feet and legs are so soft and pretty
the forced tipping
it looks like my hair was colored 2 months ago rather than 2 days ago because of the huge gap left by my roots where he didnt put any color  he was too scared to go near the roots because he was afraid of the color bleeding into the scalp a problem ive never had the numerous other times i have highlighted my hair
after losing weight they have helped me continue my transformation with my body and skin
average is such a wonderfully useful word but in this case could only honestly describe the cut i received
the interior was very simple very white
all very methodical
anyway i wont be returning here and i suggest if youre in the market for a high price salon you look elsewhere as the price does not reflect the quality given
nikki also explained to me how to style it on a day to day basis and what products i should use
i now refuse to go anywhere else
in my experience they never answer but i do get a call back pretty quickly
unfortunately the quality of the manicure was truly dismal
the price is similar to our hometown massage price nothing like the big hotels charge
a more up to date scheduling system is needed
the nail job itself came out good as far as the color went
i called and made an appt before i walked in
rubys service is abominable and the salon itself should be evaluated for the safety of their customers
the straight razor to the necksideburns is something i really like
after about a minute or two she came over
my wife and i have gone to several reflexology places and this is by far the best one we have been to
coloring my hair has not been met with very good results
after explaining to him and personally showing him the website we booked through guarantees a strip view picture and in writing for that cost he doesnt help at all
love their service and their gel nails are the best quality and price
so far there was no place to sit and the stylist im seeing is just starting to cut the person ahead of me
one of my favorite places to shop when visiting madison
tony cut my hair first and it was the best haircut i had ever had
they dont waste your time and can do any shape you ask for its pretty spectacular
i walked inside and was immediately hit by that nail salon smell of acetone and other strong chemicals
the staff was excellent room was spacious clean and quiet
the biltmore location is great
super fun to talk to
the haircut started and then the barber wad pulled away to buy an i phone
emma always does an amazing cut and colour and she has great style  which helps when i dont know what i want
i got my mothers name on my arm in a script not only did it not take any more than 30 minutes but the lettering came out better than i hoped
i use tiffany and love the job that she does
be prepared to sleep on a mattress that feels like a rollaway bed
in a nutshell they did not disappoint
also they give you jelly bellys at turndown
after this earthquake inside settles i felt as if i went into a state of metamorphosis and ensured proper balance between rest nutrition and action over the following days
i have not had any acknowledgement or response
when she was done and asked for my approval i said it looked lumpy its a duochrome polish so the lumpiness is enhanced and she attempted to fix it by putting on more topcoat
when i went to pay i noticed and made her refile my fingers so they were even and presentable
none of them would even crack a smile and i was super nice to them
we were tired so we did without that night
give damons a try
charlie was fantastic
its confusing to get to as there is like an airport type loop that has multiple splits to ariathe stripvdaraetc
i really cant believe it i had gone to another place years ago had no pain while having the treatment done and i still have no hair growing back but my poor daughter had to endure unbelievable pain and still has full on hair
i highly recommend anyone that wants a great massage to go here
either get rid of the trainers desk area or make the studio room smaller or move the stretching equipment and tables to another location
its a great feeling and im very satisfied
ill be sure to mention something next time i see her but i wanted others to see this as well
now i can sleep in extra 10 mins everyday
tthis place is ok i only came here because qua had no more appointments open on a busy weekend
i was happy i chose her as my artist
the staff is quite perky and enthusiastic
look no further
my poor toe looks grosss have gross staff coming from itits really really painful
love this concept
it is supposed to take an hour not 25 hours
its also the longest and healthiest it has ever been
the salon is very clean and the staff is always a pleasure
after natalie worked her skillz it looks beyond what i could have asked for
deserves 0 stars
looking at them this morning the nails that actually are missing polish near the cuticle and on the sidesbad job  dont think i will go back
plus my hair looks great
dr hruby is caring and thorough and so knowledgeable you know youre in good hands from the minute you walk in
always do a good job with a smile
their wonderful waterfall showerheads and stone tiles had such an open relaxed feel to it
ive been there a few times and each time ive been impressed with the thoroughness and attention to detail they pay to their work
1 out of every 5 is free i love this place
her attention to detail is impeccable
the service friendly  prompt if needed
the therapist was amazing and she was a real help at reccomending the right products for me
i absolutely loved this place and i will definitely be back
as son as you enter the spa the aromatic eucalyptus smells gives it a nice relaxing feel
spent the weekend there for a girls trip great service from the front desk restaurants and spa
so cutting image now known as image salon parktowne llc was my lucky choice
honestly i hadnt heard good things about prenatal massage in general  its too gentle doesnt really do anything etc
ive spent hundreds of dollars on a massage before at resort spas and this was way better and 13 the price
hands down the best lash service around
all great qualities for a barber working on a short attention span child
im usually pretty nervous about trying new haircut locations i just tried this place and had an awesome experience linda is an allstar stylist
the tools did not seem to be pre packaged or clean
the shop itself is fun and relaxed which is great for me since im not a fan of the stuffy hoity toity salon vibe
overall its a nice neighborhood salon
when i went to checkout there was some problem with the credit card machine
she was very friendly and did a great job
he always has a smile on and helps so much
why provide hard earned money to a place that blatantly disrespected me
anyone that can make the train wreck on top of my head look good deserves a 5 star rating
i was told i had missed my appointment
he took his time and i was beyond happy with the outcome
my sisters and my nails turned our amazing and two weeks later my gel is still perfect
for a big group we decided on the princess suite which has a full kitchen and a balcony only worth it if you choose the strip view
will not be coming back care ever again
this will be my place of choice having just moved to the area
the haircut i received here was amazing and the mvp treatment that was very relaxing
i cant imagine going anywhere else
my 5 mo old has had a couple of scratches and red marks on him but im pretty sure he did it to himself
i was so happy to be here after 4 other nail salons with 5 s disappointed me for either not answering their phone telling me to come in later or telling me they cant take me due a wedding partythen they shouldve closed shop and put a sign up
heres the best partthe wax they use makes it almost painless
and she has a toddler and a husband and a full time job
so after my review below mickey the owner asked me to come back in for a free massage considering my experience last time
amazing place with amazing workers and customer service
for several reasons i wish i could give zero stars    cons 1  they used nyc nailpolish 99cent store here we come
20 per day resort fee
and i have never stayed anywhere that had such excellent fitness facilities
trisha is very responsive to my needs remembers i am coldnatured so my table is always toasty warm when i get on it
i walked in and they 2 females and 1 male assumed in a different language that i just wanted a pedicure
the tickly sensation at first brought me to immediate laughter but then you get used to it and it then becomes relaxing
at the end i let them know i wasnt very happy and one of the supervisors came over and looked at my nails and said oh yeah its cause our top coat we use is weird and dries weird well i think they look great
i was referred to karra at gelousy  now i wont go anywhere else
my hair looks like a blonde skunk just a strip of highlights down the middle and none on sides
i highly recommend misty and think you should give her a try
my hair turned out perfectly so good in fact i couldnt help myself and i gave latonya and big hug and immediately made my next appointment to come back in 6 weeks
i was ready to bolt but was halfway though a pedicure
however overall i am pleased that the laser was effective in getting rid of most of the scarring
i try to take care of my lashes and it definitely helps with making them last longer
then she was trying to sell me on eyebrow tattoos and eyelash extensions
that tells me customers mean nothing
price is fair and i think in this situation its exactly what they say  you get what you pay for
i will not be rebooking at this location
they do have a large parking garage
he told me i could come back in a week to put the purple back in my hair
i have been getting my xtreme lashes lash extensions done by stephanie at body by steph since march
this place is amazing youve got everything you need in one location
they all wear gloves most of them wear surgical masks
so i picked up the swatch she gave me to choose from and compared it to what she had put on my nails
judy was the lady who did my nails
heated massage table aromatic oils hot stones need i say more
by doing this he was able to receive feedback from me without either of us uttering more than a few words which ensured the trance was never broken
in fact our last trip was with another couple and they also enjoyed it
draconian return policy
they call you 2 days prior to your appt and never have a problem with changing your appts which i do often
i get it stuff happens it does i was angry that i was being dismissed
she was soaking for a good 30 minutes
hallways  change room smell mustier than ever  poor hallway lighting evokes the feeling theyre either hiding a murder scene or theres no need for light as there are no guests while doormen no longer feel that opening doors for those that do show up is part of their duties
tons of color selections
she listens suggests ideas and follows through with amazing work
she took so much time with me making sure the colors match my hair perfectly
we went up there to see what was going on and she even gave us attitude as if we were wrong
i used to frequent this shopping area quite a bit and even set foot in this store when it first opened
id give 20 stars if i could
i will never come back here again
i was very impressed and will return again
thank god access was only 13 a pop
the only thing i didnt like about this salon was the dust that was on many of the surfaces
i have never had a bad experience
when i came in to buy the pink and nude colours i was told something like actually anyone can pull off any colour and i strongly disagree
the girl at the front desk came in during my massage to talk to the lady who was massaging me and they started chatting for a couple moments which was annoying
its hard to resist after getting a massage because youre so light headed
i could not be happier with my experience
my nails always look very polished  pun intended  and i always get exactly what i want
the shop itself is very inviting the products kevin murphy davines are some of my favorites if you dont have oi oil get some now
it just doesnt fit in anyone or any business much less a small one like this one
secondly theres marion  the spa attendant
it was very relaxing
also had a promotional sign saying any ilotion you get a free face lotion
the best foot spa
people have mentioned that it takes longer to get it done by a student and while that is true my haircut from me walking in to me leaving took 70 minutes
obviously thats the last i heard of her ever
rest easy nudity is not allowed here
i was in town for only two days and needed a haircut
also no more infused water
not too long ago i pulled a muscle in my neck whilst standing up dont ask
its larger than it looks from the outside
i showed her a photo on my phone of a style that i saw on pinterest  told her that i want something similar but to do what she thinks will look best
although i must say this place does a better job than the places in los angeles
i didnt give you my personal cell phone number so that you could remind to make an appointment for a haircut
in the past ive told my stylists to just trimdust the very ends of my hair since im trying to grow it out
i was all too concerned that by my fiancee dragging me into a nail salon that my man quotient would drop immensely
i have been to quite a few spas in my day and this is probably at the bottom of the list as just an aok spa
i absolutely loved mood swings when i lived in phoenix
she was able to bring each persons beauty out in their own way and is very experienced with all skin types and colors
they spend the first 20 minutes of the half hour massaging you and the next 10 you sit with the cups on
the pool closes at sunset so the crowd has just enough time to shower change and then head to old town for the evening
i now know what are the calorie counts of food i eat
its been several weeks and the pain i had is complete gone
the girl i had was rather quiet bland not very friendly and not happy to be there it seemed
scott did my tattoo and my wifes
i will never go back there again they only had one lady doing nails she was working on five people all at one time she cut my fingers in three different places we were there a total of two hours just to get nails and a pedicure
even though i was flying out of vegas that evening i figured i would try to see if i could schedule with him anyways and sure enough he was able to squeeze me in right before my flight
i ended up flipping mine over and striking it firmly while holding the shadows in my other hand to avoid them from falling to the ground and shattering
florencio has great attention to detail
joey was my stylist
i was because the callous scraper was mentioned to be painful so i asked her to not use it
that was a major plus for me not having to worry about my makeup during my wedding
and the guy told me senator mccain went there just for cut as he has an apartments in the vicinity at camelback
in only 4 processes and deep conditioning treatments my mothers hair is almost perfectly blended into her grey and her hair is less frizzy and split and she is happier than ever
we then moved to the back of the shop to have hair wash and head massage
i certainly wont go there
she kept saying how its not her fault because she didnt label the bottles
i went to dean of shady side based on yelp reviews and its as awesome as it gets
the cleanest  most professional spa in the valley
they should be fortunate to have customers walking in and them having a job
i had a really bad ombre done at another salon and i wanted to get it fixed so i was booked the appointment with kait
this time i was completely bowled over by the service and staff at bellair
kim does a great job
namaste studio offers all levels of instruction from introductory vinysana yoga to advanced personalized ashtanga
finally they gave up and told me next time you need to wear shoes you can go home with wet nails
the husband waited patiently in the front reading his kindle while his wife had her nails done
their place is small and cute and the employees are all super friendly and funny  the music was nice and upbeat also they have a cool point system
the girls are so nice and knowledgeable
however going to someone new like i did can be risky
everyone is so friendly and attentive here
i would definitely recommend
i definitely recommend her if anyone needs a haircut
then the person that colored my hair didnt listen to what i wanted and did what she wanted
the room next door had the steam room and 2 showers 1 of which was broken
they do not push the cuticles back and for the pedicure there is no foot bath again they just file and change the polish for the nails
you can agonize over decisions or you can just do them when the time feels right and i picked door number two
the rooms are ultra modern and as you can see from some of my pics fantastic
like i mentioned earlier ray doesnt use oils because his technique is quite flawless
that thing is amazing
i called them back they said they dont remember discussion about this
call in advance to book an appointment
throughout the time i been coming here i have notice the a change in staff
they really spoil you here
clean place and he was very knowledgeable
we each dozed blissfully and passed the remainder of the afternoon partaking in a travel scrabble game we brought along played at one of the tables on the upper deck by the fireplaces before rejoining civilization
consistently great service from all hotel staff from the front desk to the bartenders
wonderful service great prices flexible with appointments and walkins improved interior
i will look beautiful on my wedding day because you gave my hair everything it needed and gave me great advice and positivity to move forward with
i would definitely recommend her to my friends and family because she is amazing and i get a discount for every referraleven better
he is rated one of the best in vegas for a reason
at 28 years old i thought id take the final plunge and get a brazilian wax for the first time
the services were average and the groupon price was right
let me warn this is when things get really weird
this wednesday i got my hair trimmed by sarah and it was probably the best experience i have ever had
she went through my email essentially told me why i was incorrect to make such statements
and literally it is a motel
i would stay here again even despite the resort fees of 28 a day
my chiropractor office does amazing massages for 55 so ill be going there
she was professional knowledgeable and friendly
both times i sweat my ass off but it felt great
i have been coming here for a few years already and cant imagine what my unruly eyebrows would look like wout mercis help
its a combination pub and barber shop
lastly im pretty sure that goodlife absolves themselves of allany liability regarding injury on their premises when you sign up so they cant get sued
when i got back to the hotel and finally checked in the room was an absolute nightmare
im so happy i finally found a regular permanent place to go to
found this place on yelp and thought id give it a try
the upstairs workout center has treadmills with tvs a yoga room with a light up blue and a sky full of stars ceiling reference to the coldplay song a sky full of stars
now i realized she did not take her time to do a good job
im not kidding
that should have been my first warning
someone even walked by and asked to take a pic of my hair because she wanted hers done that way
so this year we tried another
on the times that my appointment time did stick i always had to wait a long time to get my nails done
we unexpectedly stumbled upon this place because we went to eat next door and loved the place
yelp 2014 365 review challenge 30
i left without buying anything
best massage i ever had after long night if partying  definitely come again
i held my review until i saw my results i am extremely satisfied with my outcome
always willing to help
i went there 20 days ago for botox
great location great employee but extremely filthy the dust level on everything was thick
i went in his office thinking i wanted abnormally larger breastsi mean if youre going to pay for it why not make it noticeable
and is a pro at doing stiletto nails
they are so friendly and health conscious there about the chemicals in hair products
from the minute i walked in to this establishment i never was greeted or asked about what service i would be recieving gel polish change
i thought that was pretty convenient
just got a nose piercing with him
the showers were divine tea lounge multiple baths in the arctic room theres ice chips you can use to exfoliate
sum my hair came out decent
shes the only one who does it in the shop to assure consistency
the last 6 months or so they have started to decline
do you want massage
i dont know if its because of my groupon price that i was treated so poorly but i will never return or recommend anyone to go to elis
i was her last client so she sat with me by the dryer complete with a massage chair
they had run one through my insurance but not the other
wan  lyn rock this place
his next appointment arrived so he sent me over to halee who did my nails
she took an interest in me as a person i like when the tech takes an interest in me
no win no lose
i was impressed with the room and what it came with 2 full bathrooms one with a jacuzzi and tv and has a section that is catered to everything a woman needs
keep in mind that this place does have tables but they are better with the massage chairs
never write reviews but felt this is deserved
i got a spa pedicure and a gel manicure
i contacted their corporate office to request a refund over a week ago and no one has gotten back to me
after the first time i tried lacy out i knew id been getting the wrong people to wax me
the scents they use for massages are wonderful
they offer a wide range of wellness services skin care treatmentprocedures laser hair removal and more
a very honest review they offer you 10 off your service if you give them a positive yelp review but i purposely waited so i could give an honest review
your privacy at the counter is not a concern of theirs this is a reflection of their field management team rude as well
my nails had been so bad since i went to a nasty nail salon on amigo and windmill that were very rough not thorough and basically destroyed them with the gel they used
now on top of getting a bad pedicure now the owner was not being truthful about who she employs at her business
and to top it off the staff is amazing too
i live in chicago and the staff made communicating so easy
but overall its great and it feels good
the waiting area outside is a bit over the top with buddhas and chandeliers etc
i will ask for her every time i am here now
no sorry nothing
i did notice the quiet area sign
tom takes the time to cut your hair exactly as you want it and uses timeless technique to do it
the plus is there is no chemical smell like other nail salons do
professionally done with a smile
i wanted to be done with that place
she will take great pride in your hair style
i was seen in about 10 min and everyone was super friendly
heres a note to the salon  people are not necessarily connected to their email accounts like they are their phones
highly recommended from a chick that is very finicky over her hair
thia was awesome
she truly costumized it to my skins needs
im pretty happy with them
was my first time tanning so i have nothing to compare it to
i really wanted to walk away and not pay for my cut because it was that bad
where she started fidgeting around in her trikestroller
slightly pricey but then again it isnt walmart
in this case i decided to buy a three pack  and it was a great price
the shop isnt even close to me and i am still willing to make the trek to see him
when i asked her if shed fix it she nodded yes then left and began a pedicure for another client
shame on them
im definitely hooked and cant wait till my next visit
the whole staff was friendly and personable
my stylist was christina who is somewhat new to the business
whenever i am feeling stressed or need to relax i make an appointment at grace
i made an appointment for an all over color and trim and was scheduled with james
they run out of large towels randomly
they have a very relaxing and quiet tea lounge with magazines
im still jet lagged from my flight and did not bother making a big fuss
the robes spa slippers and anything you might need are at your fingertips
i would consider myself somewhat of a colonic veteran as i have been receiving colonics for about 10 years and have been to about 10 different facilites across the country
i tan at ft apache and i love it
the first time i visited i had a microdermabrasion treatment with joanie
listen ive been getting my nails done for almost 20 yearsn ive been all over pittsburgh to find the right salon
cost is reasonable
im so glad that i stumbled upon this gem
we filled out our paper work while he went to the back to get stuff ready
i was looking to transition to blonde
did i accidentally step into an invisibility cloak when i came in
for those who are not aware eyebrow treading has been practice forever in india and the surrounding country
also the doctor cant remember her name was extremely kind gentle and kept asking if i was feeling alright while working on my face
one of my favorite place in cleveland
wish they had more polish to choose from but its okay
also had to do several touch ups at home afterward because obvious spots were missed
i just went in for a quick eyebrow wax before i went on vacation and it was a nightmare
i should have known that if i called a hair salon and needed a quick appointment that i shouldnt go to the person who had two appointments open in the next hour
while in scottsdale visiting my family for the holidays i decided to take some time and touch up my roots for new years eve so i went to walmart and purchase a box of hair color
instead they took what looked like an acrylic nail and started popping the polish off each nail and i could definitely feel it pulling on the nail bed
my hair looked beautiful and my makeup was outstanding
we stayed in the palms tower and not spa tower as other reviewers recommended but were nonetheless very pleased with the size and amenities that our room offered
hmmm yeah no
the staff is experienced professional friendly and extremely talented
with short hair im back already for a tune up and again had a great experience
she was a chatterbug which is nothing negative except she needs to understand that not all clients are alike
this salon is always busy but they have a system where they get you in and out which i truly appreciate
well it is probably not a good idea for someone from out of town to just go running around madison
kevin does all my work and its killer
without her i would be a hot messunmanageable hair with gray coming in on the top no less and a kinky thin texture my aborigine hair
it was the perfect tattoo and it wouldnt have been so without her killer eye and great attitude
i need to find a barber thats charges only 16 for a haircut
its definitely a place to consider for our next visit
like an idiot i trusted her
by far my favorite spa in pittsburgh
i absolutely love it and have gotten nothing but compliments
when i arrived i was told that i could not use the voucher for anything other than the keratin treatment and that if i chose to have another treatment i would have to pay an additional 45
it was good
eventually i was able to compose myself enough to ask him if he really thought i was the first hiv positive person to walk into this shop and get a tattoo
ill definitely keep it in my nail salon rotation
they definitely need customer service training
i promised this time around i would get my pedicure done here and i did and i knew it was going to be a bad experience and it was
this was my first time trying something like this and i was very happy with the results
best nail place in phoenix
i recently moved to las vegas and have been in search of a new hair stylist
when i went to see alper i was a mess
i wasnt in a huge hurry and still waiting for the manager
i always get the 1 hr foot massage which to me is really wonderful
i have referred spectrum to many of my friends and they are also happy with the level of care that spectrum provides
i have crappy real nails which is why i get gel in the first place
first of all i showed up at 1020 am and although their sign said they opened at 1000 the lights were off and the door was locked
whatever a guy needs this place has it
you have a female relative  friend you dont know  like and need to buy her a gift for her birthday  xmas  funeral as soon as possible
i opted for the adder of a scalp massage im completely bald
beautiful facility and uniquely designed
absolutely love this place
i avoided these nice shiny clean fitness clubs and instead went to divey prison yard type gyms where the hardcore lifters went
once the switch was made we were not disappointed with the room or view
the salons looked clean there was no staff for walk ins
i had my session it did not hurt
this shop has a great atmosphere which allows to relax while you watch tv or enjoy the fun conversations the barbers carry on with their clients
owner joanne goes out of her way to make sure her nail place offers the best quality and service
ive bleached my hair before and have never ever had this issue
i have been to tons of nail salons and never really find a place i like but i love scottsdale nails
the 25year old wannabe hipsternonhipster typical vegas type seemingly not too clever
shanez refused to answer me i asked about 5 more times this very simple question and the bitch said dont make me mad  i guess she thinks that its just ok to rip off the elderly and push them out the door before they get a chance to say anything
i respect and appreciate that
i wasnt impressed and i agree with charles js review
they got my wife lookin amazing
id give 5 stars but i tend to save 5 stars for places ive been more than once so that i can vouch for consistency
was there for the christmas day brunch
the atmosphere is definitely not my usual salon but everyone was in good humor
hes very thorough explains everything follows up with his patients and shows a genuine care for each individual patient
wow this place has really gone down the toilet
i have to say that after 2 years of trying many places ive found my guy
thank you joni
the transfer was offered as a resolution to be able to manage the stop payment option until i use some of my services
they staff is very friendly and thorough and no one tries to talk too much
i wish i could give 0 stars attitude everywhere
not a relaxing or enjoyable experience
once we got there we were thrilled with the decor and atmosphere of the place
walked in without an appointment around 4pm on friday and got the last time slot of the day
but i understand they are busy
i gave him my basic requirements and he just ran with it
she kept ordering me around and it didnt feel comfortable
we came from tucson to get my daughters first hair cut
if youre looking for a good clean tattoo shop this place is great
its extremely hot in the summer in vegas and they kindly offered me cold water which helped out immensely
the two women who did our nails were nice but the lady who worked on my friends nails was much more meticulous taking time to make sure she was happy with everything
the day of my appointment i was so exhausted beyond tired i hadnt slept at all since i work grave hours and went in not really sure what i wanted
it has been four days now and i am amazed at the change in my skin
but i had to call my insurance company  when i called them they needed to talk to the pharmacist obviously duh its not my job to call the insurance company thats why we have pharmacists because the customers arent necessary we cant do anything
totally loved this salon on my first visit
your feets soak in an herbal bath and unlike normal places where they leave you for 10mins she spends this time giving me an excellent neck and shoulder rub
first of all this is not a resort
i love it here
i have never left his chair dissatisfied with my cut or color
the supervisor then says that she didnt even say anything but it was all in her body language and how she was hovering over with her clipboard
mary did my brows and they look awesome  very natural and clean
she has very reasonable prices compared to others and ive been to fewi will definitely recommend her to my friends and family
everyone else seems to apply it on you and thats it
thanks so much brent
no one knows the policy and they are breaking the law telling people they are sol about getting the posted price
i know then that the knots are going to be worked out
mentioned that there was still dirt under a nail and the tech said it was my natural nail
my recommendation is that if you have severe pigmentationmelasma then consider doing it on just those spots and not the whole face which was suggested to me by the personnel at bellair
my last visit i told to receptionist i just need to repair one nail and change colorafter that nail master started drilling all my nails without asking meas a result i was late to workbecause she took 15 hour drilling my nailsextra charges for refilling all my fingersand in the end they blocked me as a customerby the way lady who did my eyebrows there was amazing
very professional made me feel comfortable and walls you thru everything very comforting
i was willing to paya bit more for this hotel becaue it represents itslef to be an all suitehotel
this is an original work of art by keith
solar nails was my first nail salon  spa experience where my feet and hands were cared for simultaneously
lastly i would recommend making an appointment
i was disappointed that it took three tries on my part to get my request in
ladiesdont even hesitate to book an appointment
crazy low  prices
i love dianne shes awesomesauce
i chose the beer pedicure which is very moisurizing
you cant go wrong and the price is very competitive to others
we picked this our based on yelp reviews for nail salons near us after breakfast at emmas country kitchen
i tried searching on dryer vent cleaning near tucson and near phoenix in order to give him the review that he deserves and northstar did not turn up
ich wurde immer freundlich empfangen und nach hinten in den behandlungsraum gefhrt
when asked how long the wait is they consistently underestimate it i believe they will tell you whatever you want to hear just so you will stay
i  highly recommend nina for all your hair needs
um this isnt a crazy request
2 hours later multiple consultations with the guru and 45 later i realized i probably couldve gotten a better haircut at top cuts
danielle was terrific
no problem plenty of personal trainers at affordable prices
with that said i dont expect a spa experience  its not a spa
over time she learns the quirks of your hair
she has worked miracles on my difficult skin issues i feel that my skin has become clearer smoother and healthier looking
went to redeem my two massages and complimentary drink
i went here a couple of months ago because my cousin recommend this place
why i didnt get up and leave at that point is beyond me
we found this salon and decided to give it a try
i normally dont like massage chairs but while older their chairs were wonderful
instead she just started to put nail polish over the now rough and scary looking area until i stopped her and asked her to redo it
just found my new nail place and nail girl
pros  clean comfy leather recliners
everyone really is very friendly which just makes everything that much more relaxing
more like 2 stars honestly
i highly recommend glimpse and cant wait to go back
i call today to return the table and had the intense misfortune of speaking with two managers
the entire service was rushed and uncomfortable the woman next to me who got the basic pedicure was still being massaged by the time my entire service was finished mind you we sat down at the same time
totally forgot the name of the guy but he was super sweet professional and fast
there was no time to go back and when we called there were no apologies or efforts made to compensate for a crying bride
the massage was very quick but i guess its ok
i cant wait to go back for my next make over
at the end of the massage i was shown towards the fancy showers that had several water jets on both sides one large shower head on top and also one handheld shower head if i choose to use it
my experience at mins has been a great one
if i actually lived here in vegas i would go here all the time
i have gotten so many compliments each time she has done my hair and makeup
just a tip you might want to work on you attitude if you are going to be in customer service
thank you christina for not only making me feel pretty and fabulous but also styling me to look as good as i feel
however in the interest of customer service and retention do i believe frank was fair
ive had friends go other places for laser who are so surprised when i show them my results they cant believe it
definitely worth going for a relaxing time
hes a master at what he does and a total sweetheart
he has been doing hair for 25 years so i figured it was fine
i am so happy to have her and now i cant ever leave arizona even if i want to
i have been here a few times when i am in las vegas and will continue to visit when i need a perfect mani and pedi
i came here today for my first time and i have to say it was the best haircut i have gotten
my roots were bad
nicolina was also great and was on point with my makeup
i highly recommend hands on healing you will not be disappointed
prices are resonable too
not impressed at all with the way this was handled
best haircuts i have ever had
from what i can remember about my disappearing return reviewi walked out with orange hair when i asked for blonde
i visit lavida in shadyside every 46 weeks for a massage with allegra
they have rentals and items for purchase for costume parties holidays whatever and party favors for kids and adults too
if you are a large person they have absolutely no way of accommodating you
i had a continuous pain in my lower back past few weeks and due to weight lifting in the gym i had knots everywhere but aarti took her time to smoothen out the knots and relax my muscles
it was my first time for a full set and i absolutely love it
also  one of the only places that made me pay for the tax for the groupon
ive been here several times and everytime its never the same price and the people dont know the price they always have to call someone the owner i assume and clarify what price was agreed upon
i had to book an appointment a week ahead of time due to their busy schedule
my fiance and i did not feel respected by him
my first experience at a nail salon was sooooo shitty and thankfully on my second try at a place  i was tremendously satisfied
i usually leave a salon feeling good about myself but i left goa feeling pretty crappy
i get gel nails the 2nd to last time the gel was peeling of within 2 days the last time the girl grinder too much what happened to foil removal
well gee you didnt have anyone before me and come to find out she didnt have anyone after me yes im your next client
so my 4 star review honestly was a stretch
if you are thinking about checking out this salon i would highly recommended it and tisha all the way
after we checked in my husband came over and said wow
i would recommend these girls over and over again
but when the female started she didnt ask me what my preference was and just started the massage
the ambiance is serene tranquil and peaceful
i get sore knotted up muscles and she undoes all the damage
as soon as i got there the owner asked me what i needed pedicure he personally cleaned and disinfected the spa chair and tub where i was going to be helped
this experience left a really bad taste in my mouth and i was really not impressed with how we were treated
trish is the first and only nail tech i have had since moving to chandler
ive probably received over 75 massages from these various foot spas not to mention ive been getting weekly massages from my chiropractors office for 13 years so i know a thing or two about massages
i dont normally write reviews on here but since i was so excited based on some of the other reviews i wanted to share my experience
i waited 15 minutes to finally be helped
not quite 2 months and wrinkles are back
unfortunately  my circumstances have changed and i am going to be further away  other wise i would have done weekly  regular appointments
literally no one cares
very clean and very nice atmosphere
never have to wait long either
just dropped in for the first time to get my bio gel redone and im really impressed
i was going to everybodys hair for about a year or two when the hairdresser i always asked for left
pay attention to where you go we write reviews for a reason
i personally love her service you will not be dissapointed nor will you go back to wherever you used to wax at
with quality product and her great technical skills my nails are finally in good hands
she cut my hair way to short 1 inch over shoulder and made layers on 2 inches
a couple of days later i get an email saying nope i got my trial and so no refund and we are still good to go for 111111  i called her told her that she has a ridiculous business practice
i think she put me in a trance because before i knew it an hour and a half had passed by
even when she does designs i know it wont take forever to do
i paid 35 for a crappy full set of nails
if you are looking to be rowdy and run wild where you are staying this is not the hotel for you
im excited to go back
its not a destination hotel of course but we find it convenient to stay in to visit family and friends nearby
we had plenty to eat and plenty to drink
yes the price is a little steep but completely worth it
so i guess i will be bringing my companion back soon for manicure and pedicure very pleased with their excellent service
kamilla is amazing i left with a flirty and fun haircut thank you
they didnt have much opi and i always choose that for my toes because it lasts the longest
this is worth spending your time and money on
i highly recommend jen for any hair needs
while reaping the wonderful benefits of a 40minute session
she is being rough with my daughter
i got a massage from a new girl thats been there about 6 weeks  she did an awesome job even though it was only 4045 minutes long
as good as it gets
he truly is concerned with your entire experience i encourage everyone to see him or at least consult with himyou will thank me later
well i wish i would have known that before your technician cut me and started on my nails
and for the professional cut that you get thats cheap
i love his work and he has the nicest staff ever
i was getting good cuts but nothing greatall slight varients of the last one
ive been coming for about a year and half and after yesterdays exchange i will be happy to take my business elsewhere
i have long very curly ethnic hair that i now love because of pam
the results are amazing even better than i could have expected
emily should probably pack up her scissors too
having cyrus behind the cash register is a waste of his time
i will definitely be coming back here
the main technician judy was short tempered and non accommodating
nur die qualitt der verarbeitung lsst zu wnschen brig
this time it did the same 4
although it was after hours my call was returned within twenty minutes
they do use products that are gentle on the hair as i was told
tried the salon this morning and really liked it
so you know i trust these guys
nails look beautiful
the place was full and very busy however according to the guy that didnt my nails joe was his name i believe this was one of their slow days
oh it felt amazing
try them im sure you will agree
they told me there was another location so i decided to go there
the casino is nice and clean
furniture is getting dirty old and worn down
shila is absolutely sweet and amazing
if you are looking for a new place for anything for any type of hair go here
lashes last such a long time and the integrity of my natural lashes is never compromised
perfectly decent nail salon
she colored my hair in a shimmery offset pattern that is just stunning i get so many compliments
the nice lady on the phone said they never called you
if you give her small changes to your haircut then she always listens and ensures you are happy
they also have a spa there with massages but the hours for the massages seem hit or miss
she brushed out all of my hair and restarted
i had to do half the job my self
got my very first tattoo today
nicos mom and grandma go to vks so i gave them a try
no hidden prices just good artists doing there thing
it has a charming luxurious french flare
friendly and professional
if youre a hotel guest you can get the day pass whenever
it was not the treat i had hoped for at all
i decided i was ready to try a brazillian for the first time
the rooms are nice and they have enough good places to eat
beli did my scalp facial and she a super fun to talk to also
they got me in the same day i called and took care of me
i completely understand about being on time for appointments so your specialist doesnt run behind for her next appointment but i know its normally a 10 minute mark and not 4 minutes
looks like i will need to spread the word dont go to his nail salon
trying all day to schedule surgery for melanoma
it definitely lives up to the hype
at the recommendation of a friend i found a fantastic stylist somewhere else who said whoever cut my hair gave  a standard non experienced cut that works against  curly hair
few reasons why i will be a loyal customer for years to come
ive had sns on my nails for a week and i love it
this takes time
the manicure chairs are very very worn
biana did my pedicure french tips im usually very particular but i walked out happy and will be back the next time im in arizona
upon arriving the staff was extremely friendly offering me their list of services and something to drink
the technicianowner is always nice polite and respectful and they always work with my crazy hectic schedule
as she styled it it just wasnt me
each lady got exactly what they wanted and looked stunning
just trying to file them down and repaint them myself
the end result was brassy red orange blonde terrible looking highlights
darque tan offers monthly memberships as well as prepaid packages i use the 3388month package that allows for unlimited tans in level 1 and 2 beds at any dt location
thank you ladies satisfied customer
on top of my time being disrespected she implied that i am also a thief
the pillows didnt have one stain on them the towels were absolutely wonderful
if you want quality work you have to see nick
i agree with all of the other 5star reviews
and the quality of work has always been wonderful
if you want to have a fun experience you wont find it here
i went to the pampered pinkie as a mno moms night out with my former momgroup in mesa
even as i sat there and hemmed and hawed about what i wanted and which extra machine and foot pedal was a good deal
the were kind and stated they would get right back to me
i highly recommend dr sutton and his new staff at his new location
next i went and selected my polish from the wall
the best atmosphere
franks barber shop was my go to place for so long dont get me wrong there are 1 or 2 good barbers here but the customer service and wait times are horrible
i hadnt been to a barbershop in like 3 years or something
the entire place seemed like putting a coat of paint on a neglected run down outhouse so you can charge people for the dubious privilege of visiting
my eyes were already teary because he shampooed my hair so rough that the application soiled water was all over my face
i would easily recommend this place over some of the fancier and pricier spas in aurora
each of our tattoos took sal about 20 mins to complete
i went there to get a haircut by angela usually i am not quite sure what i want to do with my hair but thanks to her i have a fresh easy to style cut that i will probably keep for the summer
you get the same prescription even month yet they never once have it in stock always 23 days to get it
alchemy was quick to provide incredible customer service by offering a solution
sara is amazing
if you have a choice choose this shop
so i give them 1 star for the lashes
the reviews didnt seem too bad so i gave it a try
are top notch and i dont have one bad thing to say about our threenight stay
i called to get the last month refunded to me and i have now spoken to people 3 times they will not give the number for a manager or their corporate billing person they just say they will email them and have them contact you back
i loved them and their work so much ive been back for skin care products and would refer everyone here
who charges for guest passes anymore
i dont know if they treat all customers like this or just groupon users but if their purpose for using groupon is to get new customers then they are failing miserably
i am so glad i found him
im going to dispute his with groupon since j bought botox not bullied into dysport
i dont think i could ever see myself going to anyone else
it was a real spa experience
new staff means new show offs i guess
i met my stylist dayana and she went through a great consultation
before i left we looked at what we would be doing for my next visit and honestly i cant wait
at some places youre lucky to get a 2 minute massage with a regular pedicure but jina took her time and completely made me feel pampered and relaxed
their phone number does not work and their website take you to a porn site
the add on options are quite nice and reasonably priced and a foot scrub with the massage was a bonus after long hours walking the strip
very professional company
this shop is clean tedious and friendly
i asked for more but didnt get it
did not honor yelp discount
she is unprofessional and has no idea what customer service means
annie asked me about my goals and targeted something for my sensitive rosacea prone skin
the setting came with charm
i never had this quality of facial in my life
i had submitted photos of hair and makeup styles that i was looking for classic hollywood  pin up and addressed some specific requests prior to my wedding day
she is full of suggestions if you need will look at pictures you bring in with you if you have an idea of what you want she will tell you how best to style your new cut and she is hilarious which doesnt hurt
if you are looking to have the most relaxing amazing massage and day changing experience please give lena a chance to fulfill this
west tower was newly renovated and wonderful
i was nervous but felt comfortable with troy whos first impression is super nice friendly and competent
check it out for yourself
i pass this place almost every day but i never paid much attention to it because you cant see in through the windows from the outside
rob did a fantastic job
the lady who did my nails was really nice and i would definiteely go there every day if i could
the address yelp has listed is their old address
shes my go to forever and ever
i will not be returning
staff let me know the place is familyrun with just a couple of locations
vince gets up from his station to try and rectify the situation
esther was a great girl who was able to understand my needs and answer any questions i may have
would 1000 recommend
found them while walking through shops
im seriously so upset that i wasted 30 copay on this appointment
i thought id give it a good try anyway and broaden my horizons but some of the poses seemed dangerously unsupported they make you sign an injury waiver before class and the teacher was very condescending and abrasive
after a bit more freaking out he went to some room in the back where im assuming he cooled off
but the owner is a money hungry liar
all the lipgloss actually smells like fresh berries
i pretended to get an emergency call on my cell so i could escape this place
these guys are awesome
i called in the morning hoping to get in for a massage because i was in a lot of pain
its that extra personal touch that makes alexis so special
they have always had my rx done fast and if there is ever any issues  they are responsive and return phone calls as they say they will
yes the zebra carpet is super funky but the place is clean smells good and as you barely checked in you are already offered a refreshment
sarah gives such a relaxing experience and really makes your skin glow
also without the casinos downstairs i felt truly relaxed coming home at 400am from a long night of clubbing on the strip
even the fatburger place in the food court had trouble putting  burger togetherin the east wing we had the single serve coffee makers
i may get pretty dirty taking care of the barn chores but now my hands dont have to look like it
in the last two years i have made five appointments and have had three of them cancelled and rescheduled at the last minute by his office staff
nice pool area the upstairs deck screamed of doing as little as possible to make it habitable
my husband stumbled on this new barber shop this morning
came here as an out of towner with an idea in mind for a piece
will never be back
we should therefore protest openly everything  that smacks of discrimination or slander    mary mcleod bethune i have written this review in the most respectful tone i could muster despite the intense anger and frustration that i am feeling
the first njght i tried to go i arrived at 945pm and it was locked
she is new to the salon from california and uses a natural enzyme product that makes color last longer and leaves your hair healthier
it is super clean a relaxing environment and i have had nothing but good experiences with the technicians
staff are sweethearts when you talk to them but its little details like this that seem to be slipping
the 5 stars are for luis  came to az to visit family
if you have hair worth spending 21 on ian is your guy
john is also a teacher and he has much wisdom to share
id definitely recommend the salon
i set up my next appt and my stylist booked 5 hours again
when we left my husbands aunt expressed her disgust of how her nail tech just rinsed the callus remover grater and put it back in the rotation
ashley does a great job shes amiable and ive never had anything close to an unpleasant experience here
i can assure you that marc anthony doesnt carry cheap product
after she accidentally slid the flat piece of metal under my real nail bed rather than the acrylic i got up and left
will continue to get more art done there
the same man was working but it seemed like he pushed me on to someone else
if you are looking for a true spa experience in a full service nail salon and need a place to escape reality for a little while  this is it
great atmosphere great group of dudes place is like an old fashioned type of barber shop with a sports and hollywood theme haha talk to them about any sports and theyll really get into it
kea she left the salon
in the end he was spot on right
a very cool atmosphere with a very open floor plan
to my knowledge there is a new waxologist on the team now
except for relative poverty
finally she obviously paid attention to other areas i needed to work on  she pointed out that my right leg is much stiffer than my left and gave me advice on what to do to ease that muscle tension
she cares a lot about customer service and making sure you are pleased with all aspects of your time there
really good value
best of all she is easy to schedule with
me being in business myself i feel like this was really unprofessional and that she was being deceitful
i feel that his service should have been compd or at least reduced significantly
i am updating my review as the guess relations manager has reached out to me and been very helpful
everyone was super friendly and the salon is lovely inside
i called this place and asked the lady that answer the phone if i needed to schedule an appointment she said no
they have lots of nails pics on facebook too
then preceded on telling me to go on instagram to pick out a design from there
they have bumble and bumble products which i love
not only do they sell the beautiful clothes and vintage inspired underwear id been buying online so much easier now i can try before i buy but they have a salon downstairs where they transform you into the vintage chick you always wanted be
it was a bit pricy but it was definitely worth it for the 5 hours time they put in to get it just right
nicole was recommended by a friend of mine
it was clear that clarendon staff truly care about each guest
i now trust only farida and i consider myself a brow expert
i expected better service from a level 5 stylist
i came to this place since it was in the same plaza as stylish nails
visiting from the bay area and needed some pampering before the rock and roll half marathon im pretty sure ive never made a better salon selection
i was told that i would receive a phone call in about an hour since they have it in stock etc
i had to walk around to find someone to assist me
had champagne and snacks ready when we got there
hell i didnt even bleed
im excited to have a new regular spot
tiffany the owner has a special place in my heart she is so cool and classy
emily was very professional and friendly while highlighting and coloring my hair
they were nice enough to provide me with a complimentary massage
i wish i could sit there all day
space and a fridge
ive been going to melissa for three years
everyone at pro tan usa at the shea location has been amazingly friendly and helpful
she kept a conversation and made me laugh
i have been in my hotel for a couple of hours and my mani is already peeling
melanie is who i go to and she does a great job with my curly hair
while this shop is somewhat aesthetically pleasing in that its clean sterile and semidecorated the artists employed there are what turned me off
every single time i come into a sephora im never acknowledged during the entire duration im in their store
update nancy at total bliss called to discuss my experience at the salon and went above and beyond to make sure my next experience would be better
beautiful hotel comfy beds pool is a great hang out to relax and people watch a few downsides crazy expensive food and snacks in the rooms
after she has completed her work she always asks if you are satisified and always offers to put on more lashes if you are not satisfied which never happens
i definitely recommend this place
i bought a groupon for cut all over color and style
she transformed my rather strange hairstyle into a cute classy do just in time for me to enjoy christmas
that is her greatest joy
they are amazing
dare i say as good as it gets
i wont be back
with the high celings and  ventilation the smoke isnt too bad
i ended up waiting more than an hour for this client to be done
dr hozjan never makes me feel rushed or pressured
i love this place
i hardly give lauren any direction and she runs wild with beautiful and festive creations for both acrylics and gels
i decided to try out a different lash girl the next time
in my experience you would usually expect to pay just for the jewellery but i guess you have to expect to fork out more on the strip
i have been very pleased with my new look
but i ended up having her do more while i was there so i ended up paying for the actual cost of the brazilian why i went there
i like the facemasks nose porestrips and blotting paper from this brand the most
it was really a lot of fun and a pleasure working with tom and tiffany
the right side was way longer than the left side
there is a great massage envy right down bell
we came out to vegas for a birthday and spent our day at wet republic
the lights were dimmed and there was soft elevatortype music playing in the background
cindy is amazing
i used to visit the 7th street location as a child 10 years ago and now this location is just a couple of minutes from home which is super convenient
i am still trying to decide if i will return and give a different nail tech a try or continue my search for a nail salon
but you cant really fault them too much for their location
i emailed ann and she was able to move up my appointment an hour so we would have plenty of time to try on gowns
personally i feel like it takes too long its kind of boring and its just too much work
some of my nails were not completely covered with nail polish
she is very nice and relaxed and helpful with nervousness this was my girlfriends very first
every person that works there is great
after he applied the body scrub you take a shower and rinse everything off
during the 2nd week of my 3 weeks stay i was put on the 17th floor big mistake
what happened to the time frame
i just waited until rambha came out to get coffee and just happened to ask if i was waiting for something
and master john
jackie was so sweet and very talented
do wives not make barber shop appointments
this complex tattoo was designed by doug
i needed a quick polish change on my toes
then i met milunka
johnny was my tech and he did an awesome job
the sauted onion was mushy and like something you would get at a ballpark
i am constantly getting compliments on my lashes and always fall more in love when i go for my fills
in all it was a very nice stay
love that place
i cant imagine what a third trip will do but i will likely try this place again sometime in the future
i think i found my new nail salon
i was recommended to try them out
im looking forward to seeing jenna again soon
i have had facials massage and reflexology here and have been satisfied with all
3  having a scheduled appointment does not seem to mean anything as you usually have to wait at least 20 minutes before a stylist will rush you out the door
ive bounced around and tried over a dozen barbers and nothing compared to this shop
today what a nightmare
the stylist i had must have been newunexperienced used too much product on my fine hair and i walked out with basically flat hair
they have monthly specials on various services making it an even better deal
i think shes a magician
you get what you pay for
the pedi chairs are highpowered tip the ones on the right give a much deeper massage
i only trust these guys to get my cuticles looking pretty
the salon has a great vibe too
i will say that the police that pulled me over were more polite and accommodating than the staff at massage heights
it took me an hour to be seen it wasnt even full
you do hear loud conversation at times
thank goodness i found deanna who has been doing my hair for the past few years and  i even followed her from her former salon shes that good
she lifted the dark color out of my hair and did a balayage
came here on a recommendation from my coworker
i wont be returning to this salon whenever im back in vegas
im a black female and i had heard that getting laser hair removal would be difficult for me however that has not been my experience here at satin
the service and process at lifequest chiropractic  massage was very professional and easy
ive never been so heartbroken and hurt in my life and thought i should share please please please dont try and go blonde unless you want to look cheap feel cheap and pay a lot of money for it
when she was finished  my hair was flawless
i do not recommend
the next day i received a follow up phone call asking how my experience was and if i had anymore questions
ive been a blonde my entire life except  the last year i was brunette  know a bit about how it works
the owners are so helpful and offer honest opinions  great service
ive frequented the m casino whenever i am in lv
i have to say this is the best hair experience i have had in pittsburgh
worst place ever
it was incredibly relaxing the stones were the perfect temperature the pressure of the massage was perfect
since my only painless option was to get a facial i planned to get two facials they gave me credit for only twothats a 240 facial
linda is amazing
i am now a group fitness junkie
was desperate to find a salon who could deal with fine hair
she said she would give me the price i saw online
this resort has the worst management ever
left with a beautiful cut and healthier hair
and get to you right away i just couldnt ask for anything more
if the infections persist i will be reporting this salon
i just wanted an angled cut and a bright red color
it took about two minutes
i cant wait for my pedi this week
she really made sure i was pleased with the service and gave me tips on how to fight ingrown hairs
unfortunately they booked me for the wrong massage 60 minutes instead of 90 minutes swedish instead of hot stone
the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because they always have the same cd on repeat while im there
unfortunately it was was the day before i was to go into a serious surgery
lastly they close for a week to install new carpets and cardio equipment but offer access to the tempe location
i had a pedicure by maria
i booked appointments for my mom and i during spa week
i almost feel dirty for writing this and admitting that i cheated on my regular hair dresser but i did
i will never come here again
recently moved to the area
at first i didnt go in because they were all skincare products and i wasnt technically in the market to replenish but then i decided to check it out
would never go back
attention ladies with long hair have long hair but want style without cutting all the length off
i see tiffany for my lash extensions
i love this salon
also being a hairstylist i have to have impeccable nails and thats how they always are and more
the salons interior is modern and clean
very good meal overall
the only place i go for my nail needs
ill probably use this for going out and not every day wear but something ill definitely use
i definitely recommend her
a refaire
3 out of 4 entrances have padlocks and insist you enter where you must wear a neon bracelet
he asked me what i wanted and outdid that
smoking is allowed in the casino however it does not smell like smoke
and looked completely different after healing the eyebrows essentially disappeared
my hair cut experience was with a senior stylist and she sorry i cannot remember her name was really great
she was sensitive enough to ask the right questions at the very beginning what was i hoping to get out of the facial for example
i saw a groupon offering 4900 room rate
she was running late and i was done in 40 minutes
the service here was amazing clean friendly
i love them
hoffentlich verschwindet das positive leben aus diesen gemuern nicht ganz
and damn their stuff smells good
i dont know why i keep coming to this location
this is a boutique hotel done right and we will continue to come here on our staycations
i have heard of this place through friends to get a pedicure
she used the mink volume lashes on me and wow what a difference from the ones i had previously
not to mention he completely butchered my coffin nail shape
she was not only able to fix the highlighted portion but she also fixed the tips of my hair and added toner to my hair toner was free
she was so friendly and patient to give me advises of how my nails can be done and i love the outcome
obviously you lost me as a customer but there are plenty of foot spas so no worries
the design charge depends on how difficult it is
great central phoenix nail shop
the hotel had so much to offer while my husband attended his conference
my hair would get caught in the nails
my husband and i got to share a room together which was our first couples massage and i would definitely do it again
the only thing that was really weird was that he didnt wash my hair  maybe you have to ask for that specifically
i am so excited to be on a path with vanessa to forever clear skin and i am totally counting down the days until my next appointment
sofia is a very caring esthetician and easy to talk to ask any question anytime
my mom got acylic nails that were done by the owner and she said it was the fastest and the best acrylics she has ever gotten
second i got a pink  white new full set
our massages were great and they let us schedule for later in the afternoon and stay late to use the facility
i promise this is your go to  regardless of where your hair stands now
nick and mimi are the best
stopped into this spot because it was close to my job and i needed to run out quickly
wonderful place to stay luxurious spacious amenities aplenty
i adore this studio
having gel removed from your nails is very harsh but i reluctantly came back because they were that bad
i definitely recommend this store gem its perfect
ive done my nails with kaylee and nancy
yeah youll pay 60 for a haircut but its so worth it
they took their time with everything making sure that it was done right instead of rushing it along like some assembly line
she had no problem
i sent this company an email first to discuss it and never received a response from them
dont feel romantic  get carried away lol
2 my boyfriend is very tall and his feet didnt even fit inside the buckets
i trust melissa to do anything with my hair and she never fails to do great work
haircuts all seem to go well so stick with those just not with india
i have found mine now at aura
update i went in today and had another pedicure and wow much better
ive never complained and spoken up when i havent loved my polish but this was bad
i could hear courtney laughing and they covered the phone
i had a great expierence with this salon
cool relaxing atmosphere
i told her that they would take good care of her and not only did shaunte and deja make her looking absolutely stunning on her wedding day deme and the rest of the ladies made sure that us ladies in the wedding party looked fantastic too
the blackjack tables were very generous and the buffet had good food with free wine and beer
not much of a difference i know but when im pretty sure ill be heading to a new salon to get it fixed next week that really makes me mad
my manicurists attitude was just odd almost made me wonder if he had a personality disorder
my lashes look perfect and they last because she is so good at what she does
the first session i paid hundreds of dollars and not one bit of blonde showed at all
best pedicure i have ever received
i called when she suggested and another condescending individual told me they would not receive any further quantities and was not in any way apologetic and made me feel like i was an idiot for calling
my one friend stopped her service in the middle of her stylist attempting to curl her hair because it was horrible
the woman who does eyebrows and nails is also great
this place offer great prices and awesome services
my daughter told me about this place and i absolutely love it since i found noha
thank you yelp for sending me their way
listen ladies i get it you want your nails done a certain way and you expect a certain result
she worked wonders during my first cut
the 40 off first time was the only reason why i still came when you charge 2600 for eye brow wax
i told her yes and she decided wo asking to paint a design no flower on all of my toes then hands me a bill for 50
the mistakes did not disappear
so i go to the washing station and she gives the toner to a trainee and shes teaching her how to put the toner in and when she should rinse my hair out
my last visit was a nightmare from start to finish
32016 stopped here the other night was on a mission to see what was marked down from christmas
all in all this was the first salon in cleveland i tried and i dont intend to look around anymore
food at the restaurant sucked however pricing was reasonable
loved it  walked in they did a brazilian then nails while my husband got a full pedi all professional good quality definitely going back
she was friendly and easy to talk to during the entire procedure and the best part it was pretty much pain free with all the topical numbing meds she uses before and during to ensure maximum comfort
the district manager tara was unempathetic and didnt care that their staff was rude
she cut it a little shorter than i wanted but thats my only complaint
in fact every time i walk out of the waverly everyone inquires  who does your hair
i absolutely loved the cut i got here
i love them
the lady that re twisted my hair is ashley lyke the owner of the business
no wait and an attentively cut style with a great deal of scissorsovercomb when others would likely resort to clippers
the hairstylists and nail techs will help you to look and feel at your all time best
as a healthcare professional i find this to be a complete waste of busy healthcare professionals time and also healthcare dollars
the dining room is spacious with a great view and wonderful ambiance
i was greeted in a genuinely friendly manner by a beautiful woman with a great hairstyle and fashion sense which encouraged me that she would hopefully know more than i do about the subject of hair
you can tell that absolutely everyone loves their job and their happiness is reflected in their amazing cuts and color
beautiful clean salon with some of the friendliest nicest people i have ever met
my stylist recommended that i get layers to give my hair volume i was cool with that and yes my hair does have more body now
told her what i wantedand she got started
veras is a good nail salon
my problem is the price of the groupon
i get them every 3 12 wks to realign my muscles and joints and eliminate fluid retention due to fibromyalgia
thee best massage ever very inviting sweet just a all around awesome experience
this gym is amazing
i was looking for a salon to do my hair and makeup for prom and this is was the only place where they actually picked up their phone the first time i called and were genuinely nice and enthusiastic
after looking at the first coat i noticed that he had painted over my cuticles on many fingers and the edges were very messy
hope to come back again in the future
no pre tense no attitude just a great haircut from a super nice person
great spa located in the same building of studio raw on the lower level
its endless and they are all such beautiful colors
so not only do i have a nail that doesnt even match they charged me for it and said it was my fault that my nails were old and i should have gotten a new set instead of a fill
always looking forward for my next appointment
stop price shopping and go with knowledge and experience
well went back tuesday and delia took care of me and fixed what was wrong great clips your lucky to have her as an employee she went over and beyond and spent 20 minutes and blended everything rather just cut off the bad line on back
she had been stopping intermittently during the manicure to answer her phone when someone would text her
i will never shop at this location again and suggest that anyone who expects good customer service avoid it as well
am i to be the first to write a review for someone whos been around for a long time and does an excellent job
it was basically painless
rude in person  on the phone
i am so grateful and highly recommend jody
she may be tiny but she is strong
the man on the phone who i presume is the owner said of course and to come in
she is just simply amazing
i love being able to choose the scents of lotion for the pedicures and the massage portion of the pedicure is a lot longer than the other places
i am a loyal customer of brandon since january 2011 and will go anywhere he goes
such a disappointment
i came to her with thin sad looking eyebrows and she has helped me transform them into thicker beautiful brows
i love this nail salon
if you like mullets thats great
every time i have a new idea with my color she completely nails it and makes me feel my best again
sorry but if i paid 50  tip for gel nails i dont expect them to chip within the week of getting them
he is probably a lot of clients reasons to keep coming back
not sure why they would tell me to come in right away if they didnt have time for me
really pays attention to detail
i have had two liquiduv gel fills and one pedicure at pink polish
during my 1015 minute shower the water changed 34x
i was bummed but i know that life happens so rescheduled for the following friday today 06202014 same time but an hour prior to my appointment  i got a call once again id have to reschedule do to  an emergency
maybe im just an independent shopper but i love it
fiji water and some sample products nice start i was brought into another room with a very cool swivel massage table the kid in me just wanted to spin around in it but i didnt much  the procedure itself was really nice they cleansed my face then used the microdermabrasion tool that felt like a cat licking my face
the couple beside me had the same experience they were in before me so i saw it
thank you judy
not a big deal for me other than the thumb twirling but this was not a good first impression
i dont think ill ever come back
i am going to go back to theresa to discuss doing some permanent makeup on my lips
there was no rhyme or reason to it only further proving that my hair was a disaster
i was going to buy a groupon but not now
i came in to my appointment nervous because i had really long hair but was ready for a change
we had a one bedroom condo unit that had a full kitchen and balconythe pool is excellent
we were close enough to be able to join the festivities but also able to get away from it easily and take a break when we wanted to
then to follow that fantastic massage i had a full body wrap
since it was april fools day tim even helped me prank my husband and pinned my hair as if he cut my hair super short
the service was performed in a darkened room off the main floor  so quiet  and behind a curtainedoff area
thank you for making me feel so welcome and so pretty
i told her exactly what results i was looking for with purchasing my products and she pointed me to the right ones
the salon was very busy and had a new york feeling about it
everyone is very welcoming and nice
he was very precise he will deliver exactly what you ask for and he is damn skilled at it
lori roth is excellent with color and very reasonably priced
honestly this place has good service but the quality of the nails sucks
i informed my nail technician that i had a cut on the back of my heel from my shoes and to be careful touching it
so when i told her im very experienced in groupons and i have never been required to give it for appointment she said well maybe you should get refund
my manicure took about 15 minutes and looked like crap when i was finished
to say i got a facial is an understatement
i purchased a groupon recently because i wanted a change and also i am heading out to las vegas soon for a bachelorette party
great prices very friendly
it was lighthearted and funny
she was so warm and welcoming and i am sold for life
i had gone here a long time ago and they messed up the color
first tattoo experience was great
yes but once a month or so i can afford to indulge myself in a little something
great little salon first time trying somewhere new for a lash perm with tint  was a little messy for application different from what im use to but the after result was gorgeous
i apologize to all for the winded review but im still sporting the crappy pedicure results and will be for the next five weeks
theres a huge selection of face masks as well as creams
they handled all the paperwork and mailing of the hair and even gave me a free haircut for donating
i love sephora and it is so nice to have one on this side of town
i passed by and saw the sign
the girl upfront put me on hold for quite a long time and when she finally came back she told me she cant help me because system is down and just hanged up the phone being rude
i was naked and the sheets were down at my lower back
best place ever
as soon our vacation reservations for las vegas were set  my hubby and i made tattoo appointments with joey hamilton cuz after all its not everyday you can get tattooed by an inkmaster
between the three of us we had two tattoos done as well as two us of getting pierced
i wouldnt trust anyone else to execute my less than conventional hair styles
the prices are great very in line with other nail salons
dont be fooled by the long menu listing a variety of treatments
ricky is the owner and mimi is just awesome
la salon blue earth a t mon premier endroit et jy suis alle simplement parce quils avaient de la place et le prix tait raisonnable 40 pour une coupe seulement
however the last time i bought him one he lost it and went in to ask them to look it up they write it in a book not automated at all and the receptionist huffed and puffed like it was a major inconvenience to look up a 200 gift certificate
we walk in and the place is huge
the manicurist requested payment before polishing
their pedicure tubs are jetless and look like barrels which are unique
be sure to check out groupon because they have specials deals there too
i am definitely going to be a regular customer here
i was too embarrassed to complain as the girls at the desk stare you up and down as you wait for your serviceunless youre a regular youre pretty much trash
thanks a million
no scalp rub well unless you count her rubbing the metal spay nozzle across my forehead
she uses davines hair products which are all natural
best salads and juices ever
i got what would be called a deluxe pedicure with designs on my toes for only 27 bucks
the best ive experienced
at this point i figured it would kinda be like getting a pedi
like said if you need cut get on the appointment list
i left cleveland 8 years ago but still make a point of stopping by ginos for a haircut whenever i am back in town
its the best deal around since 5 footlongs and those are no longer with us rip
there is a new colorist and hairdresser named dusty and she is fabulous
if you have to wait for waxing be patient
he even put up with all my anxious moms questions its a few bucks more than a piercing gun piercing but its so worth it for the cleanliness you get with the piercing
i love love love my lashes
the nicest people ever
giving two stars because the staff are always nice
i received a free room offer from south point last winter and took them up on it
you will leave in bliss
they have been under new management for almost a year now
shes extremely talented friendly and in my opinion will add shine to the gem that is fate image salon
on another occasion i saw them pouring generic top coat into an essie bottle when i asked for them to paint the sides of my nails which they missed the woman said in vietnamese of course that i was being difficult and the woman that originally did my nails responded that she did the acrylic too thick
all the reviews were great and i was looking for holographic polish so i drove 30 minutes and gave it a shot
oh my gosh  i am so grateful to have found jennifer
gitayou are the bomb
thank you for your convenient location and hours
i sipped on my glass of wine while relaxing and chatting with dashelle
i went for a massage and facial when i was about 4 months along and also when i was around 8 months along  both times were fantastic
she reminded me of her no tip policy and let me know that all tip money goes to drug and gang prevention classes in maricopa and surrounding areas
the cut is too deep and wide to be a mistake they just dont care about the customer and are there for a quick service
i will definitely be returning here in a few weeks
no hot stone massage even though it was supposed to be included
i love this place
was excited for a beauty bar downstairs from work but they didnt invest in the people they hire
that never happens
no smelly fumes
found the ad on facebook
william was great
in other hotels on the strip you pay for wifi but its free parking
i go to the  village sometimes 6 days per week and will even go when im not working out just to sit and do stuff on my laptop they offer free wifi or to get lunch or dinner at one of the two little cafes
it is nice to have all the options
my first goround with ear piercing had been at a claires in the mall when i was 17  my words of wisdom dont trust a teenager with a gun
let her tempt you with ideas and amaze you with results
after this last time when i experienced rudeness and poor communication with a whole lot of attitude i figured i appreciate customer service way too much to settle
when i called denise she was willing to work with me and do a touch up another time due to my concern so we set up a third appointment
i am glad i did no pay full price after the service i got
we will definitely be returning for our monthly pedicures
and i might even do that tomorrow
i loved the setting of this place each room is very private its not your typical tower hotel
the design i brought in ended up completely crooked and the glitter fade i asked for was not a fade at allthe girl just wiped the glitter on the top of my nails
i like massages with a lot of pressure and not a lot of talking and urbana was very conducive to my needs
you could ask for a towel and the staff would grab you one but i would prefer if i could get my own towel
i cannot judge her technique at cutting my hair as i am not a stylist but i will say that i have never seen it before and the service was quick
i went in there and i asked the lady if she knows how to do an eyebrow arch and i told her that my skin is sensitive please be careful  i told her if she is my skin will rip open she clearly did not listen to me
i frequent this location a lot
there are lounge chairs to sit on at anytime and usually that is where you will be called for any treatment service you may have made an appointment for
i peeked into the gym which looked very nice but i wouldve been lying to myself if i thought id be able work out after being up all night
they showed me nail same colours of there gel nails and every neutral one i picked they did not have the powder
couldnt even be bothered that much
the experience was fantastic
the whole property is so relaxing
they still have a long way to go compared to sephora
first time visiting vegas and this was our comped room for night since our flight was cancelled
the ease and convenience of being able to take my own meals with me was priceless
i do however swear by the theraputic benefits of massage
dont make me wait
unless im going to vegas to rock the strip until 5am with friends id much rather be here
the staff greeted us as soon as we entered the door
specially i purchased a service i didnt enjoy so corporate happily changed it to upgrades for the services i frequently use
looking back i obviously should have followedup with him to make sure he knew what i wanted
she sat me down in a hurry and proceeded to quickly put  only a few  foils in my head
well then i ask them ok how about if i use this 25 dollar gift certificate that you guys are offering with the groupon towards paying for that numbing cream application
the decor is nice but the stylists seem very catty and gossipy
switched a 10 table to a 5 table for us but the blackjack dealer was rusty and wasnt sure of her pay outs or bonus bets disappointing
and thank you to my stylist blue campio for taking great care with me
ashley is basically the sweetest person on the planet
the end result was better than the expectation
the price came out to less than half of what i was expecting to pay
so i fled heart pounding with nails that look sub par
i have extremely difficult hair that had been relaxed using the japanese relaxer process for over 7 years
before i had my massage i was dealing with chronic pain and boy did the pain ever melt away
making an appointment for two was a nightmare running in circles with the same conversation
she is very nice and easy to talk to
now i am forced to go to work and have people constantly stare at me
i went in with my daughter to get a fill and pedicure
im really sad that i cant visit happy nails anymore
i went in to phoenix skin and had a list of skin concerns for them to evaluate
good thing i checked on yelp and found seth
it is extremely sad that we all rely on doctors at some point of our lives unfortunately in many instances they are not there to actually help their patients
if youve never had a massage this is a great place to start
all in all i love
now the big day of my visit to get my mole removed i had to wait an hour and a half for them to tell me they called me by mistake
we went to her station and she told me that after i left she got in trouble because she didnt charge me enough
as you continue on into the spa there is a large tea room with cushy lounges offering magazines and servers to help you select tea from the tea bar
she did a wonderful job cutting my hair exactly as i wanted  shes great for conversation too
so i sat down waiting for my nail tech
doesnt seem that out of control does it
dr chan is professional and very well educated in his craft
i asked mine for a deep tissueharder the betterfocus on neck back and legs
i highly recommend this joint if you are looking for a great dance studio with excellent dance instructors
anthony is a perfectionist a true master of his craft with a pride in his work that is simply unmatched
i did notice they do not have as much stock as the other locationthey were out of a few of my fav
we will say that the room was very nice and the bed i wish i could take home it was that comfortable
i came to vegas from a place where i went to a old family babershop for most of my life
i love my lashes they are amazing and thick  i recommend her to anyone that is thinking about getting lashes done
i was really nervous on surgery day
ill never wax anywhere else again
i eventually decided to go with one of the options she presented me with which was to go buy my own hair which would work out cheaper and she would apply it
clean and professional
especially since you cant take the pot to your room
she came back and told me i couldnt get a refund or exchange because all sales were final
jennifer is amazing
danielle is great
1 sunday brunch is one of the best ive experienced
yes im straight and married
the very next day i felt a very painful throbbing on my right ear
reasonably priced and a good selection of colors
customer service sucks
i feel bad because dr halmi is actually really good but hes being lumped in with the rest of the practice which is actually really bad
i love this place
didnt want to argue to make it worse just paid and got out of this poor establishment
she takes the time to make you feel at ease and explains the treatment and what she is doing
my first impression was that this salon reminded me a lot of my grandmas house she is vietnamese
its one of the best deals in vegas for lash extensions
when i saw them advertised for 20 it was a no brainer for me to try
he wasnt able to help me to book my appointment and ask me to call back in december
i like this place because the ladies are really nice
he should have buffed a few more while he was at it
i truly enjoy been there
i paid much more at the canyon ranch spa at the venetian and it was nowhere near as nice or had anywhere near the quality of the staff and service
does that one hair bug you
this is a great place
bit change is good
i felt like this place was just average
my manicure usually lasts well past three weeks without chipping
skeptical as i was we preceded to the shampoo bowl
prices are great compared to for example euphoria
absolutely disgusted with this place and the owner navine maybe it would be prudent to take a few courses in customer service and stop hiding behind pitch black tinted windows and secrets like a rub n tug just sayin
30 for day pass
will definitely keep this place in mind the next time we need any costume or accessories
however i did stop a staff member to ask for an appropriate size and they did accommodate me
quaint salon with a sanitary environment posh decor friendly staff and high quality service
the manicurist was nice and keep trying to sell me stuff but they get commission so i understood so it didnt bother me
i love the ambiance all the ladies especially tracey
my boyfriend was getting a simple quote
it is totally worth the 72
this past weekend i wore a dress which i purchased here last fall
edge fitness is super gym they have my business and loyalty
the first time was a mediocre gel mani which would have had a 4 star
ill be returning regularly
hair cuts are 15 calling ahead for an appointment is recommended they actually said you can text them to check on open times and the hours are very reasonable
you will not regret it
communicate more internally and less trying to make up reasons why you think you are not wrong
you have a facial that truly transforms your skin while having a lovely and relaxing experience
appointments are always on time and feels like you are in and out in a flash
ok so i am totally new to the waxing world
the man on the phone said they didnt give refunds and that if i wanted to come in they would fix the problem there
would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new nail shop
they dont even have those kind of tables or chairs showing in many of them
but i could never find something exact that struck me as being the right one
my toes and feet look wonderful
i couldnt ask for anything better
my boyfriend and i stayed here right around new years
matt garcia is legit
they let me waiting for over 15 hours than told me they could not do a massage on this day and that  i had to reschedule for another time
rebecca is awesome
nothing special or unique but all in all a solid choice
the wood sauna is dangerously splintery in some areas
if you live in the sw valley the access is super easy
i came here to do a shellac manicure with a friend and we made an appointment in advance since they were going to be working on the two of us at the same time
sophia is also a good conversationalist
i finally got my hot water but never did i get the coffee
i went in on friday to get my hair cut layers and bangs and the girl who was cutting my hair seemed to be in a hurry and cut everything uneven one side is longer than the other the layers looks like i let my niece take a pair of scissors and have at it with my hair
i did not have any other salon services so i cant comment further
i really want to grow my curly hair long but the bottom three inches were dry damaged and stringy
i have severe chemical sensitivities and allergies so have a difficult time in most salons
corey is as good as it gets
i will stick to my wonderful asian nail salon where they give great pedicure massages and hot towels
after all this my hair ended up a lot shorter than i wanted it to be so i decided to let it grow out a while before trying to get it fixed
i came from san diego ca and wanted to find someone who knew what they were doing and elli made me a permanent customer
but i dont know why but the nurse called me at the end after all the people who came after me
dana sue she rents a space from him but i think its great to have someone right there that u can see
well i couldnt be more pleased
taylor cut my hair and i definitely recommend her
guys or gals that havent a hairstylist u should try this place and see
i have this thing with yelp that when i see a place that has 3 stars i try it because i end up having an amazing experience
the place is not very big
you dont need to speak good english to be pleasant
as someone who was terrified to get waxed after a horrific experience a few years back i can honestly say now i actually look forward to my appointment every 4 weeks or so
she made 3 of my nails bleed
the rooms dont have a minibar only a fridge
the instructor is a local yogi that has been doing yoga for many years and also has classes downtown
i said i have had no idea that its been a really long time and that it wasnt a big deal
he commented on my tattoo saying that i must be a rebel
what ever happened to the customer is always right
thank u vdara for the upgrade
well so and so came in and that when the shell game started
i just wanted to stay away from this low budget place
i got there one lady was told to do my hair but she was already working on someone so she told another lady to get me started
taraleigh has been cutting my hair for two years now and let me tell you i am no easy client
their passion for making you smile laugh and have beautiful nails is worth the experience
after ruining our day you covered the gratuity for your own employees
jing did a great job
i can tell you that once your in you will feel relaxed at home safe  cared for
they always have activities for kids  food is good and you are close to a lot of shopping
the girl was very friendly but i had asked her to unclog some of my pores around my nose and she completely ignored me
if you are looking for something new give satya a try
i am soooo relaxed after going to see heralso she does awsome spray tans
ive been coming here for over 3 years
i will def be back
the best thing about this place  prices dont change according to your hair length
boo hoo it was 35 thats nothing
in such a lush market of beautiful spas in the valley this one rates average
vicki does nails there and is awesome as well
it has less of a view and the view is over the parking lot
looking over this list i clearly shop here way too much but i have no intention of stopping
shop is very clean and this is definitely our goto nail salon
i had the privilege of having lesley taylor do her magic on my mousy looking hair
we arrived and both went with our massage therapists
every 10 minutes they told me it would be only 5 more minutes
i really cant stress how much this means to me
we will be back for sure for our next trip
im citing management as some of the worst ive seen
she also took the time to fully style it at the end which i really appreciate because it makes a difference in how you feel initially with the overall cut
and it keeps going downhill fast  holes in the toes of the climbing shoes  a trainer to belay who knows nothing about climbing
she showed up on the day of with her tools and equipment
when i lived in toronto i only went to cooney for hair cuts
i have been to basically ever other waxing nail salon in the area to find the best place to get my brows waxed and waxing the city is that place
lawyers dont stroll into court an hour into a trial
their shaving cream is outstanding and they have other products that while they cant do the work of a plastic surgeon they have slightly bent back the hands of father time and how i look when i look in the mirror
just like the office they reside in and the ladies they employ to run the front desk its all a faade
the viet resturant is a 2 blocks away on the 2nd fl
my therapist was amazing her name was carly
ive gotten a million compliments on my hair today alone
the owner was very nice and asked for my name and if i was from the area or familiar
instead i got a super bad service
which was never what i asked
cons check out is 10am which is too early
quiet waiting room  here like they do in tolleson because the 2 times ive been to this one ive arrived on the dot
my husband bought the groupon for me to have a one hour facial and one hour massageit was amazing
very upbeat and friendly
i am beyond shocked that anyone would place a review less than 5 stars and the only possibility is that theyre looking for great manicures and pedicures for free
i am actually considering purchasing the moisturizer she uses
he has autism so it is not all ways the easiest thing to get him to hold still but the staff always has been patient with him and he always leaves looking super cute
there are two pools
very refreshing to get a hairstylist who can cut flattering short styles for women
im looking forward to my next visit
shes also very friendly and make you feel comfortable
unfortunately it really depends on which technician you get
my mom would always take me here to get my nails done and we loved the service we have received
everything always looks great and the salon is very clean
dont let the fact that this hotel isnt one of the swankier newer ones in the middle of the strip fool you
the lady doing my nails last time left to answer the phone before starting my manicure then spent 8 minutes away trying to figure out what was wrong with the balance in the cash registerso i eventually left before she even started
but this guy was careless with the dry manicure and cut my cuticles really deep
i havent had a cut this fresh in ages
i just had my hair highlighted the day before so now im wishing for conditionerbut alas there is none
i  go every month and it keeps my aches and pains away
definitely makes the workout really fun
ive discovered my new favorite nail salon
i got a deluxe pedicure and a gel manicure which were both awesome
i havent been to this ulta in a long time
this salon is so clean and their chairs etc
after some phone tag trying to set up an appointment he was able to work me in later that week
i plan on coming back again
im past not impressed
the manager recommend hair product to help my hair
awful customer service god awful experience and what seems like a bunch of employees not doing their job and trying to get more money out of people
if youre used to something at home ensure you ask for exactly what you want and need for your wax and they will get it taken care of
let me tell youhe put my home grooming efforts to shame
what started as a consult turned into basically the entire staff working their butts off to get my head full of shoddy tapeins removed
i would recommend this place to anyone and everyone
i gotta give a shout out to my fave brandy
you have to be comfortable in wearing nothing or almost nothing but you get a custom tan according to your color and skin history
love love love it
my massage was at noon and there were about 1718 women in the waiting area so i could not even sit down to relax and wait before my therapist came to get me
i went to this ulta to try and find makeup for sensitive skin
holly and tony are the best
i will admit that the way they do nails is cleanlier and the chairs are very cool and plush but its missing something
ive been going here for about 9 years
ps never go see lyndsie at the phoenix salon
i was just there last night for more coloring and hair cut and its perfect
that is too expensive and it was not well done at all
this is my regular nail place
she was so patient and kind
i had the opportunity to get a haircut and beard trim yesterday that was long over due
the only reason i couldnt give this place a 5 star rating was the first time i stayed there an employeeor employees i never got the full story stole my credit card info and luckily my bank noticed obscure charges and cancelled my card immediately and inconveniently as i was just about to make a trip into the us and had no usd only my credit card youd think thatd be reason enough to never want to go back but this hotel is just that awesome i go back anyway
i wouldnt trust anyone from this beauty school to touch my hair
leona i will never cheat on you again
simply the best
ive been to tons of barber shops in town this is one is the best because of brian
the last time i popped in was with a friend who laps this kind of stuff right up and has more money than sense
the front desk girl who had the same blank look on her face the entire time even when she was trying to converse with me tried to tell me it was because the gift card reflected the member rate  i wasnt a member
im pretty sure the first dollar i ever gambled only to put some points on my card for the buffet was at this casino where i walked a way with a couple bucks in winnings
she was nice and did her best to chat with me but im just overall a quiet person who prefers to be the listener so i was probably the one who was frustrating her for not talking a whole lot
recently moved to arizona from la one of the biggest challenges for me was finding a barber
they are clean courteous and professional
i have a lot of hair so i get embarrassed when i go waxing but the lady that helped me made me feel comfortable and kept the conversation going with me
he seemed very concerned the entire rest of the pedicure
marshmallows and marshmallow forks for roasting
i got a pedicure and a fill which is 35
stopped here because my nails were looking ragged
shes fun talented really listens to what you want but also offers her professional advice
went from 5 stars to 1  have never been so insulted in my life when they made me wait 45 minutes and then let someone else go ahead of me and forced me to wait another half hour  which i did not
solar waves is a clean dynamic looking tanning salon thats taking over my heart
very sweet lady who took her time on my pedicure
this time i came in asking for a mani and pedi an hour and a half before close
i just had an amazing experience at the strongsville location
you couldnt pay me to return to this place
they put color instead of bleach my hair turned brassy and looked terrible i then got my hair highlighted by katie c as always at dolce when i got back to fix it but this time went very blonde
my boyfriend took me here to get my nails and toes done
accepted credit cards which was convenient just a dollar more
i then began going to the manager of the salon
the next day i received an email confirmation for an aromatherapy massage
i said the highlights are subtly and he laughed but didnt say anything
the atmosphere was awesome music bumping chatty guys and great cuts
saturday january 10th 2015 comes around and after meeting up with friends for breakfast and a hard day of training at the gym i was ready for some pampering
my so called pedicure was really just washing my feet and painting my toes
with our bellies full it was time to get our pretty on
gel nails that last forever
anyway i noticed the next day after i washed and styled my hair that my hair my layers were uneven
this tattoo shop is exceptional
the artwork on the walls of goddesses and buddha gave me the feeling of being transported somewhere sacredthe artwork people choose to place in their place of business can say a lot
i was scared from the beginning when she seemed as if she has never done a highlight in her life and i left with orange tinted roots
i searched the cnd website looking for a place close by that offered shellac products the newest nochip nail polish and im so glad marie was the closest shes so sweet
do not goeven if youre drunk and desperatestay away
and my facial with arti was yum
it was as if the eyelash gods parted the clouds and there she stood
he also has colored my hair before and done exactly what i wanted
ive had a few massages here so relaxing
cindy does my eyebrow wax perfect
5 a finger
then i found out i had insulted him
a more natural look especially if adding nail tips
almond coconut smoothie body wash cream that aquamarina face putty rolly polly masque wash stuffand that pink soap with the rose petals in itwow rub that across your heels for soft kissable feet
been coming here since 2008staff is awesome
it is necessary for me to get regular massages to keep my headshoulders from taking over my entire skull
i dont have a certain artist that i go to
flat screens were posted all over the place with espn blasting away
she is truly amazing
my prescription before was 800 in both eyes with a slight astigmatism in my left eye aka i was pretty much blind without my glasses
we had a king bed and a pull out cotcouch  there is a centre divider there so you are not having to look at the person sleeping on the other side of the room thankfully
it is fabulous
i got ray shes a professional and have strong hands place is clean people are nice and i highly recommended
im a big fan of this and their sister hotel the pantages
the full effects of the arizona sun was messing with my attitude and it was not good
again the massages are ultimately what we are there for so thats why i gave a 4 star this round
gel manicure and pedicure was 50 and they had excellent service
the food dear lord the food
update from one to two stars the manager was very sweet and apologetic and gave me a full refund in the end
he said designs were his specialty
she took her time and did not seem rushed
super clean very nice convenient and classy
they offer a great deal of 50 off found here on yelp
what a complete waste of hard earned money
it is situated in the middle of scottsdale close to everything but you feel like you have been transported to a place in colonial mexico or tuscany the gardens awe amazing we stayed in a room that backed up to the street and one could hear traffic in the mornings but this did not bother me in the least
i will never come here again
prices arent bad and there is a huge variety of gel colors to pick from
overall this is a great place to detox and get away from it all for a while
i consider myself a pain in the behind kind of customer but they always do me right
i dont care either way
best yet shes friendly and listens and she is affordable
on top of that after the gel was put on and dried there were bumps the excess from the white tip that were filed off werent buffed off correctly each finger were filed and shaped differently just all types of wrongs
the staff was amazingly friendly
if you need your locks tended shes definitely your girl
i actually fell asleep once
unfortunately i was not seen during my lunch break i understand that sometimes things happen and it delays other patients
only drawback during my stay was that the indoor showers and sauna we being renovated
however one of the distinct pleasures i reserve exclusively for las vegas is a classic shave
they are so polite
attended for a corporate function
now you have identified what you do not like and could address those issues
they often have deals because they cannot keep regular clients
she also does a bomb blow out
you have to request a good nail tech
the prices are pretty reasonable
the fact that those large stones stayed on that long really shocked me
this place is under new ownership for about 6  8 months and its my go to place for pedicures
she even messed up on 1 of my eyebrows it was thicker on top and the other one was thinner on top and thicker on bottom go figure i had to go somewhere else to get them fixed
how hard is it to understand please cut my hair about 2 inches but keep up with the layers i dont want a straight cut id like to keep my layers in which i had to repeat about 4 times
here is the place
but not on a saturday
shes great with every color
will never again get my haircut here again
when i arrived at the salon i was greeted and everyone was really friendly and attentive offering me drinks etc
im 9 months pregnant and havent felt this relaxed until now
been going here for 10 years and no matter where around the west valley i move i will always make sure to go here for my nails and brows
there customer service skills are very poor
the procedure was quick and painless
i stopped in the piercing shop down the street from my house and walked out almost immediately
the guy at the front desk was rude and talking to other people while i was standing in front of him
or they better hope
der besuch in den schwabenquellen war wunderbar
its the bomb
im not even kidding when i say she drilled the shit out of my nails
i thought no way is this little thing going to be able to give me a good massage
she brings over a stool that my feet go on when i take them out of the nice hot water and also a stool for her to sit on
ok im feeling im scoring this high too
this was my third time here 1st timepedicure only with jenny she was good
making reservations was super simple they were on time everything was amazing it is my new goto place in las vegas
the design is modern and the casino floor is very spacious
they do a good job its clean and they have tons of gel and regular polish options
the extra programs and classes they offer are great as well
still come here regularly every 2 weeks my nail tech is lisette she takes walk ins but better to call and make appointment so that you get her
this place rocks
great experience at sephora recently
this my first experience with ruffians for a hot towel shave and i was really looking forward to it
great customer service by tina and tim reasonable prices and beautiful nail work
never been so disappointed
my entire treatment from beginning to end was wonderful
you only get a few channels and no dvr
because she didnt charge me for starting a manicure she told me to stop asking for a discount
im natural and my hair is 4a3c
the girl was in such a rush to get my pedicure done so she could start my full set that i have nail polish all over my cuticles on my toes
she explained what would happen and left the room for me to undress
lodging  4 stars i really enjoyed the historical background of the property and the rooms where each in their own onestory area i was honestly expecting some high rise thing and a small patio
also you can make your own lotion scents
massage envy is supposed to relax you not stress you out
she was really good and efficient
it is so clear that this girl loves what she does and it shows
you can walk to sam selzers steak house and perhaps bahama breeze
walking in i was impressed with the large open space  how clean it looked  smelled
here i am at elaines getting a much needed pedimani again
i really love how comfortable it is as well
my very last visit was even worse
best baber shop in las vegas
this place is overpriced and there are way better choices in the area
the staff is friendly and the spa is wellkept and clean
every gal in this place is great
and maybe you should hand out after care booklets i had absolutely no mascara on my eyelashes which i stated to you that i dont like dramatic looks and eye lashes plus mascara would of been exactly that dramatic
again i should had said something when i paid but i just didnt feel like dealing with it
walkins are generally welcome and i can only recall one time that they were really busy and it was on a friday after everyone got off of work
simple as that problem solved
i will never go back to this salon ever again
i always leave happy with beautiful nails for weeks
i had serve swelling bruising and i lost the ability to straighten my arm rotate my wrist and my grip strength was significantly impaired
there are so many bright and colorful products to look at
my suggestion would be to go to the other many choices in the area where they use clean cuticle nippers and dont water down gel polish
i waited only about 5 minutes to be approached by kay
she is very friendly and gives great facial massages
i got my first tattoo here and can i say what stupendous service
cost savings allows you to get more products
the ladies all lady staff yay
beautiful work i will definitely go back for my next one
dont go here
this cost me 100  i was refused the student discount on the price list even after showing my student id as my hair is thick
not sure if i can attach a picture of my nails to this review
i tried calling to schedule but no one ever answers the phone
final hair color wasnt as i wanted it to be i really regreat trying different hair dresser than mine
her facials are incredibly effective and therapeutic in addition to relaxing
almost never staffed
although my time with a stylist at this salon was awful
i still love sephora but i will be coming to bare escentuals for most of my make up needs from now on
it is quite small but fairly cozy
oh and the safe in the room wasnt working
the pool felt amazing
the first couple times killed me but my body was butter for the next week
i told her no style just braid it straight back in a straight line
i signed a credit card receipt for 42 and you changed the amount to 50 dollars without my knowledge and consent this is fraud
the toilet ran continuously unless the handle was jiggled afterward
also and this is the biggest benefit the hotel is connected to the toronto convention center so it was literally a two minute walk from the hotel lobby to the hall where the trade show i was attending was located
in addition to giving me a great haircut brady was personable and attentive and ended up giving me the best haircut ive had in a cool minute
very informative about the products she used and she has amazing talent
cant wait to use the new hotbox detox and teeth whitener
i purchased a groupon for a manicure pedicure months ago and called to schedule my appointment
however they are late pretty much every time
ive been coming here for the last 9 monthsand unfortunately i feel that the quality has declined
a full week goes by with no sketch
its close to home comfortable affordable and consistent
besides those two little things it was an overall great experience
the price was typical for a more trendy modern salon
despite the awkward position of the original tattoo neil worked extremely hard to create a design that worked
this in itself is very hard to find at most nail salons and with having the best nail art in town theyre pretty hard to beat
huge mistake coming here
i cant see this lasting more than a week
they will happily give you a doggy bag if you cant manage it all
ok so i dont write reviews very often unless i feel compelled to do so
i am left astonished by the owners response and reaction to my yelp reviewhe has been an absolute pleasure to deal with and has been more than accommodating
ive been a customer since 122011 and i recommend them to everyone
my sister also loved her manicure
i used to use topcuts now i plan to make them my hairstyling goto
she also stretched me out as an added bonus to help out my lower back issues ive been having
i got a pedicure done by dana
this place is a treasure
i also do not have the time of day to arrange and prebook hair cuts
i showed them to several people who had done them before and they were so impressed
the staff were wonderful and friendly and we felt very at home
madlayn is wonderful
haircut looked great price was great
i highly recommend for anyone
lise nail spa on yonge is a lot more professional in nails
my haircut was very done with up most perfection i really recommend turk the barber hes very professional
overall the place is really clean and neat
just like in thailand i was greeted with the changing of footwear to symbolize leaving the outside world behind and entering a desert oasis designed to just melt away all of the trade show madness i had experienced
lets break it down  location great most people have a car in scottsdale so being close to a shopping area wasnt necessary
i trust them completely
which i will
she is a wonderful asset to kohls and i look forward to seeing her again
i chose water as my feet were being soaked in tea
never ever again
i simply dont have the time to do it
im also upset  the fact that when i got to the salon that catherine girl was still working on someone elses hair so me being late wasnt the factor at all yet she kept saying how late i was for my appointment
i took my husband to nouvelle maria spa and salon today for his birthday
good job on my nails but i had a reservation and still had to wait like 40 minutes
she is fast and accurate
a good day for me
recently in an effort to save money as i expected my first baby i tried other less expensive people and even athome products and ultimately i gave up because nothing compared to taras work
rebecca went out of her way to check with me to make sure it was correct
six people  in line and only one checker
no one came to us for a quite long time until i walked to the bar
clean salon professional setting
everything was clean great customer service and the rooms are very relaxing
such friendly environment
well its close to my house and all and they do have products but it is the worst in customer service i think i just might start going to sephora down the road but i been here plenty of times and the ladies dont bother asking if you need help or anything
seriously this is the best my face has looked in a decade
what we didnt expect was the refrigerator not to work
the girl definately knew what she was doing
i walked in after getting a facial and with recommendations from the spa
stay tuned for more adventures in hip hop but for now props to distrct for supporting the vegas hip hop community with style and grace
amanda is amazingly thorough and knowledgable as she works efficiently on the task at hand whilst informing you of the differences between sugaring and waxing the procedures and the aftercare
he has become a great friend and always makes sure my hair is healthy and looking great
it is also quite a comfortable place  i have never felt sneered at or as if i do not belong because i do not have a prada bag on my arm
it has a small entrace lobby to check in a manicure area and in the back a pedicure area where each has a massage chair
eyebrows lash extensions microblading
i work as a chef so my feet are always pretty sore this foot massage was super super relaxing
i have a very relaxing time every time i go susy is just awesome
no apology was made for her mistake no discount was offered nothing
you wont be disappointed
ask for nick and hell get you in
i just felt like an intruder passing through the salon to reach the retail
despite the scheduling difficulties i would 100 recommend jeanette
such a disappointment and waste
and she let me know about their discounts for first time customers which made the whole elaborate shabang only 85 dollars
on the recommendation of my auntinlaw we came shopping here for supplies while we were in town
love it there
they are friendly and do such a great job at gently adjusting your body to improve  your form or reach a deeper stretch
salon is clean and nail techs are very pleasant
i cannot thank her enough
i can recommend him without reservation
super clean salon with fancy massage chairs for my pedicure
this review is based on my many separate occasions at the m even when we dont get the chance to stay in the amazingly beautiful rooms that are state of the art we usually try to hit this place on our way outta town back to la for two reasonsfirst the buffet is legit and second its your last classy stop to gamble before state line
sure why not  very average salon and nothing fancy
it was a great experience
once i got in my float pod i thought okay this is insane you literally have no choice but to float
the hotel fees come with awesome complimentary items such as soda ice candy bars and other snacks
honestly karla is amazing
love this place
many menu choices
i found the perfect stylist in ebonee degourville she is really into healthyhair and very good customer satisfaction i been with her for several years and will follow her every where she goesshe is fast and efficient and does a great job
i was hesitant about getting laser hair removal you hear horror stories however i have found christine to be wonderfully professional
i saw iris she was very nice sweet and professional
price is very fair for the area
so i walked out of lifetime fitness and signed up for anytime fitness 14 day free trial
the amount of money we pay for school we should have some supplies
and the lady who shaped my brow took the time to look at my brows carefully before shaping and she was also warm and friendly and i thought did a very good job with my brows
rx pickup service w easy pay a credit card already on file in the drivethru pharmacy lane was efficient on my recent visit
i had gotten my eyebrows waxed here before and was not 100 happy as i had to go home and pluck them myself to clean them up
i will never c any1 else but her
while i was embarrassed and felt apologetic at first i realized after he left the room that this probably made the most sense
i was planning on growing my hair out but i love my new cut so much i think i might just keep it short
thats fine if you tell me it wont take before hand
a doctor can be a good surgeon but not a good doctor
despite the intricacy of the irish patterns and knots he spaced everything far enough apart that when the ink spreads as it does that the skin would not appear gray where it should not
purchased a 1 hour massage through groupon
yahoo travel doesnt have a way for me to review them on yelp but you guys get negative stars for customer service
i will never go back
if you ever have a problem with your nails they give you a free fix  which most salons ive been to dont do
i wouldnt mind so much if this didnt prevent them from losing focus and restarting on the exact same spot they left off
just so understocked i could not believe it
back to supercuts i guess
finger weg  da sieht man im nachgang aus wie wenn mans selber gemacht htte  orangegelb  wie ein frischgeschlftes kken
to get me in first
while doing a google search i discovered the art of acupuncture
and the last time i came my polish started bubbling before i left
she took her time and did a great job and i am picky
so content  impressed with the customer service at jt nails
we enjoyed the large standard hilton pool area
i was in and out so fast
needless to say the shaking and the smoky smell were less than pleasant
everyone there is passionate about what they do and their connection they make with their clients
valet parkingprivate entrances
today i come back to get a peel its not so bad i love this i actually got their package deal which im really enjoying cant wait for the rest of my peel package and see the final product of my face
i started the supplements she recommended and im slowly but surely improving
update dec 2016 steam room is hot
well i have been to the chandler and this place
if you are going for a one time massage i would absolutely recommend her
thats fine im sure he gets a lot of customers and it would be hard to remember them all fine
there are tons of trainers around which i personally want nothing to do with but theyre all nice and dont bother us in any way
the girl who answered the phone was friendly so it gave me hope that this time would be a better experience
sign up for the kimpton membership its free and not only will you get free wifi but youll feel really special too
worth every penny
went to bbw for a quick work mission buy gifts for a meeting
awesome experience and i have a smile in the inside as well as on the outside so i give it a two thumbs up
let me preface ive owned 72 salons throughout the country and then sold to a major franchise so i know the salon business like back of my hand
the online scheduling option was something i really liked as well
did a terrible job
other than that this place gets 4 stars for being clean professional and in a mall
the lady who did my sister in laws nails cut to of her fingers and and she was bleeding
she is very professional and cares about keeping your hair healthy
valet parking was really fast and always courteous
this is horrible ladies please avoid
i was so pleased with the service and price that i made another appointment to come back
robert has always known how to decipher what i want and put his own professional spin on the idea to make my hair beautiful
i am always very smiley and nice to people but these girls did not give the same respect back
want that extra shot of expresso
i see others have left negative reviews in which i personally saw no merit
very knowledgeable and attentive staff
he did not hassle me with any questions
she drew blood during the manicure and after i noticed she just wiped off her tool and put it back in her drawer
takes less than 5 mins brazillian wax first time 45 then you get 10 off if you come in less than a month  takes 10 mins deepa is very nice she tries to talk to you to make you forget about the pain
dont go to a ghetto shop go here
after my daughter voiced her concerns all conversations ceased in english and another language was used
the only thing i will say is that the receptionist seems nice and i feel bad that she always has to deliver the bad news since she doesnt seem to be in charge of scheduling everything
my french looked like hell
when i approached the manager about the issue he didnt want to take responsibility and told me i had to deal with the contractor barber directlywhom of course didnt want to refund me for the bad hair cuts
the supervisor was running from one atmcash redemption machine to another to fix the situations
the staff are knowledgeable pleasant and very helpful
i have cmt type 1a which is a degenerative muscle disease
hannah wilson is the best
the walls are painted with serene colors like yellow pastel green and a warm red faux pillars cover up their ventilation tubes
im an entertainer so im super picky about my nails well he will be my nail tech here on out
he is very professional and has talent in spades
i tried giving them several chances but always got the same response from them
she did exactly what i asked and made the experience more than a tad memorablei just wsh that my hair grew fasterthat hot towel and head massage was worth the price alonemmmmmmm
okay style but the color came out differently every time i went
obviously a lot of that is due to the customers as obviously employees arent going around doing that sort of thing but theyre not cleaning up after it either
this salon is much smaller than most and its much quieter which i prefer
they do both full body or foot massages
that was disappointing
i am furious and will now have my attorney begin proceedings
not the end of the world but annoying now that its a month later and growing in and my roots are hideous usually i can get away with 12 weeks in between colorings
this place is less expensive than the spas on the strip regarding entrance fee 20 or services
coz it is their jobdamn grouponthough i do my hair here without couponshe did a good cut and nice mild colori love iti want to give it a 5 star but i dont coz i wish it could be more cleaner in here
however even if you make an appointment be prepared to wait and i used to wait a long time 3045 minutes at times
i finally found a new stylist in cheryl
wouldnt go back if they paid me
the prices are reasonable the staff is talented and friendly and the environment is great
at first i was afraid to find a new stylist so i was flying back home for 100 haircuts which became super unreasonable really quickly
the concierge is great and always made sure the restraunts took special care of us so you might want to talk to her
upon walking into the main room all of s sudden multiple therapists showed up
thank you casi you did a wonderful job on my hair love the cut see you soon for colorits a very relaxing place  felt very at ease there casi is fantastic
he could tell that i wasnt looking for much conversation but made sure to introduce himself and make sure i was comfortable and happy with the work he did
this was my first visit to this salon
its a good get away
ps lee did my nails and she was awesome
ditto the review below
i will never go back to versa tan and cherie is my girl when i feel the need to bronze up
i mentioned it to my therapist and she appologized and was sincere
when we first saw the room i was overjoyed and planning my 5 star woo hoo as good as it gets
i would definitely go back to her just for her care and patience and she did a great job
i used to go all the time when i lived down the street but charging almost 30 for a gel manicure when the polish doesnt cover the entire nail
she asked before she started if i preferred deep or gentle pressure
they felt great on my skin
they move you from that room to your service room
ive been going here the past 5 years
the decor is oldtimey and awesome
give it the test
meh is how i feel when i come to the south pointe
come to find out i did have to pay
also its been a little over a week and i am migraine free let alone any type of headache
i came here with my boyfriend to add to my piercing collection and i can definitely say i found my new piercer
the beer just rounded it all up
what a nice and classy place to go and get a mans haircut and relax
it is the most luxurious thing ever
she was super sweet and did a great job on my manipedii especially love how she trimmed filed my nails where they dont catch on things and how to do my pedicure  since im pregnant  not sure that i believe the whole touching the wrong spot can induce early labor but better safe then sorrymy cousin seemed to have a good experience with her pedicure as well
also dont go with freshly washeddone up hair as youre going to get a scalp massage with some oils
i was unsure of what i wanted done but nancy gave me the best manipedi of my life
the atmosphere was great
there are 2 televisions one for the living room and one right above the fireplace for the bedroom
it probably also irritated the tattoo
avalon is doing a disservice to their students and definitely to their clients
she seemed confident and that she should have it in within a few days or up to a week
i visited on a thursday evening last customer before they closed and they took their time with me
call for an appointment and the new location they have completed their move to 4215 n 16th street
after having had several not so good hair cuts at different salons and finally finding a salon that gave me a great cut but at an extremely high price i decided to give parlour salon a try after all my daughters hair is always on fleek i booked an appointment with stephanie on line convenient
we both ended up getting a pedicure and manicure and i can say confidently we will both be back for sure
i was looking for new eye creams and the lady was able to explain the benefits for each type of line
glo carries a series of three skin care products as well including an exfoliator and tinted moisturizer which helps to extend the life of the tan
the young woman who cut my hair was courteous professional and she did a great job
best massage ive had in a long time
they both are the best in their fields
tommy is the best i always leave happy and with impeccable nails
they are super sweet to my youngest who is now 3 yrs old
linda is very nice
master stylist dennis okeefe was amazing
theyre very well stocked  this was one of the best customer experiences ive had and i would definitely return
soaking in the hot tub steam room  sauna for only 27 a day woohoo
the barber was patient kind and very detailed
michelle is really great
the other thing is that i find loreal to be quite damaging
he did but they are super uneven and bumpy on the top
excellent experience and clean location
went to get my eyebrows waxed
nice quiet store with beautiful indian music and nice staff
this was very different for me but something i would recommend for everyone
you are asking me this is the 3rd bad experience not fist  they do not care about your experience and seems like they dont even know what to do when u have one i will never go there again and i wouldnt recommend it for anyone i dont ever write reviews but this experience just made me want to help others
i did and i couldnt be happier with the new salon i found
my stylist actually took the time to ask me what i wanted in detail was suuuuper sweet and time sensitive for a dinner i was getting my hair done for
one of whom appeared to be a supervisor
the results are amazing
relaxing  very nice service
her products smell and feel amazing
the hostess was especially friendly and helpful
it was worth 20  there are a million places try another
i recommend her and any of her employees
2nd time  i asked for synthetic pillows when i reserved the room and then called the day of
tiffany and i also had a nice conversation while she was working on my nails
i will definitely be back
it has to be the best haircut i have ever gotten
i bough clip prongs for 399 at bsw
that was the biggest bs i have ever heard why are you working at a salon
i am really happy with what i got
fortunately i was being dropped off because parking is a challenge  there arent a lot of spots and several are awkwardly positioned perpendicular and close to the main road
so if you want to treat yourself to an enjoyable salon experience book an appt at rochelles
check out the pictures
just a heads up
hes not much of a talker which was nice because i really just wanted to relax
she was also so very kind and gentle with my grandmother and let me sit next to her
then when i got home i discovered she had left a strip of wax on me
ann is so knowledgable about her product and not only applies the tan beautifully but will talk you through what would work best for your skin type
we stop here every time we visit vegassometimes twice
two nights and two spa packages made for an incredible two day break
finally someone started on one of us around 1140 to make up for the lateness they offered a free design
when my sister was trying on the wigs she  told the sales person she was hurting her and started to cry the sales woman just keep pushing saying she works  on commission
just moved back to vegas from nyc and gotta say oscars is hands down the best barber shop from the east coast to the west coast
ulta locations in socal have a reputation for being filled with super snooty sales girls who could care less about helping you
stephanie did a great job of explaining the process
she had even arranged for me to try three of the spa services that same day if time allowed
unpacking my suitcase and even just reaching into my purse the following days was horrifying
my eyelashes look amazing  i love love them
they need to develop a system to account who comes in first
i love having lots of good hair days in succession
wonderful customer service very cozy and nice spa with very reasonable prices
listen to your customer dont go and cut my hair the way you like it cut it the way i like it
basic pedicure is 18 and includes hot stones
very professional very clean exactly what i was looking for
kenna did a superb job
the whole time i was laying down brandon was calming and reassuring  he was even throwing out more random knowledge about my piercings
the relaxation room is wonderful too
her work is exquisite
let me get the obvious part out of the way  saskia and her entire team are among best in the business
i have no doubt my hair will look fantastic when i start getting it cut by her regularly and once its grown back out several inches
if you want your eyebrows to look amazing you need to come here
now i am sworn off nail sense forever
melodie not only understands how my hair will or wont  cooperate with any particular cut but she was able to repair my color
i cant remember the guy who pierced my tragus but he was horrible
i called and they let me know that i can just walk in
i hate it when they do that
i havent been turned away from a walkin before but its probably cause it doesnt take much time to cut my hair and it wasnt particularly busy during those times
com so i had quite a many services here in one day
but i kept watching karens work on kingz tattoo parlor instagram i have never met her before
there were 2 other rooms too
showers  very nice
the rooms are beautiful
so it stayed with us
i went to a diffrent place before and nothing even happened i found out they do facial and booked it for next week what a hidden gem
they offered my bf a cold drink which was nice after walking from our hotel
so friendly inviting dr burke is such a down to earth doctor not your typical average boring doc
had a party for 8 people  everyones hair came out beautiful
i confronted him about it and he said that he thought it looked better the way he drew it
i think your experience at rainbow nails really depends on who you get
to be clear both procedures hurt
best haircut i have ever had and was shocked at how cheap it was
i want to start off by saying that nellys facial was probably the best one ive had so far
i hope she would be the one who would do my eyebrows again when i come back to that place
not only are parts of my hands bright orange i have an area kelsey completely missed on my back
i was extremely happy with my cut and got several compliments even though it wasnt a drastic change
sarah is absolutely amazing
shes great at what she does very gentle and very quick
she made my experience an awesome one
i thought as a guy it would feel weird going to a salon instead of a barber for a haircut but everyone is really cool so i feel comfortable
complimentary mimosas as well
he was a foot angel from china
i was greeted right of way  waited 15 min  no big deal i didnt make a appointment  the lady who cut my hair was very nice
skin has several layers and then theres blood underneath
the owner and staff were all wonderful
left without buying
but now im having a sever allergic reaction to the medication prescribedhives
botox experience was awesome
i dont like to argue with service industry workers and i had already had a disappointing day so i simply left
she got a manicure and i got a pedicure and we were really happy with the way they turned out
you could also hear people walking inside the huge room as new clients come in
i recently came here with my bridal party and they were able to accommodate our large request
update trinity is now at 59th ave  peoria nails by andy
little on the pricy side but you pay for what you get
overall i really like having this store so close to home
and i love that its non smoking
this place is amazing
laura is great
i usually get both gel nails and a pedi and im always pleased with my nails when i leave
my pedicure was rushed
other than the product aimee was awesome to talk to and i really appreciated how much care she showed
there is one tech who is chattier than i prefer but thats ok i still give them five stars for service
always my salon of choice
we were offered green tea and bottled water which was nice
an amazing variety of products for such a small location
rene and his team  sal and treves did a superb job of moving our stuff and showed me that my former standards for movers show upmove stuffdont break anything or steal anything were waaaaay too low
her own employees apologize for her when she walks away
i have been getting pedicures my whole life and never have i bled
peaceful relaxing  private through out
i would highly recommend four seasons dental spa
took my daughter here to get a makeover for her sweet sixteen
the only thing that saved this lady from my wrath is my mom being there with me  to purposely damage someones nails because they express their dislike is absolutely ridiculous
while changing my clothes i heard a mans voice
i have been to this day spa a few times in the past and loved the service that was provided
chantal went above and beyond to squeeze me in to touch upcorrect lash extensions i wasnt fully happy with which i so appreciated
check them out
however tippy toes nail salons website was clear straightforward and contained detailed information about services and prices
i always go to her when i want nice designs instead of just simple one color nails
the atmosphere was cozy and elegant
im very particular about my eyebrows and she was spot on not a single hair was left behind
also my friend absolutely loved her masseuse tammy
when his wife does my pedicure with nail art the same thing happens and people are always noticing how classy her designs are
i will continue to come back and recommend this place to everyone
i will go back
you had some privacy when you were in your stylists section
which was awesome considering i didnt make an appointment and it was a saturday
i get my hair done by irene and i love this place
clean and friendly
the lounge is very pleasant and upbeat
shes the only braider for my hair
i made it clear over and over and over how hard ive been working to get my length but both senior stylists that worked with my hair didnt listen at all
my mom brought me here today and i knew i was in for a terrible time when i saw it was inside walmart
the worst 50 haircut i ever hadwith a kind of cheesy arrogance about the place
not only that but they had 1 person at the front with a second going in and out
they had me under the hair dryer for 2 hours
so just come to the pretty kitty
jim and vivian  wife were super friendly
a great time was had by all
morgan did an incredible job with my color retouch and eyebrow wax and tint
this is a place that isnt extremely close to my house but i will drive back to go there again because i had a great experience
manager could use customer service training on how to deal with a dispute she told me i was wrong when plain as day you can see by the photos i sent her
he does great work
for sure a regular client now
i guess the front desk girls didnt really like me too bad im more beautiful than them and im a paying bitch guest
so far so good
it is a hop and a skip from my brothers north las vegas home
any of them work well
now that my girl has left ill try another at a salon closer to me and hope for the best
i guess that will teach me to comment or complain about a haircut that mitzi does
im giving 5 stars for the customer service i received after my complaint to management
the massage was excellent and the therapist really focused on my shoulders like i asked her to
what makes a good salon
i was in town for a wedding and my daughter made me an appointment with emily cook always risky when youve had one person style your hair for years
he even made comments about how i should have been taking better care of it
having been disappointed at another polished location this changed my mind
i have been to this salon a few times in the past and have never been disappointed by the stylists but gloria is amazing
my sister said the young man she had was very strong but no one had good technique
theyll do in a pinch as theyre very fast  and the price really cant be beat but thats about it
but not enough to take a star away
the lady that i got made my visit so uncomfortable by the time i was done with trying to up sell me it was almost comical she asked me 4 times if i wanted a pretty flower after i said no the first time she should have respected what i asked for
the owner eva genuinely knows her stuff and she educates me on skin care needs every time i see her
now  i dont have a credit card
the location is super easy to get to and the parking is free
she was able to take the knot out on my shoulder that ive had for a while
i went to the lobby to tell the front desk
confused as to why she was working on me and not who i made an appointment with i asked
i look forward to going there in the next month
the guy in the front was very welcoming
i have been going to bare necessity for over a year
the price was super affordable in comparison to other shops nearby
there was no massage on my hands or feet
when done the all important shaving of the neck with a straight edge razor proved they are for real
if i ever come back to vegas and need some pampering ill be sure to come back
we were treated very well
thank you for getting me nice and fresh for my wedding
however if you dont like to talk to people when you are relaxing that might be beneficial to you
the room was done in an asian boudoir theme
diamond is such a fancy name so they must live up to it
the casino floor is pretty though and im not one to turn down a free drink so when my stepdad  brother hit the tables i park myself at a bar feed one of the video machines the occasional dollar and drink makers to my hearts content
they definitely didnt look as full as i thought they would considering i opted for the most lashes
lots of water  exercise which is recommend after a treatment
the best to get you ready for summer or any event
kim helped us get all of our belongings out of our room the morning we checked out and was a major dog fan
they are very clean and professional
oh id also mention that i have never had the hot towel wipe down  after the cut  nice
not happy about this
they use dermalogica products which is great because it doesnt break my face out and barb is just amazing i always leave there with my skin glowing
i work in retail and hence get odd days off and every minute of that day off is precious
the massage chairs are heavenly
vicki is uhmazing
if you think making an appointment will prevent you from waiting  think again
dont forget they also do waxing here
so when i went here it was my very first time ever being in an ulta store
i asked specifically for someone comfortable with short hair but do not believe that is the case based on results
salmon cooked just right and flavorful kobe beef tender and juicy
keep in mind it doesnt take long to be certified to do eyelash extensions but what does take long is having experience in doing them and dealing with customers appropriately
this salon lives up to its name
i did need a touch up so she fit me in quickly and not only did she do an amazing touch up but gave me a medium eyeliner this time and it looks amazing
i would definitely recommend this place and i hope to return for another treatment in the near future
of course i did my research to find the best in the city
i have been to tons of places and i am extremely picky but i will never go to anyone else ever again
thats their only anesthetic for an extra 25 by the way  they offered ice as a numbing agent  while offering to burn me pick at the wart and burn it some more
i think if the office and the doctor got with the times they could deliver better service to their patients
i have been here several times because of friends and i was never truly impressed to begin with
it always looks so much healthier when i leave
the nail tech left gel polish all around my cuticles
he was patient and understanding and overall were extremely happy
we will definitely be back
amazing place for getting a tattoo
i could almost hear everything they said
lol she was amazing with my baby and his hair looked great
i didnt catch the gentlemans name this go around but ill def be going back for more of what hes servin up
heres how their website describes the traditional shave this relaxing escape begins with a hot towel
this location is amazing as always
had to call because flight came early to check in earlier and we had no problems
sometimes haircuts are experiences good or bad
i was a new patient who was referred by my primary doctor
and we never got a call of apology or inquiry
so in a frustrating sequence we had different rooms due to a weird policy
my cuticles were all cut up when i left
she is by far one of the best cosmetologist ive ever met
reversa is one of those massage therapists that you will be comparing to other therapists forever
it is always hard to find  someone who knows how to cut guys hair fade and blend it well
the section for trial sizes near the cashier counter to the back right of the store is extensive and having gone to two sephora stores this week noticed that there were different items here yay
the vibe in the salt cave is so cool
although i was hesitant to get my brows threaded i wanted to try it
good for couples or friends
my son got his first hair cut here
its the best one hes had since we moved to vegas and it only cost him 10
after then someone transgender did come in so i think there must have been some sort of name confusion
and then he went on to tell me about his friend who was definitely not irish
sheena is a wonderful and talented woman who knows how to make you feel glamorous
they have well over enough equipment to match the clientele facilitating the gym which is nice so that i dont have to ask anyone how many sets they have left
i am giving it 1 star because i went on my day off to enjoy myself and get a pedicure there was hardly anyone there when i got there and about 2 mins of my feet being in the water more people came in
it seemed from all the people coming in and out he had been working straight through the day for quite some time
it has so much potential but it falls short in so many ways
my hair turned out great and i am appreciative that they reached out to me in attempt to make things better with my overall experience with them
once in awhile ill find a product that is missing the ingredient info so i just skip over to the next product that catches my eye or perhaps more appropriately my olfactory nerves
let me tell you when kids go out of town for pleasure or for sports events one of the things they look forward to is enjoying the pool
shima was very patient with us
clean great hours and reasonable packages
quality clothing my ass
we live in idaho but i will go back to get my nails done every year when we go to vegas
i cant remember what exactly i got but i remember two things my egg was fully cooked but it was supposed to be over medium and the asparagus was burnt like literally black
immediately i felt like i was hanging out with my boys
they are amazing
he pulls my hands around and twisted them and hurts
i promise you that you will be happy with your results
if you like your waiting room to have raging music and a  bathroom with no handtowels and a toilet with topographical scum come right up
i told the girl that i had to go to a wedding so she would be careful
i wont bore you with details of why its a one star  other than  our car was broken into and the security staff blamed us  for parking there
this is a fun place to go and i always feel comfortable here
glenn is such a sweet and kind guy plus he does brows
pros  1 rooms are pretty spacious i was able to accommodate my whole party  2 having the ability to get extra room keys with no problem 3 nonsmoking which was heaven for me since i have asthma  4 housekeeping provided us with as many towelslinensblankets as we needed  5
came in for the first time today and im so glad i did
thats the best price ive seen in pittsburgh for a manipedi so far
the over all vibe of the store is welcoming  to me that is very important
the  salon was very neatclean  organized
i was in and out in about 10 minutes and the price range is very reasonable
fell in love with her  once i met her
she cared and did what i wanted with my hair not what she thought
this mom is happy
we were the first two in line to wait for gel manicures i was surprised to beat the rush on this day
the administrative staff is rude cold and unwilling to help fix this situation
i have and will continue to send referrals to your place
im not going to be charged more just because they put a liner in a pedicure bowl no thanks
so then i had this chemical rubbed all over my face which turned me into a blotchy red mess and kinda burned my skin
ask for special liquid gel in the silver containers
i am the youngest of the four and the two middle brothers did not agree to getting a tattoo so it was down to just my eldest brother nahko and myself but throughout the years we never had a chance to meet up and get it done or even figure out what exactly we wanted
ask for jacqueline
i have no doubts why
its run by a bunch of nice ladies who were very welcoming
that wasnt the worst part  she then got the grater tool and took a huge chunk out of my heel
staff was friendly and the service was fantastic
we discuss our plans for after our hair transformations
thanks vanity blowout bar
will return for sure
this was worse
i challenge anyone to find a more relaxing situation involving a razor at your neck
beurteilung gilt auch fr estravaganza  die beurteilungen fr die sexgttin und ihre liebesdienerinnen sind mehr  zu toppenmehr als 5 sterne
the thunder bomb was a great energy drink with plenty of pick me up but i wasnt feeling jittery afterwards
arent we the customer who is paying them for a service
on my way to frys i noticed that cvs directly across the street had not one car in their spacious drive through
i was able to trust her 100 with my which isnt an easy thing for me to do
i was a little annoyed when i first entered because i showed up early and they were running behind
we will definitely go back
i drive far just to come here and i will as long as they are here
well according to my doctor the second degree burn i sustained at the spa couple of weeks ago is starting to heal
lue and stephen are both very entertaining gentlemen with wonderful style
if it gets a bit dull just wipe it down with alcohol and it sparkles again
van is the co owner with his wife
i love the service
well worth the drive from berea but wish it was closer
ask for lazer if you want a shave  this dude has his technique down
recently moved here and found joncen
i visited this establishment on a thursday after lunch
great april special going on now
for 40 without tip i was given a 15 hour pedicure
my mother said shed rather shop at sacs where they bend over backwards and are so sweet
she did an amazing job
it has been 3 years since i swore off this salon but i decided to go in today in hopes that it was under new management  i am so glad i did
i really did
she told me prp would work even better for me i was scared to try it but she convinced me that i would benefit much more from it
when i came back to pick her up she kept going on about how much she liked the friendly staff and beautiful interior
it feels like im at a trendy bar on the strip
anyways after the cut i got a hairwash by some dude
colin took time to discuss listen and talk about what i wanted for my hair which i greatly appreciated
i got a manicure and a pedicure they were both done extremely well
you get a walk through of how to maximize your experience
2 they dont use new file boards once my pedi started but before he started filing at my toenails i noticed that there were white scrapes on both front and back of the file board
very quick efficient and professional
i cant have anything touch them because of the pain
its just close to the house but after this time i am not going back
horrible horrible experience here
yes it is off the strip but only about 20 minute drive away
well then i should have been informed that i might not have any volume to my hair if i dont have natural curl
although we were disappointed we decided we could make that work and went down to the pool at 230  we had been traveling all day with small children and tried to order them lunch we already had dinner arrangements
great scenery as you pull up to the hotel
the prices are pretty reasonable
i also was not happy with the treatments
decided to check out this place after yelp reviews
i came here after work because it was close to me
he said it would be wonderful and it was
she did the most amazing sombre on me and i am in love
its like walking into a bit of a dream world
bought a perfume and there was no line
we will not ever return to this salon
they truly have their clients best interest at heart
waited 1 hour to never get service
smoking in casino is choking
very poor business ethics
as ive seen in other reviews i paid extra to do the monthtomonth cancelled my membership and they are still charging me
the esthetician was friendly and we chatted during the service which helped pass the time and make it more comfortable
then i found my person
i rarely give a review that is less than 5 stars and actually think this is my first
i never imagined that free hand detailed nail art could look so amazing
can you say grandma life
the rates vary from too expensive to too good to pass up
we had a great experience with the guys at the shop
they arent too dramatic but not too subtle either which was what i wanted
very professional feeling clean facilities
couldve gotten more stars for a better experience because they do great work
the barbers are all friendly and do a great job
holli lacombe has been my stylist for 7 years now and offers in my opinion the best cutcolor ever hands down
gives hair maintenance and growth tips
i was pleasantly surprised at how quickly i was seen
i asked his opinion on previous injections and future procedures and he is a saint and spent about 30 minutes answering my annoying questions and didnt try to up sell me on anything
we got in very early and they let us check in before noon without any prodding though we did get a super low floor which was a fine trade at that point
overall experience  the service felt extremely rushed like she couldnt wait to get me out of there
check out the ring finger sparkle
irritation was pretty minor overall and went away within 2 days
not a single ingrown hair
the hairstylist simply told me they all had their own stations and she couldnt do anything about it
unfortunately all of this unfolded in front of my dad who is visiting from india for few days and im sad that hell leave with the wrong impression of an otherwise superb city
i found this business on groupon
worst nail place ever
nails came out looking exactly how i wanted them and im very picky on my nails
i loved my experience with tori
presto changeo i was new man with hair gel and all
theres some tacky halloween stuff out now like mugs with fake rat tails sticking out of them which spin when you pick them up
kc hands down gave me the best massage of my life
finally found a salon that i actually like and they communicate to make sure i get what i want
one must pay a hefty daily price to use their spa
zen foot spa has newer amenities as compared to the foot spa location
was i paying for just a touch up
dont think id go back
sincerely a very disappointed customer
when we walked in the door we were warmly greeted and offered a seat
i specifically made sure that they knew that i wanted it  blow dried
spa review the front desk people are friendly and a pleasure to deal with
the hotel does not wreak of smoke
to start the water was ice cold he didnt scrub my feet good light pressure and not long only rubbed my legs didnt touch my feet only put one coat of color i had to ask for a 2nd coat
i have even been told by a close friend that he feels was turned down for a job and blames it on his haircut from supercuts in sq
great service  for a very reasonable price
hes the best of the best as far as sephora is concerned
they are absolutely amazing and always readily available for questions i may have
the duration of the scrub was so fast
i got a fantastic haircut that lasted 8 weeks
nice affordable day spa in vegas
theyre very busy but always wellmannered so an appointment must be made
the remainder of the staff always makes you feel very welcome and at ease even as a guy going into a spa
but not in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable
after 20 minutes of the girl searching in the back for receipts she said looks like theres no receipt so unfortunately im going to go ahead and credit your bill
very very good experience every muscle was touched
all of their barbers do a wonderful job at fades and precision cuts that every presentable man needs
thanks so much michelle
i ended up here by accident and it was the best accident ever
and the paint looked like a 3rd grader painted
the last two times i was there the customer service was just downright bad
i am in love with my hair
fortunately i actually scheduled a hair appointment with rsalon after i left ulta and was penciled in before work
so when a group of seasoned yelpers decided to take vegas up on her tempting flirtations i was skeptical
go to kayla at z salon instead
i was at this barbara hop the barbar gay was very friendly also best barbar shop in town i always walk away barbers unhappy but this barber makes me happy every time i go to his barber shop
i wish i could say i got something for these reviews but its honest to goodness just that good
i have come to see brijette for the last 2 to 3 months she is a very professional lady she have help my skin so much i used to have problems with acne and white and black heads i pretty much try everything before coming to her and nothing work  i highly recommended her   i also go to michell oh man what can i say she is the best i love getting manicure and pedicure from her i wish i had a lot of money to go to see her every week lol  i highly recommend these two ladies
i also love that they use bumble  bumble products
do some peoplewatching on queen st through the windows while you get your hair cut
i love this place btw
so i recommend the thai but they also do traditional deep tissue and swedish massage
ill be making a doctor appointment tomorrow and i know that i am loosing my nail
that seems extremely unsanitary to me
every time i got up to show her i noticed her work station was gross
there were 2 of us and we were able to get our massages in the same room
i decided to give it a shot
at that point i would have given it 4 stars as i rarely hand out 5 the second time i went in was the icing on the cake
pretty and clean place too
its a cool place full of hip people
welcome to vegas megan
i am 40 years old my mommy doesnt need to book my appointments for me
after moving to arizona from out of state i didnt know where to go for botox and fillers
i dont mind spending the money for great service and my stylist was ok
the reason for the 1 star was that when i paid i left her a 5 tip
that along with the 20 scratcher at the register saved us money on the things we really needed
i love this salon  highly recommend cece
it wouldnt be such a bummer if it didnt cost 75 for the whole disappointing experience
the woman who greeted us was of course asian
the other artist do great work too and theyve always been incredibly friendly
i looked up at the clock while my nails were drying and it was almost 8
the manager  who wont tell me her name  told me off now two times
everyone is so nice and kind i went in to get a brazilian with chantelle and she is so amazing and sweet it was my first time and she made me feel so comfortable and relaxed
should have known better but i needed a manipedi bad
im on a monthly membership and that includes lash fills every two weeks
we had a kitchenette a living room with a pullout queen sized sofa a king size bed with sliding doors and a huge restroom
his topcoat was bubbly and he rushed so much that the second coat didnt even fully cover each nail
i wish i would have read the reviews first
she doesnt use a drill on your nails  doesnt use acetone
the staff is friendly and knowledgeable
kim does an excellent job maintaining my manicure pedicure and eyelash extension
brenda did a color highlight cut and style on my hair
room service was friendly
i am very happy with the results and investment
the ladies helped us find everything we needed then we went to fat tuesdays right next door
my face was glowing after my facial
most of all she is a perfectionist
those warm stones were freaking awesome
however what i did not expect was my burgundy hair coloring to wash away after a handful of shampoos and fade to a dull dark brown
but i have cash for the tip
she already knew them
the roman baths were all wonderful
i love that the rooms have a kitchenette so i have the option to make my own meals
the makeup that they applied was amazing
plus the coffee was decent
no help getting up or off the chair
vdara has a nice gym its small but gets the job done
allison has cut my hair for two years
the pedicure room is semiprivate and hosts 4 people the  manicure room also holds four people
im so sick and tired of this store and i am never coming back again
that totally wowed me haha
amanda was definitely not interested when i tried to engage her in conversation
all u can eat raw oysters and fresh warmhot crab versus the cold ones at other buffets
ive been to many tanning salons over the years and once i found honey browns i never went to another one again
i felt so horrible and slightly embarrassed
i was told results take a while because the that needling is to provoke collagen and tighten  smooth the skinmaybe i wouldnt notice anything for 34 weeks
i got exactly what i wanted
i love her lashes her facials and her company
i was nervous that id have to fly back home for hair cuts but now that ive found briahna at radically curly i dont have to worry
thanks ken for booking my appointment
also gave me some great styling and product tips
summary good food subpar service
we booked a two room suite for two people which worked well and would be comfortable for up to four people
not three hours after i left the polish on my thumb peeled clean off
we both have curly hair which can be tricky
ive been to the nail lounge a few times now so i think it is fair for me to rate them
ana came out to introduce herself and walk me to her chair
both restaurants are fine
i got the signature massage from lucky and she was fantastic
the beds are always comfy with nice soft sheets the room has a fridge  microwave along with a kitchen area and a living room area
thank you kristi
as they were clipping my nails they cut my finger and just kept on going as if nothing happened
she is a very nice lady but can be a bit unprofessional
she said ok  i layer on table and she started
the girls are pretty nice but i got my nails done with one of the guys and he was very impatient and he didnt follow instructions
i got my first and third tattoo here
you cant beat that
this is the original brazilian hair treatment and denise has the years of experience and product knowledge that gets you the look
danke an das team
this is absolutely the best organic spray tan service in las vegas
the casino seems smoke free and impresses all the visitors we introduce to it
i cant remember when my skin looked this good
there was even a homeless person who walked in and made a scene
i send everyone i know here never heard one bad thing
very pretty and the price isnt too high although is pay it either way bc i love my nails
if you are looking for a nice hotel to stay at definitely check this one out
it was great
this is the google review i wrote on our experience
he stated that that was why he didnt want the boxes opened
i saw two pedicure chairs and two nail stations and except for us the place was emptywho knows
fairly clean nail and pedicure work is okay so far since i have only had it for 3 days
lots of free parking
i have followed her to different salons for many years
stephanie did my cut and color and put all of my fears to rest
she is always on time and her attention to detail is impeccable
however i wasnt impressed by the owner lisa
there are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall
lily was great and did my brows last minute
i even scheduled a follow up appointment in 2 weeks because i like her so much
the suite comes with a fridge sink and all your very basic kitchen amenities
never going back and i suggest you stay away too
2  he did leave the room a couple of times to get foot soak water and hot towels
the quality is great  sharp and clean edges to the polish and a nice finish
after my fill i headed to lindas station
dear jessica mcintire is my favorite stylist she is the best
ive been in for tons of mani pedis and everyone has been great
the spa was not zen at all
ive been following jenna for years
i had the special  chicken banh mi  12
someone recommend david to me i dont even live in this area but i made a 30 minute drive just to see david
hubby thought it would be a good idea to go cheap
second the place was far from clean
they are getting ready to move over to san tan village in between barnes and noble  brio which is perfect for me because its even closer to home
ive been looking around for a new nail salon and its super close to home
some good eats there from the lower end panda express food court type stuff to a higher end steakhouse
im from los angeles and next time im in vegas i will be booking with her
compared to waxing i find threading less painless and more effective
cant even name them all
all the stylists were yelling at me embarrassing me in front of other customers
the espresso was burnt
if youre looking for a brazilian wax threading or facials i highly recommend this wonderful woman to you
also they talk to you so if youre the kind of person who wants to just do your own thing and read a book thats not really the case here
up to the 24th floor and boom
just be careful and bring cash
love this place
i will never go to anyone else in toronto
there was only one person in the salon who was doing someones hair so i figured i was in for a wait
ive been coming here for a few months and a new lady did my eyebrows today
they offered up complimentary drinks and immediately started pampering us
daughtry was a total melt down with no bartenders
a nice sleek and modern looking shop with lots of great old school man cave touches like swords and rustic textures on the wall
they were phenomenal and we will definitely be returning for them
she is very good at what she does
youre not going to wait without being addressed you wont have to sit and feel as if youre being forgotten you will get what youre after and youll still get an honest consult
i have recently lost a lot of fat in my face
on my way out i learned that they have specials for massages and other facial services
my hair was pretty and looked great at first but fell very flat by the time i arrived at ceremony an hr or two later
they always find a way to accommodate me even if i change what i want last minute
i highly recommend rachelle
i am glad that i choose her to do my makeup on my special occasion
most definitely returning
i love it
alana had everything necessary for gorgeous makeup and had lashes for everyone
back in june i had fritz do a flower design i brought in on my ribs and even though it didnt match their usual style it turned out wonderful and healed super fast
weve played around with a lot of different color and there isnt anything she has done that i havent loved
i love my tan
they give the best pedicure
not this time anyway
looked at some of the work and called to make an appointment
definitely would recommend to anyone needing hair removal
she inspired so much confidence that i had to immediately set up an appointment for her to cut my daughters hair as well
came in from cali and me and my best friend wanted matching tattoos and we checked yelp reviews and this place had the best so we went in and felt comfortable rite away jay did both of ours it was a great experience i will definitely come back here to get more
she was very reassuring and confident of her abilities to help my hair get back to a natural tone
there are no major bells and whistles but this place definitely gets the job donewell
i came here recently when i was in the area after getting out of work early last friday
the bathroom area was large with a long counter
im delighted to have finally tried body and soul and will definitely be going back
crystal is the very best
free smore kits for little and big kids to use in the fire pits at night
you wont be disappointed here i promise you
a plus was how great my skin looked the next day
never had a complaint with her
they open at 9am which was super helpful when my friend and i had a million errands before a bachelorette
virginia is so good that i actually followed her here when she came over from another spa
tallia not sure if im spelling that correctly took her time and did a fantastic job
dont know if its independently run
my eyebrows always look beautiful at the end
i iced a lot and had my mom fly in town to take care of me
we enjoyed our stay and at the rate we payed we would gladly return
overall i can not imagine anyone else cutting or coloring my hair
sign me up
my stylist asked me what i really wanted and i told her that back to blonde was my goal
we went in and told them that we wanted a gel manicure and i pointed out to the sign on the door
i am very pleased with my boobs and how the surgery went
two artists won awards at the 2016 scottish tattoo convention
quality has diminished since i started coming here about a year ago
i highly recommend this place and the staff was very friendly which made for an even more pleasant experience
the customer service here is a rarity
i normally when i go to a spa try to experiment with different technicians to see who i like the best but theres no way im doing that im sticking with mimi
i was shocked i paid 59 and left 15 gratuity and my facial was not even finished
nails i got shellac mani and considering its spa standards and prices i was disappointed
her attention was on me and her service impeccable
she will nake your nail dreams come true
super friendly staff a fully stocked location always be prepared
plus she didnt put any lotion on me after and im sensitive skinned
my only complaint and they know it is they could be less aggressive when knocking on the door
and that is for a reason
she worked her magic and gave me a natural ashy ombre
so when we were done with the pedi she wrapped my nails in the acetone cotton with the foil on them
what a customer service attitude
theyre priced lower than many other places read reasonably though not at the expense of polite staff or clean facilities
and friendly and cute
fifth star withheld because i didnt get to actually use the pool or test out room service
waaaaaay above average
the pedi seemed very rushed and the massage portionusually my favorite part was literally about 45 seconds per leg
i actually changed my mind on how i wanted my hair to look like
this was my first time going to a massage spa so i cant really compare it to anywhere else but my overall experience was just ok  the massage felt awesome but yes all the employees there talk during the massage and answer phone calls and still attempt to massage you with one hand
the conditioner is like an in shower lotion which is great if youre short on time
an hour later i felt like a new person
someone mentioned that they have raised the price
ill have to write about how amazing my facial was later
he gave me a full balayage and i am absolutely in love
after describing my situation one of the very knowledgeable workers informed me that all mascara has this pesky ingredient
its also nice as it gets rid of those pesky hair bits that often wind up all over you after a haircut
and the shop is very cluttered and actually plan filthy you can see the dust and grime on all the tables like they never wipe anything down
it was ok but i will be going back to quabaths at casears palace next time i want a massage and a spa experience
i love  coming here they go a above a beyond
wendy did my hair and she was a very nice person  i guess if you want james to do your hair you have to wait a couple of days tho the shampoo they use is bain de terre green meadow
the most recent trip he got a terrible cut
i love my tattoo
i came in for a brazilian keritan treatment
when i told her that she had charged me for a 90min and i had only had a 60min she informed me that she would have to call down her manager to refund the 35
so anyway this time around i did some research and found raul in an online search
prices are very reasonable and i will be back
as if she was prepared to give me the 20 off without asking anyone there
i just had a gel manicure and spa pedicure from nikki at salon nouveau
the first time i went in there got a lip and eyebrow deal because its cheaper the first time i got attitude and if i knew it was gonna be like this wouldnt have bought the deal and the second time i grew out my eyebrows just so i can have them done the way i wanted to i went in at 644 on a thursday 121516 and i clearly told the lady that i want my eyebrows thin long and straight meaning not curved in by the nose area she said ok but didnt do as i asked i had to ask her to fix them twice and i could tell that she didnt like that and quote told me you want me to take off all your eyebrows
i was extremely lucky they had an opening that day so i took an appointment
they rubbed a few lotionish things on and wiped em off
ive never been pressured for extra money
no big deal
i bought some cap toothpaste with cool flavour a very practical product for travelling as its not a minitoothpaste tube and way smaller
maybe ill just stick to sephora since ive literally never had to search for a tester there and it is always clean no matter which location and actual drugstores for the cheaper brands since ulta tends to mark those items up a few dollars anyways  im just a little frustrated overall
my nails look great
3 this was our first time staying on the first floor and i was amazed at how much noise you hear from the upstairs neighbors
well ive got 25 reasons that says youre either lying or you did a shitty job
100  the best in chandler  ive gone to many other salons and im from chicago and i thought i had the best nail tech i was wrong when i moved here and found this salon i was blown away
giving me a massage with no gloves passing on her sickness to me
not welcoming at all
im just not happy with the quality of service
i always ask for tiffany as she always does such a great job and the girl is always smiling
used to be a decent place to get eyebrows  upper lip threading done at a fair price
after speaking with dave i knew i had found my guy
its an old house that theyve painted to be colorful with different stylist in each room
this keeps my ass on the equipment for worthwhile amounts of time
i ask for jack
i called the salon and was courteous to ask if there is a charge for a haircut correction perhaps i shouldve been the angry customer demanding a refund  rep aware i was there recently
dont waste your time or money
i will not be returning to her store and ive found another eyelash technician to do my lashes
i moved here from dallas really hesitant to try anyone new
the service during dinner was atrocious
and i did kind of get the thisisabittoohipforme vibe that other yelpers described the atmosphere was very warm and welcoming and you totally get what you pay for
if anyone is having a hard time getting any information about future treatments other than me
after she went over pricing i said i wanted to see if i could get in now she said their last appointment is at 6 so no they could not
however i have been a client of skin studio for over 10 years
good service but poor quality of gel for manicures for the expensive price
and the colour was a really weird brown colour
i ended up having my makeup done by mandy who actually works for too faced not sephora and it was the best makeover ive ever had
in spite of this fabulous ring on my finger i shun at showing it to people because of my gross nails
my friend loved it so much she wanted to purchase whatever air freshener they use but never got around to asking
best service of any nail place in the valley
i received a color treatment from madison who seemed like she was still in training and if im paying 180 dollars for a cut and color please set up the appointment with someone who knows how to perform at a high caliber and doesnt have to ask another more experienced hair stylist to assist them with their job because all she did was the color and couldnt cut my hair because she was timid and not confident in her abilities on performing a choppy bang and i specifically asked for highlights to the front portion of my bangs which she also didnt provide and i wasnt going to be there another four hours for her to fix what she didnt do
the large windows and bright light coming in expose all the happenings on king street west
i think this has been my favorite my hair has ever looked
my nail tech was t she was super sweet fast and all around amazing thank u for ur service i will see u soon
i must say i was pleasantly surprised the man who did my nails did a better job than who i go to in maryland
last time i ate here the miso smelled awful and fishy the albacore was slimy with a bloody back and really nothing tastes fresh
and the massage chairs
they send someone up we open the door and the roach is gone
def worth the extra few dollars
i have suggested this place to many of my friends who have also had great experiences
summary a real destination place amazing variety of crystals authentic people my second home
prices are very fair also
finally he got a good hair cut
i loved that it was so close to shopping areas and restaurants and our room was very clean and comfy for our family of 6
planet fitness is charging you a 4900 annual fee for maintenance costs and another 5800 cancellation fee if you dont see out the entire contract
the location on the strip is great
everyone loved it immediately
room 455 stars  the deluxe room is a pretty spacious suite with a decent size kitchenette and separate dining area
on my way out though i went to the front desk to inform the clerks of this and was treated like an unwanted partycrasher and not someone who had just spent a fortune for a few hours of bathing and beautifying
instead i will be going to nails of the world on val vista and elliot in the safeway complex
the barbers were nice and the locals hanging out waiting for their services made the trip worthwhile
i have 2 amazing professionals to write about
garry also offers specials and packages throughout the year plus referral bonuses
if you get a facial or massage there you can use their facility all day from 530 am to 8 pm  it includes the coed pool sauna steam room hotstone room himalayan salt room and jacuzzi
classes must be good because they get great attendance from what i could see
minus 1 star
there wasnt even anyone there besides me so i dont understand the rush
i have been suffering from migraines and headaches
when we arrived the room was not ready and we waited for 20 minutes
i wanted to get a previous tattoo that i had gotten somewhere else fixed and add some to it
there was a steady flow but everyone working was friendly professional and helpful
i also felt very rushed keiko was a few minutes late whereas i was 510 mins early as they requested
ive gotten dozens of facials in the last decade and this was one of the tops
selection my con is the selection of colors im use to having about 100 gelish or opi gel colors to choose from however they have a smaller collection of colors so it limits your options if you are bold and daring like myself
the people here are pretty helpful when i am looking for something
i never thought i would love againanother hair stylist that is i didnt know it was possible to love a salon or group of stylists as much as i love everyone at alchemy
i have referred 4 people and they all loved it too
they last over 3 weeks if i get a french that doesnt show how much its grown outplus shes a hoot to talk to
i came in with my aunt a few weeks ago for pedicures at this salon
okay when the massager comes out with the barrel of hot water to soak your feet in she decides to talk with our next door neighbour beside me
i was new to the area and needing an annual skin check
when i arrived to my appointment on time the place was pratically empty
i booked another appointment i am happy to finally have found a quality nail salon
we didnt have to shout over obnoxious music
ive been going there for 2 years and the first time late my appointment gets taken away
get off the strip and try something different in vegas check out some of the surrounding video poker bars in the area if you are a drinker
she offers exceptional service plus an awesome blow out
i left feeling so happy and satisfied
i wasnt crazy about the food except for monday night
my husband made an appointment with riley months ago to get a tattoo during our vacation in vegas
she is pleasant to talk to and she does a great job when it comes to her cuts
when i reminded her that i wanted them shorter and more pointy she told me it was not possible
dr hankins did a breast lift with a breast augmentation under the muscle for me a year and a half ago i was so young with saggy large breasts and i was very self conscious
im feeling refreshed and relaxed
i went to see dr landow to explore the possiblity of juvederm
there was only one barber in the shop  i believe he was the owner
he explain everything and didnt push anything additional
i used to go here a lot a couple of years ago during my hair dying frenzy and what can i say its a hidden gem
really enjoy my monthly massage
she kept referring to an event that she had to go to afterwards as though it was a bother that she had to be doing hair on a saturday morning
i requested a pedi and shellac and tina worked on the pedi and mani then handed off to cindy for the shellac
i wont be going anywhere else from now on and certainly will be sticking with her as my colorist
im very happy with my haircut from jenny
anytime i am in las vegas i make it a point to book a massage with laura even though i routinely get massages back in california
she was able to fix his bad cut from a previous barber which was impressive
she routinely works with kim and loves her attention to detail and how much she seems to enjoy her job
gel manicures are supposed to last at least a week this was it even close
or the other place great clips
she is very accommodating also in making sure they are always perfect
i will come back when im in town
they dont stand for it
i was shocked when each legfoot was at a max 15 seconds
stay away from this place at all costs
i get a text when my stuff is ready and so far its been ready on time fitting with their estimates
their prices are reasonable and have a variety  other services
been going there since 2011
massage and facial were soooo relaxing
great place they are like family
i took them off for a couple of months and yesterday i decided i miss them
the environment is very welcoming clean and also relaxing
she treated my face neck chest and shoulders
when you come to this nail salon you really feel like part of the family which is very hard to find in a nail salon
the lady at the front gave me all the paperwork that needed to be filled out electronically now wow
from california to texas depending on where i am living
just found this place today and am excited to visit rupal regularly now that i live and work nearby
came in for some odd piercingsa fellow by the name of dwayne was kind enough to help me
she addressed both my need to relax and the pain i had in my body
ross was the guy
another thing i really liked was the privacy that we had
i feel like a high roller just looking at this pool and cabanas surrounded by palm trees and clear blue sky i had to take me a dip
this review is based on a conference i attended this week
and i have now followed my stylist to inspire never to go anywhere else
its right behind the pier 1 next to sub factory
no direct access to the strip
and the other girl who i assumed the owner didnt want to give me a receipt only if i give her my full name
i have been back to her numerous times and will continue to be a loyal customer with very pretty blonde hair
whether its your nails wanting a wonderful pedicure or even brow wax  i sincerely recommend you give wendys a try
once she got there she asked which service i was having and assumed i was there for a wax
well on the day of my appointment i walked in and immediately liked kasadee
they are so rude at this place
i wrote a really long review and wonder why the latest review is 9313 when i wrote my review on 10513
lounge chairs are crowded together and we had to fight for a chair every morning because there arent that many
kudos to you all
beautiful facility but my massage left much to be desired
first she cleansed my face twice
melissa is excellant
first time coming here
i have to minus one star because there were empty water bottles everywhere and they seemed shortstaffed and overwhelmed
ill make this short because i am not into bashing people but i wish i had taken the negative comments about her more seriously
then got an incredible pedidicure by bruce
then as if that wasnt enough when i told him i got the job he told me i couldnt pay for my haircuts anymore because i was working for his friends company
she was so down to earth and gave me great skin care information
i had a great experience from painless injections to final outcome
i love it here
the facial was great
i got an acrylic white tip set with gel for 35 and a pedicure with the most perfect bright sunflower design for 27
jan asked me how i wanted my hair cut
is this how you serve your bisque
she was very slow and didnt seem very experienced
i booked and appointment with megan at the lash  sugar company after reading some awesome reviews and she lived up to every expectation and then some
they have a great selection of polish opi cndc china glaze essie  precision colour
gave me a great haircut
i didnt love the set up inside a large chiropractic office environment off a main hallway that people and pts are by passing but it was okaythe privacy and calmingsoothing factor is lacking but the experience is fine and michelle is pleasant
friendly employees helped me with my selections and gave me tips for using the products i bought
i went to make an appointment last week on march 26 2015 and they told me that i did not have any credit
on the first house he visited matt identified a construction problemexisting fire hazard with the vent that must be fixed asap before the dryer can be used and before he can clean it
shes an expert at waxing and her facials are incomparable
brent is an incredibly skilled massage therapist
my experience i also had the coconut blah blah massage
since you wear amber glasses to protect your eyes and have a uv light in your face it is hard to play with your phone or do anything so most people end up just sitting there
itll never dry
shes a perfectionist and wont let you leave with anything less than perfect
however appointments arent necessary
they provide wonderful service
we took an uber to a nearby 2 miles away supermarket vons for groceries they offer free delivery too
it even shows how youre going to progressively age and even how youre going to look
i love that she was open on sunday as it is very convenient for me to go on the weekend
also if you dont use the monthly massages that youre charged for they just collect and you can use them anytime
loyalty all the way
not enough pressure on the massage
i love jude and salon dshayn
he quickly understood my fiances body type and problems by interviewing inspecting and palpating and tailored his session accordingly
cindy really listened to what i wanted and did a great job
from walking in the door and not being acknowledged for five minutes even though i was the only customer while watching the entire staff eat pumpkin bars 20 feet from me to walking out with the most lifeless drab monotone hair after it was foiled
it was downright magical
they also have a small salon in the back
she also does lovely designs when she does my pedis
eyebrow whisperer is right
the same guy at the front tells me the manager has been busy with the opening of a new gym and isnt replying to messages again
i am 95 mo pregnant
i can honestly say it was the best massage i have ever had and i normally get deep tissue
the cut ended up being very good quality
i have been in town for over 40 years so i know whats up
she really knows what she is doing as a colourist and cut and style
mil had a pedicure and her toe nails dropped off a few weeks later because she contracted a fungus from the poorly cleaned utensils
welp looks like ill be growing them out again for another month
there are no words
i cannot thank jessica and sara enough for helping me and making me feel welcome
thirty minutes later he says take a look
i look forward to referring them to my wife too
after wards i slipped into the robe and slippers and hung out in the waiting lounge
i left vegas for awhile and had to get my hair done across the country for a while and it was a disaster
however after dining here the other night i was pleasantly surprised
no enough tip
i searched for a massage therapist on yelp and bought their coupon special
this place is so awesomei highly recommend it
kristy takes the time of day to have a through consultation and she got a personality thats just as amazing as her talent
i will recommend him to everyone i know and will definitely use him again
they keep track of how many times you go there and on the 5th visit you get 15 off
however the gc for the hair services was not actually in the basket
its getting warm and that means its time to crash some pools
he said that he was a medical therapist so all is ok he pressed extremely hard on my neck spine and base of skull
the tech i got paired with has potential but needs more practice before actually working on clients
kevin was fantastic and i would highly recommend him for wedding hair and makeup
jonny knows exact formulas to keep that brassiness out and to ensure that you get that beigewhite blonde you are looking for none of that orange blonde  you know what im talking about puke
i may be a little generous with my positive review because it was my first time to a foot spa but i left feeling great
the stylist are very sweet and ive never seen one get flustered at a screaming child
ive got him a few times and if youve ever gone to a barber you will instantly understand why this guy has a long way to go before he is a real barber
she went on for several minutes about it and i finally told her i didnt need advice because i wouldnt be buying it againwhy would i spend so much on a product that is so easily ruined
will never go back i dont want a staff infection
she taught me all about vegas about the on stripoff strip culture and the economy all if which are topics i did interesting and in which she was well versed
i highly recommend laura for all that ails you
i love this gym i am a bit younger then the folks i see here but i love it
prices are great
the spa was so relaxing and i was treated very well
she sat back and continued to mess with her iphone
i will definitely be back
we decided to drive to the store and look ourselves and lo and behold there were 10 left in the size we needed
they have a good thing going at parlour
i mean they look ok from afar but for 50 they should look amazing
not only is he friendly he gives a great cut and is fast
it was wonderful
in and out quick
need to give it one more star as my experience gets better and better
that explains why i had to wait so long in the lobby when i checked in and i checked out because they have people stopping by to make appointments but they only have one person working
i walked to this sweet little spot and had a wonderful pedicure
so many things went wrong ahead of our visit some our fault some theirs and the ladies at alexus just smoothed it all over gave my mom and my sister and i a seamless amazing pampered experience for my moms birthday without any issue
seriously rebecca is out of this world amazing  shes knowledgeable in her trade and really taught me so much about my skin
horrible customer service
i started out with the waxing
nini is the absolute best
if you shave before you go in they cant really tell where your hair begins and ends so sometimes they end up zapping you where there was never any hair in the first place which in return causes new hair to grow in places where hair wasnt previously located sighonce they get it right though if you have the patience and temperament they are good to go
the worst thing of it all while my friend was getting her nails done one of the girls came and spoke in their language
more imporantly the therapists are great though i should note that ive only had appointments with kristyn and grace but i have no reason to believe the others arent as great
the 30min manicure is 28
he even cut my cuticles
they usually put all the new games in front of the buffet and around the drop bar
that was really gross
btw the address is clearly marked on the building and on the rest of the buildings in the area you would have to be a complete moron not to find it
valet service and a gated entrance each time you come and goloved it
go here and you wont need to look any further
all you had to tell me was that it didnt work for the halloween special
there was steam though
ive had the asian guy brian i think his name is do my nails and he does a good job
i would not recommend this place
cashier tonya started the speak condescendingly thats the price to her and then the girls began to have a passive aggressive argument
take it from meim a current chiropractic student
a recommendation also is that you should not allow customers to use their cell phone while they are getting a haircut
i went in to get henna on my chest and i told sara she could free hand a design for me
i would not recommend this salon to anyone as you are charged the same prices for custom nail art in other salons and are treated like a customer not like you are doing a favor for a friend in beauty school
i went in for my first mystic tan and girl who worked there took me through it step by step and she was so sweet
this wasnt what i asked for and we werent interested in a foot massage
i highly recommend him to anyone looking for an a stylist
70 for a gel mani and pedi
nice  clean
i found her via a groupon after trying three of four other salons
experience2 they offered me a complimentary manicure  pedicure because of my initial experience very smart great customer service decision
he barely worked on my lower back and more my shoulders and upper back
they were 1 nails as the service and prices were great
the skin is now layered with a blood spot
weve always been treated professionally and with care
great atmosphere and the view upstairs where you get your nails done is pretty cool as well
they look perfect and he was able to bring new life into something that i thought was completely dead
i was pretty disappointed
for the effort he puts in and the time he spends on your hair 15 is a steal
they treat you like family and do a great job
on more than one occasion ive had to ask the technician to please clean up the nail and cuticle clippings as well as change the towel
the food was absolute shit
pat is efficient and respectable of every clients time
i almost fell asleep
i went in and told them i wanted a manicure and a full acrylic set
this was going to be my first shellacgel manicure because i have heard nothing but good things about them
my friends polish is painted uneven because they were in such a hury and didnt care about us
she is very knowledgable knows how to talk you off the ledge and takes the time to explain hair stuff and the end result just amazing when it comes to funky colors she knows her stuff
i plan on coming back regularly for my nail needs
i love and highly recommend brittany she is amazingly talent at dying hair
this place used to be my favorite nail salon in vegas but after what happened today im never going back again
all them niccas killin it in there
one thing that i wish they would change is the chairs in the hair wash station
definitely recommend camille
i would highly recommend this studio and the ladies alisha and kate as they were both fantastic
especially since the quality of work is so high
melanie is truly amazing
and thats exactly what i got
in addtion the salon is very community oriented
highly recommend shawn for your eyelashes
it helps heel any cracked or chapped lips within minutes
super clean and bright store and very well organized
i was impressed so much the first time i was pumping up a tire and the inflating hose blew off slamming me in my hand
i chose my colors and was treated to an excellent pedicure that culminated in a hot stone foot massagethen i was directed to a manicure table where she gave me one of the best manicures ive had in years
xhenis is a fantastic stylist to work with
i am a single mom and a bartender so it says a lot if i can go that long between
when i was about to head in  jenny happened to be outside and held the door open for me
i dont think they need more technology unless its for a more advanced facial
that was 1 now finally my turn
didnt even direct me to the nail dryer which was just a uv light
i changed into my robe and took a walk around
7 dont pick at your lashes
the people that work here are great and the managers are down to earth and are genuine when it comes to caring about the employees and guests
i told her what i wanted and she summoned the artist austin from the back
three things that bothered me about my visit and would cause me to never return to jade nail  spa  1 tardiness 2 rudeness and 3 quality
especially the blonde barber that works there horrible
thank youi will be back
i will follow her wherever she goes
after husband argue with olivia she only returned 8000
found studio 21 and from entering the building everyone was so nice
they just lost a customer
when i get a gel manicure done at other places they last at least two weeks
i live an hr away from toronto and ive tried many different places before but none can compare to petals so i drive an hr just to get it done by lynda
so glad i did
i received athletes foot after a pedicure here once
ofcourse she wanted to start trying to be nice towards the end when she knew it was time to get paid and get a tip
my surgery went so smooth and was the easiest thing
their service folks are pleasant and professional but their pricing can be 2  3 xs more expensive then other good companies
no better salon for color or curly hair
how unprofessional that they do not get back to their clients
do not bother
i have been back since and have had great experience since that last visit
beth did an amazing job on our first hennas and i think we are both hooked on hennas now
its clean and the therapists are consistently good
yes they do i always get a gel manicure and gel pedicure and they have so many colors to choose from
quality is not good
there must be twenty different combinations of view suite and size with undescriptive names and although ive booked a dozen times i always struggle with figuring out which is what
basically speaking its the best off the strip casino
i was on this side of town and opted for something newnow i know
i see others calling her out with her responding that she didnt even make an appointment with them
deb is an acrylic nail genius most shops around the area glue these cheap plastic tips onto your fingers before applying acrylic whereas deb does acrylic sculpting building your acrylic tip up by hand preventing the weakness that comes with the water solubility of super glue
lily is the real deal with a cherry on top
lines look great and it was a mere 33 for both
i found out that the spa services is a separate programschool so im hoping those students would do a better job than this girl that is focusing on hair
such nice service and the products are heavenly especially the vitamin c serum and the bald onyx mask
my daughter got a great hair cut and had a great time
cant say enough great things about this place
the yoga classes are awesome
this time the length was better but it never really sat right
on the plus side they have a loyalty card and coupons that can be found in the newspaper or online
beware of that clause if you are going to sign the membership
rick is my color specialist and worked with me to find the right color fit
just be sure to book in advance
im not impressed at all
you get 20 off of any lotion no matter what tanning package you decide on
thank you for making going to the doctor an actually pleasant experience
if i could give a zero i would
again nobody greeted me
coming back asap
my girlfriend took me here for my very first pedicure
so we agreed to hear more about the program in another roomoffice
not only did it smell wonderful it was so relaxing
they do great work
im not a fancy girl by any means but i do most certainly enjoy a fancy thing or two once in a while
10122013  paid for a power wrap and light therapy
i have been going to her for the last year and she is always more than willing to listen to my concerns needs and always does a fantastic job
only place in ti to get food late they are open 24 hours
they are quick to serve you too
so now i have to wear false eyelashes for the next 2 months so that i dont look like i had chemo
i highly recommend amelia  co to anyone looking for a stress free and glamorous hair and makeup appointment for any occasion
i stayed two nights and would recommend it
kim is the worst
i got a phone call within a couple of days from the manager apologizing and offering a refund
she lays it out honestly and doesnt beat around the bush which i appreciate
tip they dont let you tip through credit card so bring some dolla dolla bills to tip your stylist
the rooms are decent look clean and weve never had a problem with them
positives  1 there are few other nailspa pedicurewaxing places in the area
so after reading many raving reviews i decided to give aveda a try
very friendly staff
im currently planning my next trip and i will definitely be staying at the vdara again
she was selling shampoo and conditioner too which in my mind  i would need anyways so although expensive price was 24 each 48 total for shampoo and cond okay i will buy
however  i was out in 1 hour 40 minutes
you make me love to workout and be consistent in getting to the gym
gel mani with bio seaweed gel was 35  10 for design
i couldnt have asked for a better massage therapist
it was perfect for a wedding in vegas but not so much that i didnt feel like myself
this is the only place i would go for my b12 shots
i have curly hair and i get nervous because there seems to be lacking education in dealing with curls
just got my nipples pierced by shane never thought id ever say that lol hes professional made me feel comfortable and he was quick
dennoch macht es spass hier entspannt zu shoppen und auch ein paar euros auszugeben
all of the employees were super nice and friendly
had my first and last pedicure there
lucky lucky me
sidney and siena are an amazing team
surprised me that they do a complimentary shoulder rub while you wait for your pedicure to dry
i then told frank about the grey not being covered he stated well its highlights i told him that at the school they always touch up the roots and color the grey he continued on with the cut and throughout the entire cut he used a razor to cut my hair a total chophack job pretty bad
i was very surprised because the storefront seemed rather small
ive gone from airhead to no call backs to not booking properly to straight up being hung up on for asking basic questions
so in all i spent 70 including pedi for one nail to last not even 24 hours and the other two lasted 3 days
just went for my first wax today
i popped in on my lunch break and i was able to get a pedicure 5 minutes later
my feet were bleeding and the instructor looked at them and said good job
i said i would think about it and left
the salon was also very pretty and relaxing
i booked my facial appointment with jess and bridget
but my tech alexa was really nice
i had my hair cut yesterday from one of those generic costcutter places and had a blah hair cut
just beware if you go here
nothing beats quilaity work so close to home
it certainly wasnt nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort
there is a jade room red clay hut room red clay ball room salt room saltherbal steam room hotwarmcold jacuzzi and an ice room
ok  heres the thing
not sure who in a previous review asked for a tip thats weird its never happened to me
it looked great all night and did not feel like it was caked in hair products
i dont think we will be going back there
5 after she steamed my face for 20 minutes she did the extraction
but getting used to it
no eye contact
ive been searching forever for a place where i can just ask for a refill and thats the end of the conversation
my sister wanted her to justifiy why they would put 8n in my hair  her response was oh you must be one of those who only adds breakage to hair to which my sister said no im one of those that gets it right the first timenow my sister will have to have another process which will cause breakageyou dont guess what chemicals to use on someones head  you should be reported
they gave us an option to but did not like other places push it to get you to buy it
linda is a lovely lady and she knows what she is doing
so sweet  asks me lots of questions so she understood exactly what i wanted
one thing that i found odd was that they had theyre dogs in the salon didnt bother me but i found it non professional
all of the girls are friendly professional all the while making you feel like you are part of their family
fantastic service and extremely affordable
i have recommended starry glow to a number of coworkers and friends
the price is slightly above average but it is totally worth it  i am usually concerned with my cuticle but sun shes the owner is the best with it
and man was i missing out for 24 years
it is her birthday today and one of her favorite things is dove dark chocolate
oh and they have extended their hours and are open pretty late in the evening which is really awesome
i felt bad for her as she looked incredibly apologetic to the line up of customers waiting to pay but probably felt as if she couldnt tell the owner to shut up for a minute
he is amazing and understands exactly how i want my hair cut
that alone is not a flattering nail salon practice because its not good for the skin
the next day i definitely felt a bit sore but it has been a month since my massage and i still feel a lot better than i had before my massage
we sat by the pool for part of the last full day there
she has a phenomenal reputation on yelp
i would recommend tan factory instead  i had a lovely experience and a beautiful tan afterwords with no burning
he asked me to speak with the floor manager the next time i am in
the employees are extremely rude
first your system of checking people in is a little ridiculous
she is so nice and knows what she is doing
she tried to charge me an extra 20 letting me know halfway through the appointment of the extra charge because i had a lot of eyelashes
they then moved to polish 3 and i followed
they did not
do i leave
i flew in from canada to get hair extensions
everyone is friendly
i scheduled my appointment for may 11 weeks ago
though sometimes you do have to wait the wait is never excessive or walkout worthy and the prices are competitive
i have waited 30 minutes at other resorts
eddie is an amazing artist
i have no doubt i made the right choice
it felt like a warm bath of oil and i felt cocooned and safe and completely utterly relaxed
i may continue to come here though
the last time i let another guy cut my hair as he didnt have a client at the time and he scalped me
i cant even begin to thank the staff there
katie is amazing and hit every sore spot and did some serious stress and tension relieving in my shoulder and neck area
they used cnd shellac which some salons say this use but dont
everyone was extremely nice
they had decided against my asking to dye it a neon bluish purple
the place is also very nicely decorated
so happy to have found this place
i went with the intention of getting my husband a day of spoiling
she was super sweet and very good at her craft
they may attend to other customers while with you though
in addition there were waitresses who came around to get drink orders
bota bota is a complicated spa to review because it really depends on what youre looking for
its worth every penny
if they keep up that kind or service i give them 6 months tops
i recommend everyone try this day spa solely on the fact that it is being run by a very exceptional individual
2 the exfoliating tool they use is just a foam scrub as opposed to a grater
their customer service is absolutely horrible
this add on was 20 btw
he worked across from tiffany for years
i believe that nikki is in the business for the right reasons and the people who are working for her seem happy and interested in what they are doing and concerned about the clients health
i decided to go for bangs and then he spoke a word that i shouldnt
i wanted to love it with my whole heart
the medspa and staff are very professional as well thank you lisa and elenor
after coming in every 23 weeks for the past 5 months i must say i could not be happier with nohea nails
after they are done threading they put this aloe vera type cream to help ease the redness and pain
where do i begin okay i walk in and immediately greeted which was lovely
the line ups say it all
going on to the manicure i asked for a normal manicure and the girl tried hard to push their gel manicure which seems to be their thing according to other yelp reviews
sleeping rooms were just okay
i had no clue what to dohow to do it so i could only give angela some general preferences and left the rest up to her
all the staff deserve 5 stars
the reviews match the experience
i had showed him a picture and it was the same cut i always got
the space looks great
highly recommend her services
wasnt even asked if i wanted a shave
there were no restrooms conveniently located out by the adult pool we had to dry off and walk back into the spa and use the spa restrooms
this yelp is for the best salon in las vegas
but its true
this place was absolutely spectacular
shes friendly personable down to earth and just a well rounded stylist
now i can see where someone impatient people who feel like their needs come before the person who was there first would have a hard time here
i recommend that you try secret nails and ask for linda
plus the nail lady smugged the gel all over my skin
the second time i went jay did them and he was great
i had my nails done pink  white liquid gel here on saturday they looked like a kindergartner painted them and on monday i went back to surprise az to my original guy and had to have him fix everything that was done
thank you brook for  everything your the best
he talked up this big game and said he could work around my work schedule
even the long term employees are gone i think patrick was there since they opened and he left recently
once someone started to work on my nails i told them to only file a bit to shape
i sat down in peters chair for a cut that had been seemingly unattainable from a previous stylist see b suite and peter took the reigns immediately
jessica gave me exactly what i wanted and talked about a game plan to slowly grow out my hair with the utmost enthusiasm
i was a little bit annoyed when she was cleaning around me it took me a while to realize she had to go around me to clean because she didnt mention anything so when i said it in maybe the nicest tone  sorry like am i in your way
betsy is the best she can do it all
i was going to avoid that today with more specific instruction but after their total lack of customer service and bad attitude i will never go back here again
jessica is my stylist
hardly ever a long wait and very tight clean haircuts and fades
considering youre fully clothed it doesnt matter much but it does give more a sense of relaxation
and for the service and treatment you get the prices are not bad
everyone there is very nice and sweet
gel nails and a pedi had me looking all kinds of fly and even little 5 year old diva mica got hooked up with a full on spa pedicure
i dont normally tip that extravagantly but since i got a discount i figured why not after the great experience i received
cared a lot about making me comfortable as well since it was such a touchy spot for a tattoo
then she put an exfoliant mask product on my legs and feet and begin to massage
i received a sample in my birchbox and it is a game changer
i had my first massage early last week
i had thought my mind was made up where i was getting my tattoo done until i met mike and saw his work
when massages were done i got hot towels and a hot stone leg rub down the polish went on and i added a design
my sister and i love it here so much
and the room was awesome
my first trip to dean of shadyside was in the spring of 2005 and ive never looked back
she always makes sure i get the best experience every time i visit
lamontae and the other younger guy are awesome
i will def be going back and requesting lindsay again
i was using a living social deal and thought perhaps i wouldnt get as great a service as a full paying customer as ive previously experienced with some san antonio living socialgroupon deals but no this was amazing
it didnt take away from the design and britney used a purple instead of black for the outline so theres a more naturalgradient look to it
so i would reco on trying maya  and even daisuke show the new guy some love
just next to the popular tao night club
just happened to stop into this place and wow what a great find
it was my first time here
the ent of my eye was missing extensions
every nail is a work of art from the simplest to the most complicated japanese nail art
the basic pedicure was good and relaxing
the classes i have been to where not very crowded
he had no choice but to pay attention to me
cons  glue or something incompatible with me lashes fell off quickly and i had to go back for a fill by the 2 week mark or before the 2 week mark hit when i usually go in 25 to 3 weeks
i have been going to herbal nail bar to get my acrylics and pedicures done for a couple months and i love them
this store has a mish mosh of just about everything
i had my nails done there a couple of years ago and they were yellow
i walked out without getting served
i noticed such a difference after one time
these beautiful ladies are fast friendly
it took almost an entire day researching and narrowing down a hair salon and stylist that i wanted to do my hair
i would highly suggest jill to anyone that is looking for a professional to take care of their hair
do not waste your time or money
after an hour with him i had ranges of motion that i couldnt dream about that morning
shes the best
this place is crammed with tables of techs noisy and just a money maker for the owner with little interest in the client
all this with the client just sitting there
the dr office only puts the address for their records incase they need to fax it to walgreens they have the infornation
when i got to the other room there was a loud fan on i asked him if it could be turned off
hurt like the dickens
i gladly paid my 30 left my service provider a cash tip and then 1 week later a charge for 40 appears on my bank statement
im a huge fan of funke hair body soul
scarlett is a perfectionist when it comes to hair and she took her time when she cut and highlighted my hair and she did not rush at all
tony gave me one of the best gel french tip manicures ive had in a long time
i just had my hair cut and colored here and the space and the staff are amazing
every guy knows that a sloppy fade looks and feels terrible so its imperative that its blended correctly
the massage chairs were okay but strangely positioned to the hair sink so it wasnt really making any contact
which tasted just like grape soda
15 bathrooms one king bed a pullout sofa which sucked  better to sleep on the reg sofa  more cushioning and a kitchen which was perrrrfect for having pre drinking parties
when i first walked into his office i was greeted by the nicest people
ive tried a few different places in the area and this is definitely the best
they could kick it up a notch by offering water coffee or tea while you wait
a simple wash and cut for women runs you 73 before tip
its a hotel room small one doesnt even have a shower what kind of spa doesnt have wraps and scrubs which need a rinse
several staff members stayed on their cell phone  avoided eye contact with customers in the store
the expenses to get there plus the price she provided for the process were significantly less when compared to shops in pheonix for just the lock process
after reading other reviews i did expect better
most nail places file my nails paint them and when i get home realize my nails are all crooked
no where on her price sheet did it say anything about length of hair not even the words starting at 75
furthermore the cost to book at a different hotel was significantly more than what we had booked the room we were in for
the best part is  the company couldnt care less
i thought i had given up looking for a new colorist as my girl moved back to cali but low and behold fate saw me through
im happy he asked me about my thoughts on it
shes also so pleasant to talk to no wonder she has a lot of return clients
and since i didnt have one i would need to come into their store and buy a gift card for the value of my service
i get what is really a trim every 25 weeks
this nail salon is very clean and clientcentered
best place in town
for starters its pretty ghetto  not in the best area
i always call for an apt
had a bit of a mixup but they totally worked it out for me
make sure to call ahead
i feel like my money was wasted
i did have a little bit of a wait when i got there but it wasnt too bad the girls were busy
everyone was very nice and all their patrons seemed equally pleased
sunkissed bottoms is hands down my first choice for a spray tan in las vegas
my feet were soaking in a small wood tub while he massage my scalp arms neck and shoulders
go see cindy semerdjian at cosmetic laser solutions
i hope planet fitness stays this way because i have a feeling it will be a very good gym for me and my boyfriend
maggie trimmed my bangs and i was very disappointed with the result
i was chased out the door after paying almost 200 including tip for myself and my 16 year old daughter
i appreciated how efficient vdara was
not sure what sort of crooked establishment this place is but they have lost me and my circle of friends as a potential customer
they were offering 5 dollars off if me and my friend both did gel so i was asking how much the total would be and if they meant 5 off each person or just one
i was pretty embarrassed because i told my cousin it was a good place
they offer so many nail colors for gels and also offer water if youre parched and need a refreshment
great service and could not be happier
and i did
if i am not next i will be leaving
ill definitely become a regular at this place
request beg and plead for a massage from michael
the it even was too much it says shampoo and blow dry plus style 40 and up i only got styled and paid 70
spoiled laser is a great place to have laser done
great job ladies
i came for a walk in and the artist fucked my shit up
excellent spa truly world class
normally people would give you pricey items so they can increase sales but they helped me choose generic brands that pulled he same result as the high end
she was flexible in working with my schedule
the gal  do not remember her name  that did her hair was so patient with her and did her hair beautifully she even trimmed my bangs  even though i did not have an appt
i didnt really get the lets be bffs from her so i think i will continue my quest to find my favorite hair stylist
from the moment i entered to when i left i felt relaxed
am i on camera
do not go here
the house is brighter and fresher now that i can see clearly through my windows
after reading some other reviews i can see that we are not the only ones that have had this type of experience with this office
i highly recommend you request him
i have sensitive skin so i totally trust her advice when it comes to skin care products recommendations for various peels and the latest in skin treatments whether plastic surgery or some of the less invasive methods
she started to ask me to get up and i asked her do i not get a top coat over the polish
they seat my mom begin working on her gels
and this makes the mind wonder often it can produce feelings of sadness and reminiscing
its not closed down for good they just open at like 10 but i had an appointment with the doctor in that area so i was so upset and i couldnt wait for them to open will quickly be in and out unlike the ones at the mall they take you immediately but the best part is they do a really good job
i really liked it here and will definitely be returning
felt like a bait and switch to me
i was looking for a massage and the place that i was staying at offered massages but i found the prices to be too expensive
i had to wait awhile to get my hair cut
debbie pays attention to every detail listens to your wants  makes great color suggestions and makes it happen
we compromised and he was very mindful to not cut more off than we had discussed
the entrance is so inviting and the space is so open
i loved my experience here and the only thing i couldve changed was just adding more time to my session
when i mentioned this to the girl who cashed me out she said my cuticle had been pushed back and would eventually cover that space
they are amazing ladies
i dont typically write yelp reviews but i feel compelled to in this case
i have no doubt that continued regular treatments will help to ward off coldsflulike symptoms arthritis flareups stress relief aches and pains and likely no exaggeration extend my life
im very picky when it comes to getting my nails done especially when it comes to doing a manicure ive had a very bad experience
i went here yesterday
she worked on my back so well that the next day when i woke up in bed and rolled over to get up my right shoulder muscle said snick
i had an idea of what i was going to dress up for halloween but in typical fashion i changed my mind a few days before the halloween party
they offer me coffee or tea as soon as i walk in the door
the women told me my room wasnt ready
i will forever come to hairs the deal because of how well iam serviced there
i love the whole place
mia was my teeth cleaner
yes she said the wax machine in her room was acting up which explains why sometimes the wax was a bit too hot when she applied it but that didnt explain why she was so impatient about waiting to pull the wax off
mine was rushed and little to no interaction except to try to get me to upgrade to a pedicure even though i was told earlier on the phone no pedicure appointments were available
do not let them put you in room 330 unless you want your clothes to smell like toast or tacos
if you dont prefer to be insulted and talked to as a homeless dog  please pick something else for your vegas overnight
i took a chance and made an appointment with arlene and it was the best chance ive ever taken in my life when it comes to my hair lol she always knows exactly what im looking for and even works her magic to reveal a finished product way more beautiful than i first pictured or hoped it would look like
i have never been treated so poorly by a salon before and i know i will never be going back
all barbers are seasoned professionals that do that old timely straight razor shave that most men are looking for
plus the spice tea was really sexy with the chocolatethere was a party in my tummy so yummy so yummy
easy to set up an appointment and get in and out
overall this is a decent salon however i would rather go somewhere where they do a great job and charge competitive prices
asking me what the student had done wrong and offering me the service with a more experienced student
my nowwife and her family have been coming here for years and even compared to fivestar resorts around the world this is the kind of place that truly screams world class
cracked and peeling paints old wood ceiling trim thats not fully attached because running away from the peeling paint walls all what i was looking at when waiting on the table for the session to begin
there are few things i love more than a great bath and as such ive tried the majority of the bath products available on the market
ive been served by the same hairdresser both my trips and she remembered me the second go round which makes for a pleasant welcome
the other reviewers said it best  qua is a great day spa with experienced therapists and unique amenities that mimic the caledarium tepidarium and frigidarium of the roman baths
5 sarah is fast and efficient without sacrificing quality or kindness
not a fan and unless i have free pass i likely wont be going there again
unfortunately what was supposed to be a holiday treat and necessary prep for a wedding turned out to be a waste of money
i havent tried any classes yet but ive heard that theyre good
you can check out the video here  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvn19moxdtveo the room is super nice with a tub next to the big window looking over to aria the bedroom has windows wrapped around on two sides giving you the best view to aria and the mountains
thank you so much i love them and what a difference in made in my facial features
also been using her defense cream for redness around my nose and chin small red capillaries and i must say after 5 weeks i see a noticeable difference and i used skinceuticals redness cream for years
the employees here are very nice
i usually get a cut and highlights which i have been happy with
do yourself a favor and skip it
they supposedly limit the number of memberships so that there is always equipment available
because it looked as if she might need stitches we went to the taxi stand
while not completely inept to spend 39 on a pedicure male when the only real special request is please make the dry heels smooth and to leave with very rough heels and have to go to the store and buy a ped egg to finish the job with 30 minutes of elbow grease this is a sad commentary on the state of foot care in this country
and i couldnt be more happy with their service
looking back i see that the manicurist spent little time on my nails buffing filing etc
i get there no a single apology from anyone and of course like also the gentleman that works the desk was rude as always
if your visiting las vegas  or living here dont miss out on this great tanning salon
well worth the 50 each
i keep my hair cut low on the sides and faded in the back and tray cuts it perfectly every time
here were my last three experiences checking out visit 1 clerk how are you
so happy i happened to find this place by chance
no greeting at all
update baja miguels is the black eye of this casino
i was given a massage here as a birthday treat and it was one of my favourite gifts
he recently started at this salon a few months back so the guy the other reviewers are referring to is not him
which includes haircut massage head shampoo on a massaging recliner chair hot towel treatment and back massage
ivy is extremely talented and her attention to detail is just wonderful
large kitchen rooms
even the massage chair was good and not like a torture chair
both tracy and christine are wonderful
i now have to pay for laser tattoo removal loose the hair on my brows and will still be scarred from her harsh and heavy hand
the employees were nice and at least 3 different girls asked if my friend or i needed any help
hmm maybe thats why the casino was always 34 empty
this place is incredible
definitely recommend to everyone
this was my first time getting bleached and i regret ever minute of it
i wouldnt suggest this salon to anyone
i cant explain it just book an appointment yourself to see what i mean
nice staff and service
sunchain is by far one of the best tanning salons all the girls that work there are very knowledgeable and you are in and out in 10 minutes
she told me she would do it
it is a very clean environment which i like
this place is pretty pricey for what you get
well at ad thats where
i would more appropriately label this a customer disservice
there wasnt one other person on the sheet that clarified express or spa
what a great idea and convenience to have a spa in an airport
it was my first time in the new building and i was impressed
the corners were missed and the application was so uneven
but she did allow me to stick my feet out of the blanket and she unplugged the table warmer to try to make me cooler which i appreciated
some positives are arkham comics who had a nice selection of books and toys in a well kept and clean space
then i tell her what the curly cut description from the website said
i appreciated the cleanliness privacy new magazines and fresh coffee
most definitely recommended
what a surprise it showed up magically
i could not imagine going anywhere else
my hands are constantly in and out of gloves taking samples opening envelopes while at research and then in the restaurant they are constantly being washed shining silverware changing tables etc
this was our 2nd time here but the 1st time we had joanna
it was uncomfortable but not unbearable
i got not 1 by 2 pieces done by rob  am very happy with both
i believe she did the original and followup treatments but had students get their hands in it
i will be back henna is the way to go
only go if its afterhours and an emergency
the stores layout is easy to navigate and the staff seems helpful
i found it really helped me take my mind off of the whole ordeal which probably helped to lessen the percieved pain
i was having my hair and makeup done for a formal event and it was a fantastic treat to get pampered for the afternoon
my sister and i stumbled onto this diamondintherough salon by accident and after 30 years living here having my nails done monthly i found this little gem
im so glad that i found them
i find that the discounts on all the items are very good usually at least around 30 and depending on the product could be even more deeply discounted
if you want a drive through spa service then this is the place
they do fantastic blowouts and are very courteous when trimming your hair
a significant amount of space has been designated sales space for the hilton grand vacations team
what is with the attitude
almost a full week later  no response
so i havent physically been to this location or any of the other deciem stores before
the facial was passable but i got a breakout the next day this could have been anything though
if youve ever had to search for a new salon you know its not easy
where time stands still explains the 3 wonderful days spent at the jw marriott scottsdale camelback inn resort and spa
to my pleasant surprise my haircut surpassed my expectations
the last year was the worst with my skin worsening with every attempt to fix it
marlene and kasey were absolutely brilliant and they worked wonders with our hair
she is simply the best thanks emme
couple other people i talked to at the salon loved her as well but she is not there any more  one day i just walked in no appointment and had ok experience then i heard i should always make appointment with james and i started doing so andrew was also doing my nails once both of them are great
they asked me to go and pay before she had even begun to finish
i will continue to go there and recommend her services to everybody
called to let them know and to get a redo
go check it out you wont be disappointed
rita is phenomenal and is super attentive to your needs
the main hotel and spa is a short distance from the villas and there are shuttles that run between both locations every half hour
the cashiers are super nice though
thats the treatment you get for generous tips
izuri is clean friendly professional and very reasonable
i still havent tried lasers here but i did a chemical peel and it was awesome
i dont write many reviews but when i do its because the place is that good
she is quick and efficient and the most personable
i really like this place
i highly recommend this salon
staff members are nice and pleasant nothing more you could say
we love this place and the staff
my aesthetician was very friendly and didnt make it weird or awkward at all
and once she felt i was in a good place she sent me off into the world armed with knowledge and a better understanding of what was wrong with me
im definitely returning
you are their number one priority and they arent  happy unless youre happy
you wont get board at all with doug
it is certainly not a pampering spa but i feel like this place is more authentic and less superficial then the caucasian spas that charges 30 for threading
i said theoretically because we ordered one housekeeping visit and no housekeeper showed up
ive been coming here on and off for about 3 years
first massage at a school have had professional  groupon michelle was amazing
i booked janny for onlocation bridal makeup for my 930 wedding
albanese salon de barbier is probably the best barber shop i have ever been trimmed at
i was guided to the massage room by one of the ladies who was at the front counter
she is honest professional and her space is conveniently located in old town scottsdale and has great easy parking
jon was fantastic
that team was great
i got the combination of the 30 on the feet and 30 on the body which they only massage your back body
i would highly highly recommend a haircut from ciara
great right no
would i recommend this place to a friend
i feel like she is an artist because they not only fit my frame they are beautifully natural
she also stated that she had been there for a long time and no matter what she would be there for a long time to come
i have been here multiple times and have seen various stylist as i have a random work schedule and dont get my hair done all the time
the staff at first spa could not have been any more welcoming engaging and pleasurable
he even has suggested to custom make my pink powder in the exact pink shade i want
was the friendliness put on until the tip came or is 20 no longer an acceptable tip to some people
i will go back
trust that youll be in good hands
i slept like a baby that night and my whole body could feel the difference the next day
once inside you enter a small waiting area and through a door to the right youll find lockers left is treatment rooms
i love this place
luisa is great and applies the right amount of pressure
i left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated and i will definitely be back
the room was missing slippers and bathrobe although this was clearly stated as being available to guests on their site on bookingscom
it isnt like regular hair salons all loud and so much going on
i would highly recommend sammy
im always satisfied with whoever does my nails
you can also find perfumes but i have never browsed in detail so i dont know if i would find paul smith and make up kits and tools  this is very useful
she did an awesome job on my cut and the color is fabulous
to be a member of gainey village health club is a lifestyle choice
you mean the same lack of consideration you have shown methen after that rude opening she says she had a family emergency and that she doesnt need clients like me
this is important to me because i hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me
i was really hesitant about going through another coloring full of chemicals
avoid this place at all costs
they do not pay attention to detail and miss the sides of your nails with the gel and arent as thorough with the pedicures
i rather pay the few extra bucks and get them done with her
she was very upset
everything is clean meaning there is no wax stuck to her the floor or the counters
she asked what i wanted done
a relaxing end to a long day  this clean and friendly establishment is a great place to go for your next massage
this is the place to go for all your grooming needs
i gave her a picture of what i wanted and she told me she couldnt do it
i will be looking for another salon before returning
i feel really relaxed tonight feels like she fixed all my knots
we start the process and he tosses a pillow on my lap
prices are fair and i would highly recommend and will use them again
before closing just in case i needed to make an appointment and the receptionist told me they were closing 1 hr
i went to studio raw and got my hair done by hannah
ill continue to use them and to refer my friends to them
i have also sent some friends to her that are blonde with bayalage and their hair looks great too
i highly recommend finding nicer place to go to who treat people like humans
im really not psyched about the totally unnecessary 200 hold they placed on my credit card
i wish theey looked better
i mean its included
i had a message all planned out in my head and when he answered i was a bit flabbergasted
you walk in and take your shoes off in the first part of the locker room and they have shoe lockers
my hair was swept to one side with twisted sections of hair and then nisha used 1inch iron to loosely curl the hair
holly was understanding and explained to me that because the skin was still healing it may be a little tender
went in for a quick lip wax
i felt really welcomed
its in the mall so oftentimes it is very busy but everyone has always acknowledged me right away even if it took a few minutes for them to be able to get to me
she then wasnt happy i didnt leave a tip
very happy with my pedi too i was relaxed and my feet never looked or felt better
i got acrylics with a gel polish and it came out beautiful
they have good food
it also took three hours for them to finish a basic manicure with shellac
there is no attempt to decorate or provide comfort
sometimes  theres a bit of a wait other times weve been lucky and theres not
i have waited over 30 minutes before i just wish that they were honest with the wait times
i was referred to the birthday suit
the place look very clean and was spacious served us with juice and tea
i enjoyed my pedicure but i wished i got a lil bit more massage lol my manicure turned out cute but i asked for my ring finger white with glitter on top guess she didnt understand that part so she only put glitter on it still cute tho
she is extremely knowledgable in all style types and has even made some great professional recommendations on what cut would look good with my hair type
owners are very friendly
the price is reaal good like i tried a lot of places and its not expensive at all for waxing
never finished my manicure
my nail tech was helen i believe that was her name and she did a really nice job
if you travel like me  you know the trials and disappointments you go through looking for a good barber
ill never return here
i desperately needed a massage
everyone was super friendly and had great customer service
per the owner deanna montrose the salon was not going to be able to honor a coupon i had purchased for a brazilian blowout
she knows her way around the human body
my mom  i both visited her for spurofthemoment eyebrow waxes and tints and our eyebrows have seriously never looked better
i guess you get what you pay for 20 pedicure but it still is my  what a disgrace to the vegas valley
ill keep looking for a regular nail salon in charlotte
as my tech was working on my toes she noticed the ingrown toenail from hell i took care of the previous night
also she is adorable and hilarious ask for esther you wont be disappointed
this was the best nail salon i have ever been to
the shop is in a strip mall and was a little bit challenging to find
overall it was a nice relaxing experience but not my favorite
price fair service excellent rooms need work bathrooms cool shower horrible bed and bedding very comfortable hvac blows on your face tv amazing pool the best part of the hotel awesome
went in for a haircut and had an employee boss
my issue isnt the price so much as the service
great massage chairs and great service
i am so lucky to have found katie
well i had to wait a few minutes while they finished my cousins cross
i am in the customer service industry and while it can be challenging todays experience was horrible and clearly they cared more about a cup of coffeesnack than getting more money and doing a full pedicure that clearly would have been no problem to do
mark is phenomenal
i didnt appreciate paying for mixing my color incorrectly
heather is such a nice person
place has shutdown
same size 16 fl oz
my husband gets his hair cut at this place religiously my a gentlemen named ray amazing
my first time that i came a few years ago i wasnt entirely pleased with my massage therapist
his wife did my feet and listened to what i wanted also
megan did a great job
they do the basic flash but all prefer to do custom work to showcase the artistic skill and to also give the consumer that personal flavor
been there 3 times
i scheduled my next facial for the following month which i am so excited for
marilo is amazing
i booked an appointment easily so that was a plus
service is extremely friendly and i would definitely recommend checking this place out before your next vacation
kim rienzi rn is unbelievable with botox and fillers she has an artists eye and truly cares about each patient
we had an instant connection
i got it colored and highlighted recently by her she relocated to here and yes i followed her
this hotel is non smoking and non gaming
ganbanyoku beds 6 heated beds
i wouldve have hoped the quality of the nails and massage were a little better
amanda did a great job on my brows
i think all the people there are fine but i really like sally
i liked the hotel so much i rather stay here than on the strip
the place was clean the staff friendly and it was definitely quiet and relaxing
theres a pool and thats that
so if this time i gave up again and i thought i dont bother writing about them as kim was even shouting at me last sunday only 4 days ago that they were busy and i could go back another time
pure  simple customize each facial ive had and provide an analysis of my skin post treatment
when i asked about this evidence they said they had photos of cigarette butts on our porch
i wouldve given it four stars but im a stickler for aesthetics
the tattoos on each of us took about 15 minutes at most we had already paid the 100 each for the deposit which is the rate for 1 hour and were charged an additional 100
i was used to san francisco pricing so i ended up buying two for less than what one would have cost me in the bay area
i had michele v as my stylist and could not have been happier
we will both ask for rebecca the next time we are in vegas and encouraged others to do so as well
hugo karen emmanuel and the entire crew are so lovely to work with
its just unfortunate that the facilities seem to be suffering from age and a poor environment choice
their nail techs are incredible and professional and so quick
she knew exactly what i wanted and made it happen
do your best to run up that thing and feel like a ninja
the salt cave itself was very cool
i bought an awesome tanning lotion and signed up for a 3 month packageafter my second visit i definitely noticed color
i left happy and baby smooth with a big smile on my face
hes patient and works with you on ideas you have
her prices are reasonable and she does a great job
i loved that she incorporated hot stones into the massage
i did not feel that my business was needed or appreciated on any of my visits
lets just say this is a lesson learned
so i was in a pinch and needed a hair cut asap
i highly recommend joya spa
yes i said it a brazilian wax that is gentle
she did an amazing job on my gel manicure
she received this well and the proof will come at the next appointment so well see
cannot recommend her enough
booking was easy we walked into the spa that day and i was able to get an appointment for just a couple of hours later
the next thing i knew i was sound asleep and he told me to go ahead and turnover
she also gave me some insightful advice on alleviating a frizzy phase that my hair always goes through when it air dries and offered to try to get a product that is hard to find in stores so that shed have it for me the next time i came in
she literally complained the entire time while cutting two of my toes and letting them just bleed in the water and painting my nails like a toddler
i waited an hour and half
they do great work
id be willing to pay the extra 5 current barber charges less to come back here
i had a good experience at fresh cuts
very professional and pleasant
and last they did
and two small bottles of water with the biltmore name in our room are 550 each
i met with nicole and we went over some ideas for my piece
i went back to get them removed the next day
my massage therapist was very good  he had a japanese name
ask for gina ginos daughter
the whole situation was handled very poorly and it shows how unprofessional the business is
she is professionaly easy to talk to
poor polish job and very thick
ive learned from bad experiences in the past to discuss price before hand
omg best massage ever
and because im not crazy about having my face groomed right out in the middle of a major mall plaza
i love it
need  a nice inexpensive place to stay  yes i would stay here
she assessed the situation  situation was  i just 2 weeks ago paid for a full set before going to hawaii and showed up at mustang lashes w 45 lashes per eye
water temperature is just like returning to the womb im guessing
i wanted to pay 1920 in cash thanks to some luck at the tables and put the rest on my amex
if youre on a business or relaxing trip and even remotely plan of having any quiet time at all avoid
tracy did a great job on my manicure and nail art
learn to listen and make your client t happy dont tell them your only cutting off an inch and half and then end up chopping off all their hair seriously if this wasnt a groupon i would have run out without paying
jack was an awesome barber and the shave is amazing and close
its nice to be recognized in stead of just another head of hair
some people are insecure about taking their clothes off in front of a random person however she was very professional and made me feel extremely comfortable while doing the tan
i love mosaic salons products and clothes
they are nice people though alot nicer than other salons ive been to
i would not recommend this business to anyone unless you want to pay for someone to yell at you or make you feel stupid
my girl had no idea how to rip off the wax strips and mutilated my arm until someone else literally came in and finished it for her
she is sooo  catering to you and pays attention to detail
currently he rents his space at salon 7 topher works on prominent sets in the hollywood ca market but visits the valley of the sun monthly to keep his local clients in good shape
i have an after picture and its disturbing
the property is in great shape and just pick which pool you want to hang out at
super accommodating and friendly
i even asked for a pink nailbed color that was darker than what i thought and she scraped it off and redid it for me without being upset at all
they are accommodating to my busy and always changing schedule and almost always have something available within a couple days
first of all we went to the wrong entrance where we waited behind people taking forever to make an appointment at the spa for the next day
the trainers are amazing specifically ryan h brandon b and nicholas
there are nice pedi chairs and bowls
she listens and takes her time
not only that but she was told that they have been booked for these deals for more than 2 months
i can overlook that the color i selected was all out and there was not the same replacement
truly an exceptional waxer
he is very funny and gives the best pedicure
i argued with him to get my money and he told me how there is no refund
i have very thick curly hair so a cut and color takes about four hours
when i first looked at it after she was finished  i was amazed
nice clean place with lots of chairs and nice people
after sitting under the dryer i walked out trying to hold back the tears
she put 3 coats on all my nails and then put oil on my hands
i will definitely recommend dollheads and nicole
the place would have gotten a 4 but some kinks in my experience i had to reflect it in the rating
christian has now cut me up a few times and has always been on point
natalie owns and i cant wait to go back and do it all over again
i hope everyone enjoyed themselves
the two ladies at the counter were chatting with each other not busy so why was i on hold
athena did my blowout and she was amazing
amina was refreshing
no refreshing mask and no towel wrap
this time i was told that a party came in 20 minutes late so everyone was running behind
it was amazing followed up by a facial by irene
discovered this oldest barber shop near asu arizona state university in tempe az from one of the local event
the products smelled and felt fantastic
the last few times ive gone there has been a bit of a wait but if you have an appointment its smooth sailing
they also offer botox juviderm and other facial injectables
i wouldnt recommend this salon to my worse enemy
i have never been downgraded in my entire travel history
not chipping straight peeling off
they were amazing
as i moved to toronto just a few months ago i was on the search for a new hair salon i had been going to the same salon in whitby for almost 10 years
on a family vacation on a whim i went to a tattoo artist not allowing enough time to get a proper job
not great service
my hair was a mess to say the least but i brought a picture and she nailed it
i will start by saying the staff is pretty friendly
anyway something happened to her but i dont know what it is was
request for mayu  she did a really good job at cutting my hair and giving me what i wanted with the very few pictures i gave her
my second problem with this place was when i signed up they talked about how it would never be a problem to cancel if i moved out of the area big big lie
alycia is the best
my massage therapist even did some eucalyptus aromatherapy as my nose gets stuffy from lying face down that long
my regular physician did not know how to treat my condition and recommended another dermatologist
i was looking for some one that could do a good job on both color and cut and ran into a lady whos hair looked amazing so i had to ask who does her hair she said terry
i definitely got a deal
had a shellac manicure and a regular polish pedicure
my hair and eye brows have never looked better
however even being tan ive had fantastic results
not sure i do love coming here for eyelash extensions
the hours could have changed or maybe the staff decided to close early on sunday
absolutely everything youve ever wanted in a nail salon
my back and arms felt great considering i didnt know how sore i was until he was done
the spas are nice especially the one outside in the winter is pretty awesome me and my girlfriend went there to heat things up i recommended well for couples come and enjoy wont regret it
have been going here since they opened and have gotten nothing but perfect haircuts
im so thankful because i moved from california and i couldnt find a hair stylistim very picky about color and being a blonde its hard to find the right stylist
they refuse to pluck it they just tell you this pack has less hair
my masseuse was jeff
the shop has also upgraded its chairs and lobby from when i first came in
also at my 2nd appointment i told her where additional attention was needed and she hit the area almost perfectly  i saw very little additional growth in that area
she was so sweet and attentive to detail
the staff is so friendly and welcoming youll never leave here disappointed
got some wine and cheese and crackers while having my pedi done which was lovely
i stood there looking at each individual one for over 20 minutes while hearing her sigh behind the register
as for the actual store it feels a little chaotic in there and the bathroom was a little dirty
i dont get my nails done often but i am definitely a little more weary now
plus it was really quick
everyone towel handeroutters life guards security etc
this was my first time having my lashes done i love them
and this is the first place that ive been to that i love how clean they are and how kind they are and it doesnt hurt that we speak the same language  farida is one of the kindest most sweetest people ive met ive gone to so many places in the mall to get my eyebrows done and i go to her world religiously i live on the other side of town but its worth it to drive out just to come see her
it was a very unfamiliar and uncomfortable feeling almost like the juvederm had been diluted with something else  so uncomfortable that it immediately alarmed me and i pulled back from him
i called and booked a fill
also i dont think i would have felt comfortable paying their prices if not for the special we took advantage of
i waited about three minutes
no one told me there was a wait nor did they check up on or apologize for waiting
the customer service is also really great and theyre very attentive to your needs
it took awhile for him to finish because during his process the lady that helped him did something that made his cuticles bleed on two fingers
and said it would be no problem and they could have it ready in 10 minutes
she has been doing my hair for over 2 years now
i am in love with my nails and will definitely be coming back and recommending anyone in need of a good nail place
i was a member for a year twice a month and i always had a good experience except for 2 times
its pretty sad when you look better with 6 months of overgrowth and split ends than an hour after the chair
liane does my fill pedi and eyebrow wax
ive gone to a couple other places to get my brazilian to test out the waters but most of them was actually pretty painful compared to the wax they use here
this location is super clean compared to the camelback store and the employees seem friendly and the usually willing to help
to start off the overall customer service at roosters has always been fantastic
i brought her birth  certificate just in case and of course my id i guess what i was really looking forward to  was having my daughters two ears pierced  at the same time
first and last time here
salon ro5 is a great hair styling business
i was blown away  i said excuse me
i got a good massage here for a good price
shane and his staff are professional from the first phone call all the way through the piercing process
id say must try before you die
we talked about my job and what i do on a regular and choose acrylics with gel polish
gym and spa
plus its 247 baby
it was the worst style i ever had
you really need to pay attention to the signs
the massage was worth every penny and more
absolutely loved my first appointment
well worth it
this place was awesome
i seriously wish i could fine a place in california that does a brazilian bikini wax as good as the birthday suit in las vegas but cant so far
i did not originally choose esthetic advisor but only because of availability and timing of my needs
although i got my makeup done with little to no interruptions maria did let me know that if a customer came in to shop she would have to stop and help them
i was so comfortable nay elated
she knows exactly what looks good on me and has a great sense of style
their makeup was cohesive to my own makeup and the photos looked fabulous
will be booking again
the other place totally messed up my nails and there was no way i was going to go back there
the sandwiches were dry and basically not eatable
unfortunately i paid i left and this will be the last time
if you are willing to pay the price then go for it and treat yourself to a manipedi
i enjoyed my facial and would come back again
i recently had hair extensions put in and im so happy
great service and great nails
the shop is more expensive but walking away with something you love is well worth it
i always have shellac done on my nails and i find holly or tina to be the most detailed when doing my nails
ashley was amazing
she looked hella pleased that she finished in minutes possibly world record for her i said youre fast
easy access to bellagio aria and 5 min walk to cosmo
amelia was a complete delight
super happy this is the only nail shop i go to
to top it off she was from minnesota also    i will be returning and will be having my family see her too
the owners are great and definitely know what they are doing and vanessa does a spectacular job on my nails every time
i sat in the lobby for 5 ish minutes before someone came out and she rudely told me to sit here
i did not get gel it was regular polish
im paying 25 a month for unlimited tanning which includes the standup booth
i hope more people come and keep this place is business
not sure why this place has bad reviews
they take pride in their work and boy does it work
but i barely got my nails done on dec 31st and two nails broke already with little to no force
had my first henna tattoo today and lia at fashion square is awesome
professional knowledgeable and great at what they do
you can barely walk in the place for all the chairs everywhere
compared to what ive seen even locally her work is impressive
gave me an affordable price and really went the extra mile to give me amazing hair
ill never go to a regular salon again
shes had a lot of pregnant clients so shes fantastic at it
the aesthetic and feel of the shop is also amazing
how can a nail place not have driers
definitely check out this awesome nail salon in verona
i was apprehensive about finding a new salon
getting a tattoo well its intimate
walked in without an appointment a couple weeks ago after reading a good review
i took my own before  after photos  am embarrassed about the before  astonished with the after
oksana is great and always takes her time to do a thorough and good job and is careful with the painful areas
she slapped the glue on and then started putting the lashes so fast
quite possibly the nastiest people i have ever met anywhere
im blonde and its been hard to find someone to get the color just right
she said there is no guarantee on how long the polish last and if i want it to last longer for 1500 they can repaint with gel polish
the lady working was nice and asked me what brought me to the store and i informed her that i usually go to the one by my house but the last time i went i started having pimples on top of my eyebrows
when that grateful serene sadness hits you in the chest remember my review and ill send you my email address to paypal me your lost bet
thanks snapdragon salon
maybe to a fault
i recommend this salon for a quick trim and great conversation
what a waste of 200 and a few hours
how anyone says this to a child is beyond me
she always made sure i was comfortable with the temperautre of the water and even when she brushed my hair
she informed me of any specials and gave me a chance to look over their prices
i always love a deal but when the fine print reads like the tax act it kinda takes away from the spa feeling
she also didnt bring me the water she offered
i checked reviews on yelp and went to a couple of shops and ended up at precious slut
been here twice first haircut was kind of blah nothing to run home about but they did take me as a walk in right away which is great
ask for diana
what a nice savings
i had the idea for this coverup but nicole brought it to life
i went to nail spa just because it is close to where i live
needless to say it was hard to tell on our own
he also took his time and i didnt feel like i was being rushed out the door
i was not satisfied and upset by one of the stylist s performance choose the stylist carefully
even though it was my first time i did not feel awkward or uncomfortable at any point
it was three of us and they accommodated us so they we all are in the same room
wes is the owner and he is very friendly and personable
thank you so much rick and staff for such a memorable and wonderful afternoon
they are prompt and were ready
it looked like the nails had grown out a week
i just take my kids to a kids place in town now
now i truly can give it a great rating
for years and years he has taken care of me with his consistent immaculate fades
in fact ive been back a few times since for manicures and pedicures
they also sell layrite pomade which are hard to find here in toronto
brian is amazing
shes super personable and sweet and always does an awesome job with my brows
she filedbuzzed my nails to death
the beauticians are friendly and the salon is pretty tasteful etc but i think the price is whats keeping the fourth star off for me
the basic pedicure comes with a foot and leg massage and you can add extras based on other things you need like salt scrub or paraffin wax
the girl was very brash and not very friendly at all
my friend was getting a little star on her foot one of the points were crooked the tattoo artist got all pissy when she said she wanted it straight and compared the star to the mona lisa saying its art the mona lisa isnt perfect either
i havent gotten tattoo in a while so i was really nervous about getting a tattoo and finding someone that could execute what i wanted
lots of colorful nail polish
do not go to allure  i went for a chemical peel and my skin was literally burned
summers around the corner ladies 65 for brazilian
she was very fast
she started vigorously buffing the polish down so violently that she cut my finger
pool was great
so i went back and i got another gel manicure
tvs all over to keep you entertained if you have a boring barber which i highly doubt
tomorrow im bringing my mother whom im sure will love it as well especially because they serve sangria and wine
anyway to make my long story short i gave up on making an appointment for a brow wax
this was my first time in a salon in usa and powered with mixed reviews from yelp and a coupon from livingsocial i dared to take the risk of handing over my hair to a to be professional stylist
the nail tech used the wrong product on my nails
i am so glad i did
she was my stylist elsewhere  i moved to phoenix for a year
my first time i called and they suggested dates and times around the information i provided
their environments include the usual steam rooms whirl pools and saunas but also an herbal room an ice room an underwater room tropical thunderstorm showers etc some of which are singlesex some coed
i went with the classic since it wasnt that much more and wanted to be pampered
her hands were gentle yet firm
i dont understand if i was complaining of eye irritation why she would not choose to use this for the next application
my stylist meemee really took her time to listen to exactly what i wanted and gave me a cut that made me feel like a whole new person
i lovvvveeeeee coming here everyone is very nice helpful and sweet u get free bolttle water with a smile lol and they wax eyebrows here too this place is a must come ladys
my pedicures last for a long time easily a month and 30 is all it costs for a pedicure including tip
the sandwich was good but not the best ive ever had
i received a text confirming the appointment and appeared at the salon a few minutes prior to the appointment time
i  dont often write reviews because i feel that good customer service is a necessity for every business and i rarely feel that someone has gone above and beyond that to make sure im happy
i went in with a photo and terry gave me exactly the cut that i wanted
you basically do not have to leave the hotel
good old school shops are hard to find i thought
after several years of living on a tight budget while going back to school which unfortunately included budget haircuts walking into model citizen was a breath of fresh air
the price was unreasonable for ending up with a crooked right index finger
i had been going to random nail shops around vegas for about 8 months before i stumbled on this nail place
even though this is the closest nail salon to my house i will go to my favorite island nail salon on mcqueen and elliot or try the one across cooper for my first time
i just got a pedicure done here today
lettie is just wonderful
coming on wednesdays saved me about 15 per appointment
i was given a complementary neck and should massage by his assistant
the massage alone was very good and targeted the spots i requested she target
this is my third time came here for massage
maybe i had a miscommunication with my stylist the first time i visited her
i have used this business for the last 3 months and will continue to
according to her i had a few tight muscles here and there and thanks to a few of her tips im doing alot better
i am definitely blown away by my experience
i am losing my hair on the top of my head  like a lot of other guys
he took his time to share his ideas as well as mine as both him an i collaborated on a beautiful piece of art for an existing messed up tattoo
bowl liners autoclave for tools and new files
i usually get swedish or deep tissue
i dont recommend
lol id be doing the drive of walkin shame all the way back to henderson
even worse she didnt even massage my feet
its sad that one person can ruin a good place that easily
lynn did a great job on my nails
i am a longtime eyelash strip wearer and this was my first experience with individual eyelash extensions
i went during a groupon deal so it worked out to be about 20yoga class or rock bathing session
really fantastic experience and gorgeous atmosphere
stephen and his family are always friendly but above all its clean
instantly this lady bursted out a very huge dissatisfactoryangry sigh and facial expression in front of my bff and said she has to check
i normally go to places for my eyebrows to get waxed but ive heard threading was more precise and lasted longer so i decided to go for it
they are a little pricier than most of the places we visit but for once my girls arent complaining so i guess you truly get what you pay for
the girls are always quick to greet us
megan is amazing
i asked to leave a message for him to call me and was told and i quote you know he has a full time job right
she seems to know what shes doing until she gets off track  but thats like me at home depot so all good and aside from the perpetual checkout line which i see others have posted about the experience is pretty painless
the staff were all very nice and courteous
after being ignored for 45 minutes i decided to call capri nails and ask what their wait time would be
i went there for the first time last week largely because of the price stated on their website
its always nerve racking going to a new salon and stylist
went to rio nails to have a pedicure and was very impressed
all the staff is super kind and listen to what you have to say theyve always been able to accommodate me even when theyre super busy
the staff are extremely friendly and helpful
if you are reading this review best advice is do not settle for bad customer service and give credit to those that do an exceptional job
julie did an awesome job
rarely are heavily drugged people called rude so many times because they are not capable of being coherent enough to be rudesuch a poor attempt at your own defense
would give no stars if an option
i work in the industry so i always tip very well but clearly susie would prefer a low commission compared to a nice tip
bro this place is trash
cold water for her rush job  a massage on her legs that was 30 seconds
never seen her before and i was scared less that a stranger may eff up one of the most visible body parts that can be waxed
all 3 are located in the forum shops at caesars palace
5 reasons float toronto deserves 5 stars  floating is amazing
the overall design and warmth of the hotel is on point with anything ive experience and i really would like to return
3 love the vending machines on the floor accepts credit cards without fees
michelle benjaminremember that name write it down if you have to
this place is great
he refused to cut my hair the way i wanted
why it didnt get a 5 star from me 1 i found 2 strands of hair
korean spas are wonderful inexpensive comparatively and social
i recently found this fantastic lady marci her hair colouring experience is great and hair cuts thank you
i did eyebrows one time and i did like them
her attention to detail and the individuals unique needs and her ability to keep up with new trends and cutting techniques
i thought it was for feet only but it was pretty much fullbody
im not  sure what she means by aka
i first went to larry arnolds after multiple surgeries as an result of the devastating aftereffects of chemo
mike did a unbelievable job
she used no coolantlotion after the wax and was clearly not into doing it
all in all 50 minutes for a regular manicure is unheard of
we got a pretty good deal to stay in a 800 sq feet room so we went for it   we wanted something nice for our anniversary so we were willing to spend a tad more money the room was really nice it was clean the shades were all automatic we had a 270 degree view of the outside we didnt want to valet so we parked at aria and walked over they also have a tram that stops in ariamonte carlo ariacrystals and bellagiovdara i thought that was cool there is no smoking in the room and there is no gambling either upon entering there is a very strong perfume smell our fridge had a ice maker so we didnt need to go out to get ice which i thought was really great we had 2 sinks and the bathtub was big enough for 2 people to fit now for the bad our room wasnt cleaned no one came until around 4 pm to ask
if you want the best hair colorist ever go to sam
well  i paid for a service that i didnt get you do owe me
ymmv but i would carefully consider giving this company your business
definitely going back
i think my feet ended up with the least amount of attention
a little far from the strip but at a good price
the salon is pretty run down and their selection of nail polishes is very limited
the first thing she says is so you wanna reschedule
this store is great
the only reason im giving a four star is because he seemed to be bugged with me every time i asked him a question
she better not be too big of a makeup artist by the time my wedding rolls around
first impressions the spa is clean organized and the staff are very friendly
she asked me what i thought of it
april listens to what the client wants and offers amazing suggestions
cynthia does a fantastic facial
i even got two flowers from one of her flash sheets tattooed on my back
the prices are very reasonable for the services provided
i knew i was going to be a hardsale though because as i said i liked my previous salon a lot
if youre a girl and wear makeup daily think about the build up on your face that not all cleansers can get
she didnt seem to know which one that was
the owners did nothing
i wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing a groupon for them
felt rushed the entire time for a manipedi that was booked a few days before
this place is aptly named
bernardo is my guy hes super friendly and very good at what he does
finally after several attempts and much patience on my part my services were completed
overall layout the crsc is big and i didnt even know how big until i got lost and ended up on the mens side
the salon staff agreed then he ran up to my sister snatched her purse and took off
samantha is a professional hairstylist who really takes her time to consult with you on what youre looking to get done
but what i respect and return for is the consistent quality of work   the nail techs can execute a preferred style reliably each visit without much micromanagement
first of all the spa was a little difficult to find
garrett is a great stylist i have been to him several times for beautiful foil highlights and on my last visit he gave me a long bob cut
got something small for 80
the only concern i had was that i did not see their licenses or certifications anywhere in the building
i will not be back because i have experienced much better service and at a better price
spent memorial weekend at the resort and really enjoyed our staycation
this was visit and disaster part 1 on the 2nd visit for a gel refill which was on the price and menu board but apparently wasnt offered
ive spent about 1000 in gaming spa service incidentals and dining here in 2 days which you would think would count for something
we were looking for a foundation and didnt know the product number so we asked her to look up previous purchases but she said no we can do that on our own
we will definitely return
however her make up hygiene standards are so problematic that i had to give her 1 star
i did not expect the construction and wasnt told on the phone when i was booking an appointment there
i got a manicure and pedicure from kristine and a massage from jennifer
i was very excited about getting first my  facial in ages
im so addicted to this heavenly sweet scent
ive actually never seen a customer walk out of there with any complaints before
my gel nails look great the price was better than other places ive been to in summerlin
the property is amazing and meticulously maintained
anyway needless to say i wont be back again
absolutely love this place
shes so talented and i really enjoyed talking to her
for me it cost 20 and for my wife 30
massage was great price was great service was great
im very picky about who i let colorcut my hair but when i find someone i trusti let himher take charge
her her was completely damaged and left with full healthy looking hair
the salon is clean and tucked away
i stopped in this afternoon
there was also a steam room and a dry sauna room to use
wont break the bank
i was overall happy with the entire treatment
they rushed my friends pedicure and she was bleeding so much
as a business owner myself i know all too well that this is the case
the lady that helped me completely rushed through not only the pedicure but when it came time for the manicure i got a full set she rushed through so fast that i had noticeable lumps
i am so happy that i took a chance and walked into divas today
from what i remember of the other places fuchsias prices were much better and the quality was better as well
first off the price of a pedicure is double what youd pay at a cheap salon so if youre really wanting a budget pedicure this is not it
especially since its in the same parking lot as tjmaxx
i was also shocked the 20  tip was already added to my bill
the service was very good and atmosphere was relaxing
the regular price of the lunch buffet is 895
not top notch service like i would expect from a sephora
its a lettuce wrap fried chicken skewers these are perfectly cooked tenders w a nice sweet n spicy sauce
my friend recommended me to him and she still gets her hair cut here whenever shes visiting from ny too
i usually ask for cherry jennifer or tiffany they have all done wonderful gel manicures
were visiting from ny and wanted to try a spa here in scottsdale
the atmosphere of the salon in general is really friendly relaxing and stylish
after i was taken in a back room i was left waiting in the room with numbing cream on my face for 62 minutes
but they always lie to you when it comes to wait time to get you to stay
ask for the herbal pedicure its an upgrade with an extensive foot massage
they also have the plastic liner for the pedicure chairs very clean
during my visit i told loretta and jonnel that i was feeling guilty for over indulging thanksgiving and they both stopped me in my tracks and told me that it was a holiday and it was ok to indulge
she does an impeccable job
if i were just reviewing ryan and my hair cut id give 5 stars
when i went about 2 weeks before halloween it wasnt so bad but business was still fairly brisk
she knows her stuff so ive gotten wonderful tips and advice from her about skincare and overall health
tattoo took four sessions and i tipped well so it wound up costing a little more than i anticipated
today assistant store manager juliana was preoccupied with leaving the store at noon rather than providing excellent customer service
my gf had the same issues with the dude
dr sohn did a great job and he was very professional
i never write negative reviews but this needs to be addressed
she watched the tv the whole time while 12 paying attention to giving me the pedicure
second and third place  hamam and shizen in the pantages
the massage chairs work but thats about as high end as you are going to getno plates of cheese and grapes or glasses of wine
only downside price
im updating a five star with another five star bc i want to make sure my stylist nadine gets a shout out
she scrubbed my naked body down with scrub and added cold lotion
anybody looking for a great tattoo experience must get to this place
orsi is also excellent for facials
sarah gave me a wonderful massage that i needed very badly
would have preferred to give zero stars
daniel hooked me up with some last minute xmas nails when i came in town
we went in as a group of four on fathers day
little conversation in english of course and im asian
its thick and coarse and is wavy and just all over the place
location was a little difficult to find when i walked in i was pleasantly greeted by kathy
hotel staff at front desk are friendly
he listens and asks my opinion as he goes along
my friends and i meet here to catch up and they accommodate our request to sit together without a problem
i guess this is new owners  and she didnt know what i was talking about
they are very detail oriented and definitely took their time to make sure my nails are well taken care of
instead its filled with the employees drawings and paintings so i immediately saw that as a good sign
maybe they do a good job with regular manispedis but their shellac mani was subpar
i know its my fault ultimately i was just really excited to get it done
i had toner done and id recommend her
easy to find products
thank you jhonathan for giving me my confidence back the great experience i had and exceeding my expectations i am so glad to call you my stylist
friendly clean and convenient
i suffer from migraines and often have something called in from my specialist in greensboro as a rescue
lol prices are comparable to other shops in the area so what separates them are the people
i believe a customer would receive better hospitality and an overall more enjoyable experience at a massage school for an even better price
but good lord this place really got to me
byop bring your own polish  other then that good customer service  and skills
she managed to salvage my hair style and make it something lovely
ive been getting my hair cut here for about 10 years
everyone is really friendly and they stick to their appointment times
simply the best most natural spray tan you can get
ive been tanning here for a couple months
my sons first hair cut
but trust me if youre looking to get a tattoo check out divinity
i cannot believe that okra is turning a blind eye to this predator
went for a blow out the lady told me its gonna be 45
ive been a client for 25 years now and would never think about going elsewhere
each chair has their own tv and comfortable atmosphere
what a treat of relaxation
great business and im glad to see that they are getting the reviews they deserve here
i had my second massage by ariana today  once again  a great massage
this hotel is in torontos entertainment district  so it is within walking distance of many restaurants
i wanted a gel manicure and the color swatches were in terrible shape  dirty and broken
she really put me at ease and assured me that there would be no head shaving and unnatural hair color involved
diarra is amazing
the receptionists for the massage services seem professional and competent
who doesnt love to save a little cash
we did a 30mins massage manicure and a mini facial spa sensation package
great customer service and i got right in
i had a color and cut and last time i had color and highlights
thank you relax nail and spa for upsetting me or i would not have found leslies
i was nervous about trying to find someone out here to do my hair
the new location is beautiful
she then stated that they could stick around and maybe they would be able to give the boys haircuts
she asked me if i would come in to have it fixed and i said no
if youre looking for upscale with personable talented stylists minus attitude this is it
when i walked in there i was greeted and taken in right away without any wait
i have been in three times and every time i am charged a different price
i was helped by katy every step of the way and she was great
its ok so i decided to try out a new hair salon which was a bad idea  anyways i first find out about this salon on yelp because of its high rating
what a marvel
and i have a bergamot natural perfume she blended for me that is one of the most delicious things youll ever smell and never gives anyone a headache
long story short terrible customer service terrible response time to complaint
employees are funny and make you feel welcomed these guys know what they are doing best haircut place ive been too
love this place
her location is clean and convenient and her bubbly personality makes each visit all the more enjoyable
i have been to other salons in the city and my nails have lasted 4 weeks
3 during the cut the stylist here told me my hair was too hard to cut with scissors because its too short
its been about a week now and this situation was just horrific
got an amazing tattoo from zach
i was so happy that she appeared at the time she did
wish he had more people person customer service skills was a little abrupt but at the end of the day the product is what matter
her wall of fame is proof of her talents
overall great guy and always wants the best for his customers
the day of my surgery the anesthesiologist dr crowley and the nurse heidi were so sweet and caring and i knew i was in great hands
attached is a picture of my hair before the stylist touched it 2nd photo is after stylist at this salon ruined it 3rd photo is my hair fixed by another stylist at another salon
i have scheduled several consultations around the city based on word of mouth and reviews online
the staff is supper friendly well knowledgeable highly trained and offer you a nice selection of natural and organic products for treating your scalp and hair to shaving soaps to great brushes for shaving and for your hair
i usually use juice beauty and she proceeded to tell me that juice beauty is no good and to switch to pur
she wasnt worth being yelled at  and plus i thought i would just review my bad experience
she also said that it takes a couple return visits to rehab my brows from waxing since my previous lady trimmed my hairs too short
rates are good plus they offer a 20 discount for first time customers
see and experience for yourself what her salon has to offer
typically stay on or close to the strip but a client meeting in summerlin lead me to select this marriott
my hair looks as good after 4 weeks as it did the day i got it cut which is something ive never experienced
i got a awful manicure today and i complained about it i got the gel manicure and they tried fixing it by refiling my nails really
huge thing for me
also the time before the licked finger incident i went for a manicure and my cuticles peeled back for 2 weeks
this is a very upscale place great service most every one was cordial and polite
all are top notch
im a california native and when i moved to vegas i was in the hunt for a new esthetician
i highly recommend joanna
the only downside if there is one is that there are limited massage hours but thats not enough to make me complain
will be back in 2 weeks for my followup  cant wait
she does an excellent job at listening to what i want
we ordered an appetizer that came out after our dry tasteless burgers and that was only because we reminded the server valeria that we ordered an app to begin with
by the way they do offer shellac at this location as well as waxing services
i saw a deal on yelp and decided to try it 75 worth of service for 50 but what i wanted ended up with was a lot more expensive which is why i gave the 4 star if i could afford that all the time i would go back because i really liked my hairstylist and the outcome
handled my hair roughly and even poked me in the eye at one point
sure it costs a tad more but the haircut is better quality
im so glad i did because im so satisfied with my nails
they pulled my hand hard and i told them not too touch me and they pulled it harder  bullshit
which was so disrespectful
i get a lot of compliments on my nails
i am so grateful for this place and will continue to recommend it to anyone who needs chiropractic care
however i decided to give them a try as i did not want to allow one employee to ruin it from the business
prior to her coming to my hotel
all the ladies were extremely helpful and professional
ive been to many professional hair salons and pay 35 for a wash cut and blow dry so when i paid the same amount for a trim with no wash or products or styling i was a bit shocked
he was encouraged  by the many compliments he has received and now the most expensive has magically  morphed into the best haircut of his life
they wanted to charge extra on the groupon they had
baffled i call the main line
she took her time making sure she had the right color mixed for my hair
i guess that what you get when you find a place in groupon its a gamble although i didnt pay groupon i was lead to believe to come with the idea that ill pay groupon price abut charged me full price when all done rip off
then i heard the receptionist shout from the sidewalk what are you doing
tee at polished is absolutely amazing
never have i bleed from her doing my nails always friendly  we talk the entire time
everything was clean sterile
the people arent always the friendliest but thats more culture than customer service
theyre all so nice and offer you drinks a salon
best gel design in town
i feel so relieved to finally find someone in pho enix who really listens and delivers on their clients request
david is my guy
i didnt take advantage of it but the room has an electric stove microwave mini fridge dishes pans and silverware to cook
i got a very good cut and the colour was just what i wanted
i originally got a full gel set from rachel and she did such a great job ive gone back to her since
she also did two passes for cuticle removal which was awesome
be prepared to tip 20 or better
suggest making an appointment and confirming it tho
the guys at the front desk were amazing
tried going to the new location in jcpenney  at pv mall but it was so small and literally didnt have any of the same brands that this location has it was a total waste of time and i will be taking my business exclusively to this location plus everyone who works here is really awesome and knowledgeable about all the products
i love the reduced packaging high quality allnatural products and the smells
at perfect 10 nails i was welcomed in i had set an appointment the morning of to ensure that i wasnt any of the walk in customers they might not get to until later and i told her my problems with the nails done before and she realized that they were badly done as well
so excited that they are opening 2 more locations one which is very close to my house
i was a little concerned at first but i had promised my daughter she could get her hair cut so we decided to take a chance
this was after they called less than 24 hours before my scheduled appt
the price is so worth every penny
sadly the massage was actually decent but i would never return or recommend due to the customer service
first he told me nobody ever said it was 5 and then sorry
one nice thing about them is that theyre open on sundays
if you seriously have knots and often complain of having tense shoulders or muscles everywhere do yourself a favor and give rex and sunny a call and let them work their magic on you
i cant believe i paid extra for it
i will tell all my friends this is by far the best nail spa in phoenix
its a shame that its come to this
we took our 18 month old son in for his very first hair cut and had the best experience with cool cuts
i do it better myself
i hope i get back to phoenix just to stay here again
was he paying attention
best experience i have ever had with a dr  wonderful staff
absolutely loved this salon
open everyday and everyone always nice prices are great
and another call maybe a month go asking if i would like to book a massage
id say that was quite the upgrade as comped rooms sometimes tend to be the cheaper standard ones
i went in to have a spot removed on my head it wasnt cancer but he still wanted to remove it and im ok with that but after he removed it he started showing me pics of old men with blotches all over and said thats what you will look like when you get older my nose is red and he said it was from drinking i drink but not that much landow said i was going to look like ex mayor oscar goodman and that there is nothing i can do to stop it
the guy who answered the phone is new and in training and shouldnt have quoted me a price
well today i went here for the first time based on everyones yelp reviews
i have posted pics of the damaged fingers
i called a couple of hours before coming in to make an appointment
cant beat that
ive since moved to buckeye but still work close by
on a recommendation from a trusted friend i contacted blanca
you should definitely do yourself a favor and make it yours too
and my celebrity crush
i havent had hair this bad since my adolescent hair experiments
i was told no problem go ahead and bring her in
the pool area is nice and inviting a hot tub would be nice to have
hes also better at picking out a new hairstyle for me than i am
i wish i remembered her name because she was incredibly personable
youre fine no cancer
i love him i will come back to him if i need another trimming
really family like atmosphere with all the girls makes things that much more relaxing
flat screen tv refrigerator electric two stove top microwave cookware dishes cups silverware too
just moved to the area and popped in so glad i did
by the time i met trina it was 5weeks since i had done my nails as i waited for them to grow out
i highly recommend this place if you want to treat your child to something totally unique
he was friendly engaging and an expert with a pair of shears
2 the owner jumped in after i complained and proceeded to use a utensil from the table next to mine that was being used on another client
my nails came out awesome  i wish i had came to her much sooner
they definitely know nutritional supplements and what will help you with your needs
this salon is clean and neatly organized so its obvious the owners care about cleanliness and having a peaceful environment
you can tell she was new to the job but even took the opportunity to show us a couple of product recommendations and even let us walk away with a few samples to take home
the price was great and the art he produced is amazing
you wont regret it
the entire place is really clean and bright which is very comforting
i posted the obligatory posthaircut selfie to facebook and bam
they finished both hair and makeup in roughly 40 minutes and both stayed perfect all day long
my stylist is shocked and asks whats it for
since there was no casino shopping center or theater to draw in the crowds it remained so quiet
my wife and i approached laticia and her first words were do you have any drugs
she didnt start from my cuticle so my nails already look like theyve grown out a week even though i just got them done yesterday
im especially picky when it comes to doing my nails if im paying that much i expect them to be perfect
maybe some of these concerns need to be expressed to a manager so they can work on this or maybe i just caught them all on a bad day
joey was great helping me on the phone and in person
we interviewed a few tattoo artists at other shops and we just didnt feel a connection with their personality or their art
she did a fantastic job on the layers and making my hair wavy
it was 12
walked in the day before christmas eve prepared to leave if there was a wait and there wasnt
the only thing i am not 100 satisfied with the place is and its not their fault really
my usual sprayer had to cancel last minute and i am departing to mexico tomorrow
i went in last night for a spray tan
he was meticulous and guarantees his work
all equipment used was right out of a sterile package and the room itself was very clean
i will continue to use elements massage summerlin and joey g as my therapist for the forseeable future
everyone at this location was very helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxing
if you have a little who likes to get polish done this is a great place
ive gone to grateful head for almost two years now
ny nails has this mastered
i love it
this place is actually very nice
compared with kimptons usual attention to room furnishings and design these digs are mildmannered
the moment i walked in they took my coat offered me a drink while i waited for my stylist
i liked the hair color a lot
i have a little more than shoulderlength hair
worst haircut ive ever received in my life
so there are a lot of kids swimming in the pool fyi
salon was exceptionally clean
its not very expensive depends on who you see
i got the japanese hair straightening treatment or permanent straightening and its been over 4 months my hair looks great
terriblleterriblemy husband and i stopped in to get our nails donehe had a manicure and they didnt even cut his cuticles and left his hands in waterno massage or anything and i had a full set with gel put on and they were real thick and they ouldnt even paint a french manicure onthe line was all messed upthis place sucks and they didnt even care when i told them i was not happyi cant believe this place is still open for businessnail techs had no isea what they were doing
heres the rundown of how i enjoy the place early morning appointment for massage  rose does fantastic hot stone  i like her the best
soft wax is what she uses and if i also got a addl wax for free bc i checked in
i have been very specific with what i wanted done
and theyre right i really shouldnt have
friendly nice guy good convo but most importantly does good hair
hours  monsat 930 am to 730 pm  sunday 12 pm to 5 pm  walk in welcome
even though i did not purchase that product i knew more about her product that might influence my next purchase
i was a little nervous booking a male for a prenatal massage but so glad i did
they are absolutely beautiful and he did a superb job
will follow him everywhere now
the store should be embarrassed
she has gain a loyal customer
they should either limit the amount of groupons they are going to sell if they dont want to serve that many or just dont do them at all
the locker room is also equipped with almost everything you would need
i havent called about the actual price of the services but i believe he made up that number
matt does fantastic color  listens to what a client wants and makes you feel comfortable
arthur and his crew take their time and make sure you are getting exactly what you want
i decided not to return after i asked for a price and the nail tech started yelling in vietnamese and turned and walked away
and oh yeah its just up the street from me so theres that whole convenience thing
it was very easy to make an appointment and the staff is sweet
in town with hubby for a conference
a quick swing through the arms and i mean quick as my hands didnt get any relief
weswegen vermte ich dass mein friseur nicht symmetrisch und ohne bestimmte form ist
it was my fault asking for it
well its because i was not able to experience this fully since i have really bad vertigo
it was 6 when i called
she is very caring and professional
thank you saba for giving our little kainoa a great cut
wow i needed this
as a business owner myself i know you cant make everyone happy and negative reviews hurtbut in the end the good out weighs the bad
room service was great and fast
i dont know about anyone else but i go here to relax
greatest barber in town
i made an appointment for a the hydrating facial at 12 pm
i have gotten many massages from many different places but never have i signed up for a membership until i found this place
will is amazing
i suggest the folks at folicle remember that moving forward
my male masseuse was unbelievable and the massage was the best massage i have ever hadand ive had plenty
first timer here
i was asked my name and then told that i would have to wait 10 minutes
the ladies were awesome
i was first introduced to hard wax when i was deployed and since then ive done my own legs underarms and a lot of the bikini area too chicken to do it all the way
will never be back
i have long pointy cat claws and the lady shaped it perfectly to match the others it looks even better than the other ones
their prices are also decent and they do a quality job
she said it was included in the price already so it was free
my pedi was very good manicure below average
no really
shes not too rough and shes very consistent with her work
she is incredibly knowledgeable about cuts color and needs for special hair types like my silverplatinum over processed hair
price is similar at 25 the chairs arent as fancy but ive never had a barber that was as consistently good as halim over at ralphs
anyways its too bad that im beginning to doubt the cleanliness of this place  because that was the main reason i went here in the first place
the bathroom didnt seem to update but clean
ive never felt more beautiful
i just want to preface this review real quick although i am sure all of the stylists here are very talented this review is specifically for tanya
just got done with my second tan and already getting where i need to be
thank you salon dshayn
papa squat outside before attemping in there
first off there were only three people working and people were coming in every five minutes
jenny has been doing my nails for 6 years guess i wont be getting my nails done her anymore
the lady that did my nails said this was the first time somebody complained about her service and i go to reviews and see more than myself complained
the man who did my nails was amazing
the place itself is not fancy nor does not offer any spa like services but they do great and shaping quality eyebrows do not expect a fancy 5 star place
my stylist was gary the owner
he went down the street to cvsmuch better pharmacy services there
other than ellice i have only had one other person touch my hair
my new shellac manicure is flawless
for clean simple nails and the best pedi youve ever had see lisa ladelfa
i will never go back there
i started to come here in 2011 and i loved neos
will definitely make this spa a staple of all future vegas trips
i thought the place was great
they have so many diff colors for the acrylic
i took my grandmother for her birthday to get a pedicure and she was in pain when the nail tech punched her calf to hard and continue to do it
everything from my original review is still valid but i needed to add some more info from other visits i have had recently
we come in no money is collected up front and price is not discussed with us
my stylist was a very sweet girl and i enjoyed my conversation with her
he chatted with me briefly and was extremely helpful
came here to redeem a 39 groupon for a cut fine print read 20 extra for long hair which lucky me i have
you can find them on any street corner and they all offer just about the same services
she was so sweet and did a fabulous job  i get a better cut at lomasi than any overpriced scottsdale or chandler salon
very talented tatooists hygenic environment
i decided to yelp for a local barber and these guys popped up
their pedicures are amazing they take their times with them and make sure that they are going you your moneys worth
after reading their website and seeing all the beautiful nail art photos here i decided to give this place a shot
it was a little on the claustrophobic side
i was there at 230
update the owner reached out to me via email and is issuing a refund check
i dont believe there is a limit to the amount of people allowed in for the water circuits and it can look and become quite trashy
he did an amazing job and she was thrilled
update i have also seen jamie and i didnt think it could get any better
i researched other companies but kept coming back to them
kevin is the absolute best and does gel nails which is difficult to find
our piercer finally arrived and he came over introduced himself and said give him a few minutes to get set up and sterilize his equipment
massages facials and manipedi professional melissa is amazing too
so i will not be returning to spring valley barber shop
i will definitely return and ask for mirka again
left super satisfied
will come back and recommend to family and friends
go to her if you want a perfect ten nails
that is how you will get 5 star from me
i went in with dark hair and was trying to get it back to my natural lighter colour and he did such a great job with the highlights it looks so natural
i wish more time was spent on my back glutes and hamstrings
he ignored me and continued to scrap my toe with the tool and i yelled stop and he said well i have to remove the dead skin there
we arrived a little before the appointment and checked in
he mixed together the perfect color gave me a great cut and gave me a great blow dry style
i was told that someone would call me back
save your money
i expected to wait for a bit since i was a walkin but elizabeth took me immediately
she made feel incredibly comfortable because she was so unbelievably professional
she is literally the best hair extension expert in az
i cant wait to start seeing results and will definitely be back and doing more areas of my body
i spoke with candice and we scheduled my appointment for the next day which was a saturday
i have chronic neckshoulder pain and his massage therapy treatment is exactly what my body needs
dr hankins suggested i wait a year to make sure it was really what i wanted
great place half off tuesdays as well
i also i went with a friend so we both got 5 dollars off it was a great deal
a playhround for chinese youths
the store is a hidden gem in a big plaza but it is one of best salons i found
i said i dont need your 45 credit too have it
they certainly arent the only spa with this policy
she is quick and good
same great service at reasonable prices
overall i loved my experience and will be back
we had a wedding reception for 47 guests on the 20th floor in the super plush canyon suite
the room service food was sooooooooooo good not to mention how fast it got there
another reviewer noted the lackadaisical attitude of the workers to customer modesty
the spa was quaint and lovely
mine is at least twice as dark as his
i am 100 not afraid to admit that i fake bake every now and then
though with his southern roots he could most likely rock that hair nice and high but if he says its not his thing its not his thing  but if you want an amazing cut or hair color done so well everyone swears it must be natural  go to eddie
well ive done that and more
she proceeds to soak off the peeling polish then finishes the pedicure already in progress as she speaks to another nail tech in vietnamese
i highly recommend her to anyone wanting to check out rumors
and the place is a little tacky looking to be honest
konnies my first experience with a needle or permanent makeup
and if you value your privacy it looks like she only books one client at a time because its just her working her own spa
she does a fantastic job and is always super friendly
and the foo that did my nails
i was tattooed by captain dave who had a nononsense approach to his work
each pedicure station is equip with a massage chair   option
i went to several of the most expensive stylist in the east valley who stated that my hair would completely break off if they touched it
they always accommodate me quickly even in large groups
my hair is short
threading is amazing
she always does a great job and i love getting compliments on my hair thanks to natalia
i havent had any problems with the healing process and now i have found my new place that i will get my work done
the program works when you follow it
this is my new branch
it was honestly one of the best pedicures ive ever had
ummhow about thick crooked white tips with blurry lines that fade into the pink portion of your nail not crisp at all and looks like a 5year old kid decided to play with mommys cosmetics
it is not at all painful and i get compliments after almost every visit
the polish he used was old or something bc it has bubbles and feels rough
i will have to review them later
she dyed the top part of my hair orange and kept the underneath blk and my roots yellow
sparkledragons has a little something for everyone and i mean everyone
theres no appointments but i got there at 3 on a tuesday and only was a 10 minute wait
he came in on a tuesday when the ship is usually closed
theres a doorbell
you get what you pay for
she is professional reasonable priced and very quick with services
crystal did a wonderful job with my hair
im into the extravagant and dramatic type of stuff for my hair
in search for a massage therapist for my neck and shoulder problems i decided to choose toronto bodyworks based on the many pleasant experiences other yelpers have had
im so torn on this store
there is a hot tub and splash pad within the area as well and lots of activities like horseshoe corn hole ping pong bouncy and a couple other things
did i mention  that
they have a huge selection of both gel and regular polish
did not stay at the hotel but we walked around
i am disappointed
this place is crawling with creepers
of course you have to walk thru the casino to get to the room elevators
i absolutely love my nails
changing room amenities are high quality robes body wash shampoo eucalyptus spray etc
im satisfied and i will go back again
her name is amanda
dont waste your time at overpriced places on the strip just give her a call and get better looking skin from a beautiful woman who is passionate about her work
whats the point of spending all that money if the color will only last less than one day
although she was nice and environment was enjoyable it just didnt compensate for my less than mediocre manicure and pedicure
i understand some sort of charge but full price
my toe nails and feet dont feel like i just got a pedicure
the owner was able to fit me in that very same evening and even kept the salon open at least 45 minutes past closing to finish the job
the male nail techs watch tv while giving you a pedicure
absolutely love this place if youre looking for a great nail tech i recommend vee mimi or nick all of who are absolutely amazing
all the technicians are super nice too
she was very professional friendly and timely
terrible customer service and terrible work
right across from the gorgeous 47th st entrance to the cemetery and not too far from new amsterdam bar and ambiance vintage shop
this location however does a good job of maintaning wait times in line considering just how busy they can get at any given hour of the day
for a vegas salon not on the strip but worth the little drive to be charged what i was charged was a delight for all the work and effort she put into my style
does realistic tattoos
3 if your workout includes proprioception or anything remotely related to dr clark and nasm they have pretty standard fare except they have just 2 stability balls neither of which is suitable for average or taller people
see you guys soon
when the massage is over they take you to a very cool coed lounge area
so i will never bring my kids again
i will be a member here for many more years
id definitely return to look around next time im in the area
none of my subsequent appointments were on time i was always left waiting in the hall for someone to show up or sitting on the couch because they fit in an appointment before me without letting me know i would be pushed back to a different time
he said it was definitely not good
that was the first day
i signed up for the bikini line wax complimentary brow underarm or bikini line wax for women or ear nose or brow for gents
my masseuse full committed english but his foot massage was below par
so much cleaner with living up to their name of relaxing
ive been to the other threading places and patels is far superior
i mean seriously didnt even bother cleaning the brushes just put them back in the community drawer
and since my former stylist had moved across country id put off finding a new one for some time
i am giving this review 5 stars partly on a leap of faith because it is still a developing business
he transferred my hair into a beautiful caramel balayage and over the years i went more blonde then more chestnutred in the fall and recently chopped it all off to my shoulder
i took a friend there for a birthday blow out and we both loved it  couldnt wait to come back and us my groupon
my real nails are out grown over the actual acrylic
very precise and did an absolutely great job on my nails
she said this in a very arrogant condescending tone
ill give it one more shot but this time with a different barber
vivian is amazing
all this for the low price of 33
they have excellent recommendations as well go above and beyond for making sure the customer is happy
she also mixed in some products that i already had and mentioned so i didnt feel like i needed to buy all new products
ok now on to the establishment
im happy with me experience here
if it was an easy repair i wouldnt be as mad
elle demande ce que lon souhaite et dit ce quelle pense faire
next time im vegas theyll be one of the 1st stops
i got a dealchicken deal for a night here and was super excited to check it out
i just had my first wax done yesterday by alex
hmmmmmaybe theyre related
its not pretentious
its a must see
the several weeks since my hair has been falling out more than normal and i have some bare spots on my scalp i never had before
antigym rat attitude
im really glad i tried out kens nails and spa and i definitely will be returning
its obvious that jason cares about his clients
i am not very pleased with them
this was one of those experiences i could have mistakenly thought i could live withoutso happy i took advantage of the free service
now ive had this done before with zero discomfort so was ok with it
my hair looks so cute and flawless and my friend feels the same way about hers
they are beautiful full and long lasting
would pay to hear him play over bette midler or cher any day
ive been coming here for years nd they alqays always get my hair done right
i was very disappointed1100 for a bar of soap 4 oznot worth itone time useterrible
about an hour and a half after checking in my fianc and i met in the coed lounge to wait for our therapists
sooo amazing she treated me so well
they give you clothes to wear when walking around the common area otherwise its full nude only
sorry for the pun
after 6 years i had to stop going because of the pain ive been inflicted by the clippers as well as the general lack of attention to detail in any way
i was angry at first but after a couple months of going elsewhere i decided to give it another try
i made a comment about just trying to be nice and still nothing
thanks for wasting my money and time body beautiful
i am not a fan of massage chairs so i dont really indulge in it but the ladies do a nice job massaging the legs and the hot rocks are a nice touch as well
beautiful courtyard to eat at well spaced tables with pretty accents and cute center pieces
love my nails
they offered water which was awesome since i walked in the vegas heat and didnt rush me at all
if you dont mind a simple no frills salon then this is it
he just sat in the chair playing with his phone
i fell asleep in a few rooms
im never disappointed with the quality here
set up is nice people are friendly deco is cool
she knows her stuff when it comes to hair
it looks rough and very ugly
denise is the best
not only did we catch her in a lie she also made the process very difficult and kept changing what we wanted even though we booked our appointment ahead of time without making any changes of our own
definitely plan on coming back with some girl friends
win win in my book
i think the car belonged to the lady working the front desk overnight and these bitches didnt get their way so they had to be dicks
she knows exactly what color do do to make me look flawless
before she would even start she said she had to have my credit card to take to the front desk to be run before treatment
holly is the most amazing stylist
they finally gave me loretta who was super sweet and nice but still didnt overall fix my hair
although she was quite small she was built and i could tell she knew what she was talking about or she was taking all of it hahaha
for the price and if you want fast friend service this is the place for you
they sanitize all of their tools accordingly with sterilizers
the line is great though i still prefer to stick with the matrix line
the salon was super cozy with tons of natural light
i had blood work done the other day
will return for both my hair and nail services
just discovered it
a man named gary did our hair
while i was waiting i noticed that the nail salon had no music playing so that it was awkwardly silent and you couldnt have a conversation without feeling like everybody could hear you
no one even greeted us just to remind you the store wasnt even busy there was only one other customer getting her makeup done
bought a groupon for this spa and was totally satisfied with the service
she now does my kids hair too
it smells nice
chanel did my makeup for my wedding
i finally decided my color and she proceeded to do my nails
i just got cut no color and this was the best haircut ive had in a while
6hours is not bad for the hair style i got its full and veryyyyy long
also the place could have used a cleaning
olivia was my waxologist and she did a great job
what i find most troubling was that the owner had seen this go down but did not approach the situation until i had asked to speak to her
i found it on and end cap with a sign that said 2 off regular 799
the hospitality was awesome and you cant beat the prices
ive had worse
he was probably making them even so they all looked uniformed
the first time was for a manipedi both of which came off well
there is a ton of elliptic machines if your into that
i took off a star because i felt the place could be a little bigger
i dont care if youre having a bad day
its always clean and organized
i started going to lennys barber shop when i moved to the area and very glad i ventured in
then i met armando  it was instant chemistry and i definitely wanted him all up in my hair
freakin awesome for vegas
ive had shellac manicures every two weeks for the past year so this had never happened
im telling everyone about this place
she answered on the 1st call set me up with an appt a few hours after i called and on a very busy saturday
ask for serena if you want outstanding service and color
he was fast and accurate and it came out amazing
worst nails i have ever gotten
and the value of my coupon was obviously phenomenal
and a small detail but the nail polish selection is a little hard to see as they have their bottles of polish stacked three or four colors deep in a rack
most i would describe as very fresh and clean smelling
faith is amazing i saw faith for a long time until i moved an hour away
as an added bonus i got strong compliments from 4 people in the first 45 minutes out the salon door
ive had samuel as my stylist for over 15 years and cannot say enough about his amazing hair styling skills
unfortunately this was not the case during my most recent visit to ocean spa and nail
what i am very pleased about your place is that each massage is taylored to my specific concern and more importantly besides being relaxing it is therapeutic each massage tackles the tissue involved and not just those simple rubbings from other commercial places
went there for a facial appointment and have a few points to say booking  there wasnt many available slots to book they primarily have hair cuts so keep that in mind
if you have an idea they can help you bring it to life

i think every single mani and pedi chair was occupied
you wont be disappointed
i was hoping the addition of a new gm would make the club a better place
facials are supposed to be relaxing and soothing yes extractions may sometimes be uncomfortable but this was far beyond the uncomfortable stage
they have rooms with 2 massage chairs that are perfect for couples or for friends hanging out chatting and getting a great massage
and they dont take no for an answer they just continue to pitch to you
this was one of the worst tanning experiences i have ever had
the hair quality wasnt the best some of the brands they were selling went out of business during the recession so it was interesting to see some old products i used back in the early 2000s but i just think even that is over priced
had a 30 minute sauna followed by 90 minute session with the rmt
they know their stuff
took my mom there the 1st time and along with no on that can speak english they were sewing curtain barriers right there in the front
myumi always does my nails and is amazing

if you are looking for a new nail place to try i suggest you check kt nails out
i think she did a phenomenal job on my eyelashes
so i would recommend it
really cheap and includes hot stone massage and polish
the warm and hot classes are my favourite especially when the sun is shinning in the big room
the moral of this story  nail sense has done a wonderful job over the years at proving it provides the best nail service i myself have had my regular manicures done before
but now i think they lowered their standards in hiring people
i will definitely be going back on the regular
i have never received such poor customer service at any other hotel
she loves getting her fullset done by yen
the surprise i got was now that they have approximately 93100 of my money for unused massages they wont let me use any of the credits ive already paid 4900 each for while the payments for future massages are frozen
i know that they have to be under the light for a minimum of 2 minutes experience
esther youre the best i will remain your customer and will recommend you to all of my family and friends
the room was also dimly lit and krista totally made the experience comfortable
so i will never ever stay here again
except no after further reading 90 of these great ratings are for the girl who does the eyebrow threading
overall the gym is about average and you get what you pay for 44 mth
you can tell that they really enjoy their work and believe in what float toronto has created
he was really nice to chat with during the inking
this includes things such as 25 total for dress shoes 12 for dress shirts 25 for sport coats 17 for kakhis and so on
they run specials often
i wish natasha and the whole gang a wonderful new year and more business your way
she was so sweet and gentle ans still did a great job
the interior is very nice and clean and the employees are very caring and social
prices were also reasonable
this qa went on so long the nail tech next to me had to turn off my water to prevent it from overflowing
these sisters are the best duo ever
when the medication she prescribed wasnt working fast enough for me i called and she was quick to give me something else try
sometimes haircuts seem to get better after the hair has grown a bit
i am thrilled to have lydia as my hair stylist knowing that she will always take care of me
i do want one more best believe when i do get it ill get it there and specifically from billy harris
my review may be better if i had more than 3 hours of sleep and didnt have to call security  twice
i was so worried that getting a wax after my terrible one was going to be immensely painful because the ingrowns hurt and were sore and tender
he was very friendly non pushy and knowledgeable
lynette was nice but i saw absolutely no lasting results after using my groupon for 6 laser treatments
i love my glitter toes
first time visit
we called the desk and was told there was a long list of maintenance issues so it would be a while
as she got started she asked me what i did for a living and i told her im a hairstylist
the salon was clean and nice looking
i feel wonderful tens years are gone from my face

the facility is nice
this location not only offers a great location but also has a great stylist
joylynn was awesome and the overall session was very relaxing
he is absolutely the best
i have tried so many nail salons in pittsburgh and was so close to give up and accept the way they do badly my nails
these people are sketchy
ill be going to other sephoras from now on
i go here all the time and love it
i really enjoyed my time here and would definitely go back
that flatiron was amazing my hair has never been so straight a very curly haired person here
i am from the northeast but next time i am in the scottsdale area whether it be for vacation or work
the swelling isnt bad at all
and i was right
she is so sweet and humble
i am a woman with thinning hair and am very sensitive about it
he also did a fabulous job on the design
i love the candles most of all and the fall scents are my absolute favorite
my mom and i went there yesterday to get our nails done
love cherry lash lounge
the place is very modern and the message chairs were great
i cant say enough great things about my stylist araceli
the spa chair massage is definitely a bonus
5 star salonand im a guy  tried several other places since weve been coming to vegas over the past 5 years but nothing ever came close to pico madama  value service ambience talent is stellar
many thanks to dr walter
been going here for years and has always been good service
her pricing is also right on trend with other stylists in vegas
my nail tech luu did a fantastic job
when i arrived to checkin they told me that i had to pay the 20night resort fee and i was shocked that i was misinformed
never once did she ask to help meonly stared
he switches from one mode to the other and when he goes into piercing mode and explains every step in detail whether its sterilization or the procedure
wasted 40 minutes wishing i was home and in bed just because they couldnt waste their time calling my name
if your going to vegas to just party and dont cook full meals this is not the place for you
sometimes they have coupons for 1 haircut
i hope the ohio cosmetology board checks these reviews and pays a visit
i was having issues with my neck and shoulders
will definitely go again during my time in arizona
the tropical rain has like animal soundsvaries the light  can go from warmhotcold with different amounts of water
i looked around extensively taking in everything
ill definitely be coming back soon
instead of properly fixing it he just layered on another coat of the color polish and then rushed me over to the manicure station
we come back at 1am and its not done
it was a nice spacious store with multiple seats but only one woman working
i probably will not go back and stick with the original place i go to
a great overall experience but not without a few hiccups
what kind of excuse is that
i cant remember the womans name who did my nails that day but when i do ill update my reviewshe did a nice job on my toes and feet but the nails are another story when it came to my gel polish manicure i noticed she wasnt painting my entire nailthe sides and back near the cuticle of the nails were unpainted
i get to club tattoo and chipp decides to blow me off so he can finish someones tattoo
my husband was dealing with an upset stomach and so this delayed our time for leaving
furthermore katie talked about her first kiss dating life and sexual partners
im funny about getting my hair cut as from experience not everyone does the job rite and they aint got the skills
he gives excellent advice on dryer fire prevention and repairs
one staff member called me back and said i must talk to their administrator or i can make a paid appointment with the doctor
omg it was glorious
the first thing we noticed was the high prices
i got my haircut done by stacey and i am super super picky and love it
after 2 weeks of waiting i called his shop and asked for a response since we needed to lock down an appointment for 4th of july weekend
but lately when ive been going back here their prices went up
such a good deal if you join the monthly club
oh sorry i got off track
1 she only pushed back my cuticles did not use the cuticle clipper to remove the excess cuticles or even take off my hang nails around the nails
thanks for a great visit
last visit i bought this body souffle by this company named bask
they were not appreciated
i ended up buying them online later anyway because of the amazingly soft bouncy and frizzfree way they made my hair
they have such an amazing and friendly staff
one good sign was that i liked the hair styles of all the stylists there and every client that was finished while i was there
worse experience ever dont recommend it
my daughter smiled the entire time she was getting her hair shaved off
ive been to polished in south park before and ive not been impressed so i dont know why i thought the new one in stonecrest would be any different
lol people are annoying
decided to get my original earring put back in at depression ink since it was a lot closer to home and since it was a low risk procedure didnt think it would make a huge difference where i went simply putting in an earring  note i could not do it on my own since it is small and i cannot see the inside of my ear to screw it in
he told us to go to their other store but they werent open till another hour and we werent sure if that place was a great place either because the place was really in a bad area
my stylist was tina and i must say it was probably the best decision i ever made coming here and finding tina
its a joy to spend time with such a lovely bunch of creative openminded welcoming professionals when many other shops ive experienced offer mediocre bedside manner at best seriously even when im cringing in pain and begging for a wipe theyre the dearest bunch
bottom line he knows what hes doing
i also have white spots and dark spots that werent there when i came in and when i asked about them the girl quietly said something about culture and i dont even know
she did a great job
the  staff is kind friendly and helpful
i should have just told her to lighten up
love it there
i have been getting stiletto nails for a few years now and i have had some pretty bad ones in that time that just werent up to my standards
they are also nice
i really like this nail salon
we had requested a room close to the pool but not so close that we had no privacy
i had an apt across the street
shes awsomevery beautiful and nice
how can they ban me from not doing anything
my feet used to be so bad they would tear the sheets on the bed they were so rough
cut and color that are as good or better than any place in cleveland
the check in staff was great even granted us a late check out
sharla was great
in addition she kept asking me questions as to how i was feeling and if one technique helped more compared to another
small things like my nails being slightly uneven or when i get dark polish you can see through it in some places or one hands nails being longer than the others
limited counterspace in bathroom
the atmosphere is very welcoming everyone very friendly
i came in requesting rose quartz marbled nails and i gave ly a picture and she did an incredible job
the juniors section would be okay if i was about ten years younger but now its just inappropriate
i went to get a manicure with a friend and had a positive experience here
still same nude but now gel
over prescribing antibiotics
ive looked in my area for awhile to find a decent nail salon
i cant believe how much she did in one hour she did magic on me
you cant even see the birds beak because its so merged with the wing
but nope here it is
the girl who did my mom and sisters hard demanded to be paid in cash
she didnt want me going home and getting frustrated so she spent a good amount of time showing me tricks
all the times ive been here everyone makes sure theyre doing a good job making sure their customer are happy
besides that my visit went smoothly
i would recommend them to anyone looking for a safe and comfortable environment for their child
shave was quite expensive for this area more like downtown chicago prices think art of shaving but the experience wasnt very nice and relaxing
she walked away speaking her language to another lady and then came back and told me to wait so she could go look for some more  sorry been there done that before
the reviewers are right
the color was off from what i chose not sure if he was being skimpy or he got the wrong one from what i picked
i felt like a princess all day
i never write reviews but after my conversation with their employee amber i must
gel polish i chose looked different on every finger  from half transparent to almost dark
for the same price as tns i can get an excellent manicurepedicure i havent tried other services in a much better atmosphere and with way better results
as far as i can tell its only staffed by two male italian barbers and a woman hairdresser they take appointments and walkins
my extra trip to the bank to go bring back a tip made this even less enjoyable
beautiful walls made of real sand from the desert and water fall makes for a calming but yet dramatic effect
the nails didnt even fit my natural nail properly
she used a hard wax which is a wax that doesnt have strips with it
she didnt do the best job especially at 10 for a polish 5 tip
these ladies are great
also i brought my 4 year old daughter which can be a headache at times but the girls were patient with her and even painted her nails as well
its tucked away behind a run down shopping center super dark on the inside kinda creepy
first and foremost its clean and the staff is exceptionally friendly
over charged me lied to me
fortunately ive found something that works for me to shed those extra pounds
she worked on all the areas i had mentioned felt sore and knew exactly where my knots were
i gave them three tries but that it
theres a lot of foot traffic but they make sure to greet everyone and everyone is all pretty friendly
not the best place for nails though
no wonder why they dont have any pictures of their work on the website
loved the full kitchen
i did see couples or friends come and spend some time at the pool area while i was at the gym but the quiet theme was in effect here much more than my other spa experiences at the strip
my hair was very challenging because of the length and even the color
she really knows how to work with your muscle tension and smoothes out the tension
finally and i say finally after only 56 minutes of talking to him he snapped at us by saying just dont waste my time
but their service is so bad that i gave up on that too  i got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble but the last time i went in i had called ahead to put my name in and was told that i would be next on the list and to show up in about 20 min
got my teeth to a 2 level
although my toes look pretty the customer service sucked and the salon wasnt very clean
so i told them i was going to leave and just to forget about it then two ladies came and one worked on each hand and did the shellac
i actually went to wise chiropractic before this location but did not feel that the chiropractor was right for me
clean professional quaint little salon
thumbs up elizabeth
and she was the one who cut my nails way to short as i was telling her to leave them wtf should i pay for the full set when i came in for a fill
when he sat me down and put that horrible mumu thing on me he gave me a blue one to match my eyes
i got the hotstone pedi for 22 extra for design and was offered the same plus coffee from their kuerig
my massage and vischi shower were both pretty good i wouldnt say amazing but they were definitely good
they couldnt get us in for nearly two weeks which was unusual for a salon this big and it wasnt during peak season or anything
the place is beautiful the chairs r super comfortable and the pedicure stations are fantastic
kelly amanda and eddie are really good at what they do
lets just say it added to the experience of awesome
if you are at all paranoid about laser treatments and skins treatments like me i did a ton of research before going here  this is a place where you can feel like you are in good professional hands
i knew my hair was going to look better than it was because it really couldnt have gotten worse but the outcome left me speechless
this was the best massage i ever hadperiod
i called and made an appt
after reading all the great and positive reviews here on yelp i decided to make an appointment with maria
my hair looks like somebody sat a bowl on my head and cut around it
the end result is really impressive
i purchased the classic full set of eyelash extensions and couldnt be happier with the result
she began stating were i would be delivering the baby and i reminded her my chart said i was doing home birth to which she bluntly said then why am i seeing you
i realize it was 5 min until they close but this was no fault of mine so i asked if she could fix it
i believe some of these suitespenthouses have been bought and get rented out through luxury suitesthus they have their own operating system room service was the main thing i noticed
val is great at what she does and knows how to make you feel super comfortable well as comfortable as you can get with a bunch of needles stabbing you at once
65 for 75mins includes facial and hand massage
it was my first time getting pink and white acrylics
she just goes to town on my feet and toes and most of the time it was uncomfortable
ps if youre looking for a good deal on sushi mondaywednesday drive down the road to island sushi for their 50 off all rolls
really lovely job but disappointed that i couldnt get the complimentary shea butter whip with the express pedicure
no chips no cracking no discoloration just growing out which i obviously cant control
grateful to hear other clients have had good experiencesthat is hopeful for the spa
i received so many compliments on my hair and makeup mostly from drunk women but you know the truth comes out when people are drunk
even though they were closing soon they didnt rush our cuts at all
my mother and i came in on a tuesday evening and it seemed like we were inconveniencing them to walk in and get our toes done
specifically joseph volpe seriously amazing stylist articulate experienced and up to date on styles cuts and of course color
like a previous poster im not sure they even used gel polish rather i think it was regular polish with a gel top coat
got in and out within 20 minutes they did a nice clean job
polite service staff
and rather than having space under my finger nails like you normally should underneath my nails were literally filled with acrylic that connected to my skin
she filled them beautifully and just to my liking
called to make a lash appointment they have no techs to do lashes nor do they know when theyll be getting any the girl who answered the phone olivia was so rude and hung up on me while i was still talking
i like the welcoming aura of the place and i will definitely be coming back
they use epsom salt on their pedicures and they left my feet super soft  white
the day after my treatment rita reached out to see how i was doing after my first treatment
the atmosphere is nothing special the only reason they got 4 stars instead of 5 it is your run of the mill nail salon but my nail tools were taken out of an autoclave in plain view big points for that
she is truly the bestshe has an amazing personality that makes your time spent with her so relaxing fun and enjoyable
now the important thing avoid the food
slick nails on ann rd in north las vegas
he listened was incredibly priced and beyond friendly
ive never before had a stylist who does this
i worked and entire crossword puzzle and scanned two magazines before she returned about 4560 minutes later
i recently had a private tennis lesson and the instructor made me feel completely comfortable despite my severely underdeveloped tennis skills
my husband told him what he wanted and chad delivered a masterpiece
i can only give my best recommendations to this webshop
and because it is very close to my home i will definitely consider 702 nail lounge for my next fill
room was spinning
i hate to give this location such a low rating because the front desk staff are usually  nice but i have had more issues with their front desk and scheduling then anyone should have to deal with
the advertised black out curtains are not in fact black out
it was a wonderful reminder of why i go to her only
the threading was also a lot less painful than my previous threading experiences
the pool area though is a party area with loud music and rude people so be prepared
i trust these ladies implicitly
it may have been a one time deal but man that is a terrible thing to have happen two days before your wedding
i wish i could love verde salon but my three or so experiences left me to search for another stylist in the valley
he then turned me over to someone else to do my cut
the staff is friendly the nail techs are efficient but detail oriented and the salon atmosphere is nice
talk about cool
the beds are comfortable the rooms are spacious and the property is quiet
the game room has pingpong billiards big screen tv couches tables books  free dvd rentals
dont go there they will just do the bare minimum
its hit or miss with this place
we left and went to club tattoo and they were amazing
the first sign was that this merchant forgot to put my scheduled massage on her schedule and emailed me 30 minutes before my massage to tell me not to come
i was extremely relaxed the aesthician was very gentle and afterwards my face felt amazing
the toiletries available in the locker room are good quality and they have many items available for use so thats a plus
i do find them to be a little small and not coed but no worries
the sales associate didnt know much about too faced products even though she was working in that section
thanks again nick
however luckily enough my stylist was able to see me right away so yay for that
i asked her why and she said she wanted to show me how to do my hair at home
but the service and talent still makes it a great value
she knows exactly how much pressure to apply without causing pain
things have gone downhill tremendously
great products and service
lobg story short this place is a ridiculously overpriced dump and all they care about is money
once we settled on the look she went to town on my hair fixing a bad mushroom cut and successfully transforming it into an edgyfun angled bob with a fringe
thank you kathy
their processes were very clean and only opened items in front of me
i have another tan to use but i would never go back to this company again i will stick to dolce
i was at blo dry bar today and this was my first experience
easy to find location off scottsdale road and mescal just north of shea
first time in vegas i have had anyone do my  nails how i like them including my feet
they do have a few opi hues but i dont think i saw more than about 8 bottles and they werent up to date colours
pleasant reception area that offered drinks and lite snacks
i love their work and everyone is very nice
i love that she listens and doesnt push me into anything
at noon on a friday i called in a panic for a quick haircut for a wedding that night
after one day my ear was so swollen the earring was sinking into my skin
he did a great job i will make this my go to place for hair treatment
i have been a client for around 4 years and i will keep going back
so at least the ambiance was relatively okay
i just got the gel manicure  pedicure which was reasonably priced
they use the best products moroccanoil living proof etc
what i didnt like is having to lay back with my feet hanging into the bucket was very uncomfortable
one word marvelous
you have me as a client forever
i am very particular just like everyone else where i get my haircut
i forget her name but the lady that does the eye brown waxing is pretty good
i treated myself to the 15 hr treatment because i could not believe how reasonable the prices were
not a good value for money
but they were unhappy with our 15 each tip
and price is very affordable
i have to say i love this place
i used to go to a shop that charged way more until i came here
my skin had become oily had black heads pimples white heads dark spots and for good measure cholesterol pimples
although i do live in scottsdale i plan on making the drive out to chandler for a quality haircut
i first met her after i needed an experienced hairdresser to fix my poor color job that another stylist did
worst customer service ever
utensils were clean and service was efficient
if you recall my last post you remember i was eager to give this place another chance after my last horrific encounter
und da fielen sie die zauberworte so schneiden dass deine lngen volumen bekommen und nicht so ausgednnt sind
they have a variety of services and offered me upgrades multiple times
ive been going to cherry lash for a few months now and ive always gone to caro lash artist she was so sweet when i first came in
will be going back again
in any case their policy is that they all needed to speak english and no speaking in vietnamese as it makes the customers uncomfortable
i can confidentially say i just found my new salon and stylist
you will not regret it for a second
the pool was not huge and i found it to be very relaxing which was perfect for me and my kids
my friend and i were immediately greeted coming in the door with no appointment
the nail tech was the receptionist up and down answering the phone shouting at other nail techs across the room and waiting on walk in customers during my manicure
the manager had me come back to see a doctor they had hiredhe looked frightened when he saw my lips
we had 2 gel pedis one normal pedi one acrylic fill one new set of acrylics and one gel manicure for 3 people total and it was 240 before tip
i told her i had an appointment with tiffany and she went to the back presumably to let tiffany know i was there
but yesterday i had fills by jennifer and she did an awful  job
the total was 60 for the manipedi
it is now two weeks and one day after i went to the salon and one week after a very active beach vacation and my finger and toe nail polish is barely even chipped
so if it is worth a 200year fee to get a dollar or so off your botox units go here
tax and tip
ive had 3 different people cut my hair and all of them have taken good care of me
everything else meh ive had better
i said that she was going to do gel mani anyways and most good salons dont charge extra if you are getting another gel done
lol we are now all on the same cycle
the employees are super nice and welcoming and they do great work
however the staff were gathered around the front desk gossiping and i found this super annoying remember it was my first day and i hadnt relaxed yet
plus its very affordable and easy to share with friends
im so glad to have found this shop
no issues with her or any of the staff
the bathrooms were big and with decent lighting important
he was really friendly and i was in love with the finished product
my nail tech left halfway through didnt explain why she was leaving or what was happening and someone named steven replaced her
this review is for the salon only
ive been to many massage places in both az and ca and this is by far one of the best
dont go here  there are so many better nail salons in charlotte
if you come here make sure to ask for tracy
they are always accommodating and get me in and out quickly
i will definitely stay here again if in the area
i went to the bronze bar for my first fake tanning experienceand i couldnt be happier
i would definitely stay here again
hes very skilled and takes the time to explain the pros and cons of everything
most of the long term hairstylists were rubens assistants before having their own stations which is great cause ruben is a good hairstylist
the salon was exactly what i had expected from the website very clean crisp stylish and relaxing
seriously what is that
never went back there
being my first tattoo i knew exactly what i wanted to get and sent him an image
she didnt push to sell more but instead made ethical educated recommendations
lashes look amazing  they dont rush you out the door after an hour
im a very picky client i will admit and it took me a while to find the right hair dresser here but im so glad i never gave up
awesome service and very affordable
i mean like really when i visit this store its to get something i really need like legal drugs a prescription filled or some scrappy makeup on sale because i dont wanna drive out to the mac kiosk
i couldnt help myself and picked up the goodbye lipstick
i appreciate that she kept asking me if its what i was wanting
i made the appointment for 530pm later that same day
she even bought fruit cookies and sparkling cider to help celebrate the day  it was a very sweet gesture
well hunnot on my eyes
otherwise the wait is probably an hour or more
thanks again saints and scissors you always get it right
shes really friendly and my highlights are always exactly what i ask for
i highly recommend you go here if your looking for the perfect color to make you feel and look amazing
she was easy to make an appt with through text or phone call
still i had a great nights sleep and enjoyed ordering a movie straight from the flat screen tv
i found the prices laughable anyway
receptionist has always been fine unlike the complaints here
the salon has a line that takes 6 coats
i love the set up of the salon its very spacious and clean
i am new to the area and she will be my stylist from now on
plus it wasnt busy for  saturday
the hydro facial is my absolute favorite and make my skin clear and glow
the gloves she put on were obviously used pulled over itself nail color already in it the tools didnt look clean the gel machine was not wiped down you can feel dried polish when you set your hands inside the foot file had been used several times already
if i feel like spring winter or fall they have the colors i am seeking
as a business owner they should try to fix the issue if a customer is unsatisfied
no flat irons the blowdryers were seriously lacking
the price was worth it since it was very clean and the staff was amazing
i truly hate getting up after a massage and would happily have a nap right after a massage
being a new customer he also gave me a great deal about ten dollars for my first week
this place rules
i was not impressed at all to say the very least
a superb business
i felt very comfortable and the appointment was very thorough
now we are running around
i really liked how she kept asking me if i had any questions and made me feel as if she was a friend that i was talking to as we went through the class
ladies and gentleman do not go to tan 7 in richmond hill
the whole process was relaxing beyond words
i am so dredging my manicure
the procedure was a bit uncomfortable pain was a 410 to me but totally worth it
she really did a great job giving me the full tourrefresh and explaining everything to me quickly with a bubbly attitude and demeanor as if i was the first customer of the day even though i came in late in the day
he has offices all over las vegas
i had a french tip gelacryllic refill and a pedicure
after about 3 days one of the balls did fall off i told her and she got me right back in and put a new one on
the call center is in the philippines and they do not want to give you your money back and at first its 5000 back and then its a little more and then its a 11000 and finally i say i will send this back to you but i want my money back and after speaking to a manager i get this agreement and so i ship this back fedex and will gladly take the cost because i made this mistake here by not reading the small print and instead i believed that if i liked this i could buy this again if i wanted not that i would be forced to pay 15790 for a tiny little bottle that held maybe a 10th of a ounce
really relaxing and fun environment
brad was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about products and current trends
my fianc received a call from the concierge the day before we arrived at 1030am a work day and the voicemail simply said to call back
dr smith puts you at ease and is very passionate about his work
i came in and was instantly greeted by the owner
thank you so much karen
then i got this look from him like so whats your problem  and he asked is everything okay
bottom line you will be nickel and dimed and burned unless you want to shell out 80 a month for their diamond level beds
jrs barber parlor is the place to be if you want quality service
i wont be going back
once i ventured here after a terrible experience at sweet nails i never looked back
however this was after months of headache and 80 of our guests had already booked aka i had already gone through the pain of booking them
she takes her time and does a thorough job
at 12 noon on a friday theyre booked up
i told her she should have let the lady know she didnt want them cut
finally a threading shop in south phoenix
basically  youre led into your own individual room with one of the floatation baths which from the outside looks like a personal space craft right out of star trek but you open it up and lo and behold
i just love this place
if you are looking for not only a great atmosphere but also amazingly beautiful hair i strongly suggest the root
great price  great location everyone is so nice and friendly
so lets start off by saying that this review is for everyone in the salon except eddie
i was very disappointed when i was told i didnt have an appointment with genevieve on wednesday august 13 at 515pm
thus though the package was wrapped  the contents were not heat sterilized
the location caters to the financial districts suitandtie types and their overinflated prices reflect that
it frustrates me that more people dont know what a gem they have out there in the desert
please find a different salon for better professional service i mean its not cheap here
a girl is trying to pamper herself here
they were great with the draping of the blankets and never once did my wife or i feel exposed
with out explaining
the decor is quite nice and neat
hes great hes got a lot of patience and hes pretty friendly
my husband  i were looking for a good barber shop when we found jesses shop
updated review everything can be fixed with some good old fashioned customer service
and they file down your real nails very thin
missy listens guides and talks you through the process
she just wasnt putting any kind of product in my hair
i felt much better and looked a lot better too
i was referred to dr mcelgunn from my primary care doctor for a tiny little mole on one of my toes
tina did such a great job on my nails i definitely will be going back to her such great customer service highly recommend to get your nails down there
they have a gym sauna indoor heated pool indoor hot tub and a beautiful outdoor heated pool with spa jets
elliot was right on time
the pool was nice and they have a good kids pool thats 3 feet deep
very professional and fast
this massage exceeded all of my expectations
izzy gave me a terrible cut didnt listen to a damn thing i said about what i wanted
my toes always looked fabulous and the polish would last a good 4 weeks
when the pedicure was done she said to make sure that i wait 10 minutes before leaving to give my nails a chance to dry
i waited about 10 more minutes before realizing snow would not be doing my pedicure
very friendly and welcoming
im very grateful for her help
the technicians just werent careful enough
the other issues i had were grade 4 capsular contracture left implant was popping out possible rupture  massive inflammation possibly infected biofilm that all sounded terrifying
i never feel rushed when i go there to get my eye brows and upper lip threaded
this girl has taste and is fashion forward when it comes to nail art if youre into 3djapanese nail artshe is incredible at this
my cousin and i were due to get our tattoos touched up
staff is friendly and you wont miss any sports action while youre waiting
pretty pretty please
i called james about 10 in the morning and scheduled to meet him at 1 the woman at the front desk was super nice and easy to talk to
if you are in the area and looking for a great nail place check it out
the man helped my friend and did a rather good job for what he wanted and i was treated by anna or ahna
lancy is as sweet and thorough as they come
it was our first time here and they never asked us if we preferred guys or girls
it is a piece of art that will be forever on your body
i hope people check yelp before buying groupons to socalled med spas
rochelle made me feel right at home and comfortable
so starting from the lobby the elevators are split so that floors above 28 i think
i recommend daybreak to others and i will be back
perfection in many ways
i have been a client of hers for several years and couldnt imagine going anywhere else
my first time in the salon today was fantastic
and bring warm fuzzy socks
he explained to me each step throughout my first adjustment
when i mentioned it her response was indifferent and she just added a ton of blush so i looked like a pale ghost with blush on finally after being there for an hour and forty five minuteness i had to go
the team at simply skin is so professional anahit the owner  puts you at ease right away explains the process in great detail and i really appreciated her chatting with me as a lovely little distraction technique throughout the whole process
i sat down in the chair and we chatted for nearly the whole two hours it took her to apply the lashes and she took pictures of my lashes for me
the room was ok but not special
the haircut itself was much better being only sub par
you couldnt get us to go anywhere else now even if the service was free
not only did i find her rude they are also way too busy for you i understand that other spas can be busy as well but they make sure their being busy is not the clients problem and make it invisible to the clients
i will never use anyone else
it was such a letdownbrusque to the point of rudeness
i called the shop right away and asked if there was a way for me to get them fixed the next day
absolutely awesome service
when you make an appointment ask for himhe takes his time but it is worth it
good customer service and i love their water
chyna welcomed me and expertly spoke about options i had to cope with some of the issues i have been having with my frizzy split end full head of dried out unruly hair
my barber for the past 6 years retired
will be looking elsewhere
i bought a brooch which i would not have if i had not gone to the spa
i also enjoy the hot towel service at the end of the massage
however they stated that after they talk to their employee they would contact me immediately
came here based on the great yelp reviews
overall very unhappy with the experience here
its not treatable via chiroprator so i am proceeding with my treatment elsehwere
i actually got a really bad neck sprain once from sitting on their hair wash chair too long
was half the price for brazilian really good quality hair  even with my pro discount at sally  i needed hair extensions
my boyfriend went to peace of eden and bought me a 75 gift certificate as a present
this is a well kept modern decorated hotel
i felt attitude from two of the employees that were assisting me and again felt pressured to get something i was not interested in even after explaining why i was not interested
we ended up with a reasonable rate about 125girl over a 3day weekend valentines day and presidents day for a 1 bedroom and adjoining studio in tower 3  the rooms were amply furnished with enough space in the one bedroom to pull eight chairs around the glass table for card games and have the queensized couch bed open
thing i dont like about the m 1 they use to have self service soft drink stations  that is no longer
its like going to mcdonalds and being told that this particular restaurant doesnt sell big macs after adding a second floor
it took me this long time to post a review because i was so happy of my hair cut and i totally forgot it   my hair stylist was bao and he took his time to choose a color and listened what kind of heir style i want
ive never been here before but its in a common shopping area for me close to my house
ive been to some of the most expensive and most well known places here in town but ive finally found my place to go for hair cuts and styling
steggs at red rock casino  hotel
i had my first procedure yesterday with absolutely no bruising or side effects
the shower was great good pressure and as warm as i wanted it to be
i love my lashes
a 40 dollar day pass will get you full access all day long to the whole spa and to the gym
i asked that he cut the back a little shorter than the front so i could avoid having to put a ton of product in my hair every day so the back would stay down
ulta is where you go if you dont have the time or patience to run to sephora and are not partial to online shopping
i think her name began with an s she was around 52 with long dark brown hair
never ever going back
the massage function on my chair didnt work  and even though i pointed out my callused areas they werent paid much attention and ill have to tackle them myself
i could just be there forever no matter how wrinkled i get
after many hair salons i decided to try the salon at south point
we suggested a room to change in and then move into our room later
i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure
in fact 12 is a steal for this threading experience
at this point im told i can only get store credit because i dont have the original receipt lmao at this point
you cant beat 50 for a full face of makeup
but please take this as your warning that if you like natural or notrazor thin brows this is not the place for you
i usually feel rushed inandout of salons when i get my brows done but leanne actually carried on a conversation with me and took her time getting my brows just right
we went in about 1215 and were out by 130 i got a sns full set and my daughter got gel polish on fingers and toes with a design on both
dont waste your money here
not to mention he is a fun guy  chats away with you making time fly by
i have stayed at hotel valley ho for five years running every march
everyone knows there are tons of japanese salons in states or van but no japanese in torontoi have to say this place was awesome
april is great
i never went here but i just want yall to know that the price they send you is different vs when you call or what they send you is incorrect
she even brought out the ipad to look at colours so we knew exactly what the end product would be
so now we wait and see whether all my little cells cooperate and are inspired by the stem cell serum
yes calls are sometimes not returned promptly
had to wait about 10 minutes
i go see abby for my cut and any color i do
i have been wearing protective styles for a while now and wanted to change into protective style braids
she then explained to me things i never really knew
my friend and i were planning to get a couples massage here but the scheduling did not work out so we had to cancel
he is awesome
he saved me money from from the outset with what other salons were charging telling me i required two and three step color processes that i learned were not necessary plus hard on your hair
i miss you lauren
just weird to have a health and beauty business with an arcade candy machine in it as the first thing you see when you step inside the door
recently they moved to a beautiful new facility in the ritz carleton hotel which has taken their service to a whole new level
i went elsewhere to have the remainder of them removed and to get them redone i was interested to see if this was my fault if it just didnt work with my eyelashes
oh well i guess i know in the future that reservations are required
also purchased two products
and after asking 5x without him really comprehending what i was sayingi gave up
they also have a wide range of mommy massages and facials
i would recommend it to any one that needs a great hair cut or color
internet is very fast and there are enough outlets
what can i say
i couldnt be more happy and i will keep recommending this salon and stylist to my friends
one thing i still dont like about dolce is how much i feel like they push products on you
from demonstrating how the tanks function to suggesting tips for comfortable floating i felt at ease during what could have easily been an intimidating first experience
i have been perplexed as to why los angeles foot massages are so cheap compared to las vegas
it lasted a good 45minutes
she is so great
so its a good place to go and if you do i recommend that you find someone and stick to them because the staff is not equally skilled
two weeks after im  still not happy or convinced and definitely dont think i got what i paid for or what was discussed and agreed to
the therapist really concentrated on my personal needs
its 96 degrees outside  our hotel room is just as hot
i said no way are you going any further and i got up paid for the pedicure and left
i had a coupon from a while ago no expiration date but they wouldnt honor it since it was given to me from a different store owner and since they now own it they wont accept it
there are often coupons that make the cost of a haircut unbeatable
not a bad looking pedicure but i probably wont be coming here for my next one
its not often checking into a vegas hotel nets the best customer service experience of your life is it
i would love to speak to the owner but im sure that will never happen
well worth the drive
im a newbie
did i mention she also have me a wonderful head and neck massage while the masks set
i had the massage first and i found it to be ok but not the best massage ive ever had
she has been in the business for a long time and goes the extra mile in making sure youre comfortable and nummed up so the procedure is as painless as it possibly can be
if she had mentioned it could get in the way or at the very least mentioned she had gotten it all over my jewelry i may not have been as frustrated however she didnt mention a thing and i now must replace it because its completely ruined
i walk in and explain that i would like to see if i could get this fixed
i didnt have to wait long at all considering it was a walkin during lunch time
it was not until after i left that i became dissatisfied with the quality of my manicure
i love there jewelry as well
she was totally cool on time and professional
shes knowledgeable professional considerate and honest
ive also had really great service with helping me navigate everything that they have
it  was a basic foot chair
i have never had this happen before
the spa facilities here are excellent as good as it gets for sure
also if you recall i sat down with her at approx 315 and i was out of there by 330 whow worlds quickest luxury salon experienced i have ever encountered
she just told me to wait again
it was just too many holes too close to one another
my class size was 9 total
ive booked online before and havent had any problems other than once or twice being called and asked to come in at a slightly different time than what i booked for
he didnt try to upsale me on product i didnt need and made the procedure quick and easy
wow lisa is amazing
i wish all doctors took the time to explain and comfort patients
good price and ok service
20 breakfast after tip a little spendy even for vegas
candice was very friendly and asked multiple times throughout the process which took about 2 and a half hours from 4 to 730 if i was doing alright and was as comfortable as can be
i enjoyed my first experience but the prices of the products are on the expensive side
we should have just ordered one item there was so much food
i will definitely be back and glad i found a place i feel comfortable and know will receive outstanding service
id appreciate it more if she just put me in the dryer first and then worked back and forth between me and the next customer instead of getting mine rushed and the next customer wait forever
their frontoffice staff is polite and friendly and they have a range of skilled therapists specializing in different techniques and pressure levels
unprofessional and rude experience
my hairdresser was very nice and made good conversation
i have used her 3 times bridesmaids in my comadres wedding my bachelorette party and my wedding and they certainly wont be the last
today was my second time to diamond nails on s rainbow
i love this place
its nothing special for a pedicure but they also didnt do a crappy job which sometimes can happen when you pick a random place
this place is something we need in this side of town
i was so disappointed because i figured they werent telling me something and just stopped going all together and starting doing my brows myself and it aint pretty
then they switched from paper based reward system to computer good and they asked me for my cards to put on the computer last time i was in good but then none of my six stars made it to the online system
just amazing customer service
i got a brazilian wax and it was my first time but i had a great experience
still waiting for the nail fix and ive been here 2 hours
used to be a good place to be pampered and receive good quality mani pedi eyebrow wax etc but it has changed
let all potential numbers readmen know that a great way to treat a girlworship her bodimpress her friends and mothermake her feel special is to do that
she is the assistant manager and she explained the whole credit card policy when i asked about it
i wouldnt regularly see them for my waxing but ti is good in a pinch
ive been here maybe 4 times and i actually stopped mid massage this time
from the moment i walked in thuy made me feel very welcomed and comfortable
i love the personal greeting each of the stylists give when you enter the salon
but they look presentable and its tear free so we will keep returning to sharkeys
try my girl d she is booked atleast a week out but im on my 1st full set and 2nd fill and have not broken a nail and these babies are long and coffin shaped
ive never been happier with a cut in my life
he was so thorough with my haircut and paid attention to every detail
my daughter and i had a massage facial and pedicure today at expertise and each service was amazing
hello all as per all the reviews read my expectations was high when i went to this parlour
she shapes them better than i can do myself
he is eloquent on many topics wine sports restaurants and life in general
they dont push you to buy products either
i was literally like a kid in a candy store
i went here last month to celebrate my birthday and my friends birthday
this is one of the best locations i have been to
i have been 4 years in las vegas trying to find some one that makes my hight lights the way i like them
it looks like a shitty ghetto fix up
nice place to relax after enjoying all vegas has to offer
staff they are very friendly and patient
there were some regulars that stopped in while i was there
shes always on time and takes pride in her shop and profession
on the day of the scheduled appointment spacey barely acknowledged my friend as she walked through the door
they have many loyal clients
lots of amenities like a hotel but this is high rise condo living
she does great full all over color great blowdrys and straightening great with bangs etc
this place has a relaxing beach vibe to it
although vdara does not offer a wave pool  and lazy river like mandalay what it offers is equally as appealing
theyre so ugly
she became extremely upset and demand i give her my iphone until i returned
he worked really hard on my back and was a pleasure to be around for 90 minutes
staff is always friendly and although usually busy you never have to wait long if at all
i still prefer my home salon but dolce is a great alternative
i trust him and his advice
20 years going to mr tepe
i love to come here
quick and beautiful
first time getting my hair dyed at a salon and it was a success
great ownerskim and vincentalways friendly
and i waited
also they do have a pool which is pretty shallow and a hot tub which was awesome
its a great salon
johnny vegas is the only choice in my opinion
the first time was a couple three years ago
i went there on a monday afternoon and there were maybe 4 other people using the spa
it is a good time to be a small business owner
well the mgm signature manager told us they had to downgrade us to a junior suite but that they would take 110 off of the tab  night as well as 150 credit for roomservice
i understand that a small amount under the nails can be normal but every nail had a huge wad of acrylic under that i had to then remove
the stylist was very sweet explained the product to me and what colorbrand she uses and how what effects it has on your hair and made me feel better about my messed up hair
i sat there and waited while he tried every key he had on him at the time then i had to wait while he went to grab another set of keys and tried to get all of them to work
if youre considering a tattoo and can afford to wait a couple months for the first opening then id highly recommend them
when we got here the place was very quiet and not alot of people were eating
husband and i got ring tattoos here as walk ins and they gave us exactly what we wanted even though other shops in the area told us names on fingers were impossible to do nicely
i told him i dont know what to do with my hair that all i did for years at my barber was just sit and he did the rest
such a nice  sweet lady
everyone loved my hair
thank you so much
oh and by the way manager of the warehouse
my usual place is ocean reflexology
alex the owner took me under her wing after i was in desperate need of extension removal followed by a color and cut
you are fully clothed and they use excellent pressure
3 die beratung  wie soll ich schneiden
we brought our two french bulldogs with us and were treated so wonderfully by all of the staff
note  if you pay in cash no taxes
what i really love about this spa are the amenities
this happened at least 3 times
stephanie was an amazing massage therapist and she knew when to apply more or less pressure
burgers had very little flavor i got the smokey bbq burger and the brisket was good but burger was just ok and cooked well done when i asked for medium food came out really quick it didnt seem very hot or fresh
will definitely return
she provided me with excellent service and the whole atmosphere is stellar
im so pissed
approaches man to my right you want a drink or what
its taken me a while to decide whether to post my experience or not
this is my goto place
saved my friend from dying good for laughs as well
unfortunately i did not care for the high pressure sales tactics of the business
the first time i saw her new home salon i was blown away
they offer a selection of products that you wont find in many shops across the valley
i had absolutley no eyebrows due to overplucking
i asked to speak to the manager who said all that he could do was waive the 25 resort fee
he blow dryed it straight and that was that
ive found this location is just as equal in their services than the one thats in hendo so whether youre on the west or in henderson diva beauty is your first stop to go for great service with threading
jackie starr truly is a master barber
40 nets you a cut wash condition facial and scalp massage and your hands waxed
sweet view of the bellagio fountain show
i will not return to moriahs
an awesome playground to really evaluate your fitness in a fun way
ive just had my second hydrotherapy treatment with monica and am feeling supported and very well cared for
he is good with the clippers and the scissors too
erica is an amazing manicurist
if youre modest you might not like the distances between the hooks and the pools in some areas
i am sure glad i found this place
i dont think my nail stylist understood that my fingers are attached to my body and as such have pain receptors
i book the 90min35 massage
service is great here
it is a little pricey but so worth it
when i went back to go get them fixed after chipping the staff was rude and it seemed they were talking bad about me
i would give them another star if it didnt have to wait a half hour and if the prices were a tad cheaper
since when is one layer of polish ok
he also informed me that the more product placed the more risk i would be to have side effects eg
she really took her time to make my hair look so gorgeous
they truly want you to have a great experience
she gave me a great flat top
a lot of nail salons engage in these types of wax practices and its absolutely unacceptable
after seeing laser med solutions on sonoran living live i thought  i would give them a try
i have been going to kippthebarber for a few years now and have never been disappointed
i was visiting a girlfriend in the area and we decided to try this salon out for a mini girls day out
i was scared about who was going to wax me i wanted it to be molly or trish since ive read such great things about them here on yelp
the trappings are not quite truefitt and some of the extras aremissing but the cut and service were great
so overall i think this place is well worth 52
honestly this is the first time ive ever left a salon and felt that my hair had looked and felt better when i came in
the address is still listed incorrectly
id rather drive over to nordys rack and get the same jeans for half the price and half the attitude
having bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction is a tough decision but it was the right one and dr andres was the right surgeon
2 toliet paperbath tissue was surprisingly rough
she was very personable and she did a great job with the waxing
then when i got home i noticed that the waxing on my legs was poorly done as well as i had patches of hair still left over that i had to fix myself
it has its own parking lot downtown which is excellent
but after an hour with tanya sursug rmt i felt renewed revivified and absolutely ready to enjoy life
it had been less than 24 hours needless to say i did not return because at that point it was pointless
its centrally located but was smaller inside than expected considering its international status on the website
my treatments ended in october of last year and i am still fighting with my health care provider from the claims of lifequest
spot on perfect
ive run out of yelp comment space
and the price is good
great service experience and price
i told her this was ridiculous as no one had called to me tell me in advance i had driven 30 minutes to get there and that jenn had already cancelled our last appointment
to a novice in pedicure like me
they were amazing
i was worried with all of the work melissa did on my hair id get to the front and find i owed 250 which has happened to me at other salons but the price was very reasonable and i even got a 10 discount for being a new customer i didnt even have to ask for it
my appointment was for 545 pm
we had the 2 bedroom kingking suite
the lady who did my nails was not friendly and actually kind of rude
im also shaky and sick because of my meds and at one point my nail touched the side of the uv dryer and boy was that an inconvenience
still in the process suite freaking amazing
the shop itself is nice relaxed and clean and theres flash art to chose from if you want a small souvenir on your body to commemorate the trip
she kept me at ease and was a joy to spend 2 hours with which is a huge bonus
i was able to save 10 on the buffet and allowed me to get a bottle wine for 10 with my dinner
i have used just about all of the services available
i can handle the crooked nail and her me asking me the same question but the fact she tried to charge me more thinking i wouldnt notice is why i wont go back
this changed my mind on that
the groupon offers really allowed me to try this place out
we can only go on sundays because of our work schedules
the chimineas are a nice touch and made for a cozy experience on a chilly night
was extremely rushed there were a few spots she missed and didnt thoroughly go through and trim everything
call and ask for brookeyou wont be disappointed
also the filing was very aggressive as the tips and edges of the tips of my fingers are still quite tender and sore
but because of the rude behavior and my honest review that was flagged i will take my hard earned money elsewhere
and meticulous with the nails
high quality tattoos ask for ryan d he has been tattooing for 20 years and has an inspiring sense of humility
koryn cut my hair and she is awesome
heres the clincher it took this obviously new nail tech 45 min to do a very simple manicure
for some of you well you will keep this place a secret others will share it
thats basically it
amazing gym very big everything you need huge pool area staff feels a little car dealerish but are very nice but overall amazing place for under 60 a month way worth it
will definitely recommend to others
tatum was cutting the other stylists hair
my first visit i was a bit nervous jolli makes your feel comfortable
yea you can go here
distressing that the gal working on my toes in diamond bar had to do so much work to make my toes look nice
the staff is very friendly and seem to actually take the extra timeeffort to thoroughly sanitize the beds correctly
bridget is fabulous
i would definitely go back again and plan to
ich bin schon seit anfang an bei der haarbotschaft gast und muss sagen das ich immer wieder von euch begeistert bin
something just did not seemed right
i only ever use opi and it is pretty clear to me that they must be doing something to doctor the polish at this salonlike putting some additive into the bottles
you also get a 10 minute neck rub after your pedicure
she has definitely made a name for her company and i would go back if i wasnt strapped for cash
we are definitely going back
with an office located close to home i scheduled a consultation
ive been tanning at the gym and its been just a waste of time
not only that there was a miscommunication made when i booked an appointment right before i fly out of town to go home for my birthday and i had emailed them and she was at the spa within 10 minutes to help take care of me seriously amazing calm awesome patient customer service and i actually feel pretty again
from a classy to trendy style he will nail it
we are already planning to return to the hermosa inn for a longer romantic getaway
my sister and i walked in for our first time as we were on vacation and they got us in right away
the prices werent horrible 30 for a 30 minute full body massage and that is the last good thing i can say about my experience here
ive had the pleasure of being jessicas client for about three years now
taija was very polite patient and most definitely talented as a tattoo artist
love this place
probably one of the best stylist out there
they take the time to make sure you are satisfied with your eyebrows
its so vibrant and beautiful
very sweet and very professional
very happy customer
he took me in there drew the line on my belly after literally measuring with some sort of ruler thing
he cut it first when it was wet blow dried it and then continued to cut dry until he was satisfied with the shape
this was my first time with her and definitely not my last
the attention to detail is great and i never feel rushed out of his chair
its conveniently placed next to a restaurant and a shopping center
its not expensive its reasonably comparable to other salons who provide gel manicures
we opted for a couples therapeutic massage and were both very pleased with our therapists
i am reallllly particular when it comes to getting my nails did
i have been to this place before maybe a year or two ago when there was different ladies they were nice and informative so i thought id go again
so  a blow dry usually takes my stylist at vidal sasoon or toni  guy 45 mis 1hr this took about 20 mins from start to finish and my husband actually laughed when he came to meet me
they offered us drinks while we got our nails done
nathan took his time
upscale inviting  a very accommodating hotelcasino in green valley ranch  henderson nv
i definitely plan on going back and i want to check out the spa portion of the salon
the two technicians were very pleasant and tried for what they had to work with
atmosphere one girl actually working i had to wait despite two other workers one being the owner sitting at the end of the tables doing each others nails
for a family this is great all of the rooms are suites so you have a kitchen area living room and bedroom
i could have done better on my own
ok im a fan
however the people in the locker room were very friendly and willing to show us around
i mean this salon location is newer but pauls work is amazing
then they wash your hair and give you a scalp massage
she highlighted my hair perfectly and it even feels softer than when i went in
the lady whose name i dont know globbed on the acrylic my nails are thick there is dried acrylic all over my fingers the polish is chunky
she looked scared and said i cant do it for you kevin will do it
the process was painful as expected but he distracted me with jokes the entire time which was really helpful
my nails are amazing
in fact id call myself a mac snob meaning i only use mac products if i can help it
she makes you feel comfortable and does great work on your lashes
this place is a hidden gem
one thing i suggest is if you need to use the restroom use it before cause it can take 12 hours
i needed some money and i happened to droveby and saw a chase logo inside the store went in and got my money
great omeltte though
i always leave her chair feeling like a million bucks
overall terrible service from kim but amazing service from sonny
i had found him a few years back through a living social deal when he was at another salon
while i was there it was slow monday after noon but they had a few customers
they are maintaining a higher standard of cleanliness
the first time i come holly did my nails amazing she was fast and efficient and i knew i found my new nail tech
within a couple of weeks of the last salon experience i was searching yelp for another salon to try when i came across hair zzaplons reviews website etc
so we waited
appreciate so very much
only great things to say
so ive decided to go back to waxing
i just wish they had a quiet room to sit in to relax before your massage instead of just sitting out in the lobby area
what a remarkable place
i gave 2 stars because she did fantastic on my toenail design and they got me in quick
my skin is so soft and feet feel so rejuvenated
so because cyndi messed up i had to get it cut twice
the place itself clean and beautiful the stuff is friendly and the prices worth it
no its not the freaking mandalay bay but definitely more than nice for the price point
i decided for such an important event saving 50 when the pictures of the work and the reviews were so much better it just wasnt worth the risk
i have only been to this location one other time but ill be going back later today
the only place that i have seen more boxes is at the corona cigar shops in orlando
its beautifully decorated and very clean
but after my last haircut im going to suck it up and make the 45 minute drive back to my old stylist in peters township
the girl was terrified to take off the length i wanted so after 2 attempts to get her to take it shorter i walked out with a cut i was only somewhat satisfied with
tonya was rude to me as well
so right off i was disappointed
i like the light brown son much
this amazing woman invents things out of her hat with the most profound creativity
used a groupon to get my top and lower lids lined
the family leila her husband and daughter talked in another language it seemed like in a negative way about me
because of the way she was speaking to me i felt uncomfortable staying there so i took my feet out of the water and said id go elsewhere
he was also not yet crawling at 11 months
i couldnt be happier with the work which is almost finished
tessa did so great on my platinum blonde hair i will def be back
both times he directed me to exactly what i was looking for and did not try to upsale me at all
there are also cute boutique clothes for purchase at a great price
wanted to speak to the manger about my reservation and they wouldnt even allow me to
the wash bowl was so comfortable
i think it might be worth it to start buying and bringing my own bottles
terrible hair cut
i am so happy with the way she did my hair
there is a tv so i am always entertained
welcoming and also doesnt make you feel uncomfortable
for that i was charged 95 plus another generous tip from me of 20
didnt smile didnt tell me to have a nice day nothing
customer service is tops on their list
her blowout is flawless and last a few days
she chooses the right size and shape for you and wont go pass a certain length that is unnatural looking for you
so instead of running a quick errand and heading to the airport i had to hurry home and drystyle my hair
my girlfriend wanted to get her hair done so we made an appointment here at globe salon
earth was the best part
i prefer my nails to be cut with actual nail cutters and not cuticle cutters
my husband purchased a groupon for 2 massages and gave it to me for my birthday
the only time she was remotely pleasant was at the end maybe to get me to give a good tip or something and to try to sell me a bunch of products
im so glad he was because all of my neck and back pain has vanished im not exaggerating
a hidden gem
he didnt go into detail his short response was that he does not remove fat from the upper eyelid
i was so happy with my experience that i already scheduled my next appointment
she also did my aunts eyebrows she was a threading virgin and they looked fantastic
the lady who massages here is rude and does not know anything about reflexology
my aunt took me to reve a few months ago for a mini shellac pedi
i had my haircut with manny and he is friendly and experienced in the trade
other than the wait they were great
rebecca offers discounts with a series of treatments
she has great energy and loves what she does and it totally shows in the care she puts in when your in the chair
back in kc the only person who ever cut my hair was my mom so needless to say i was a little worried about finding a place to get my haircut
lets get down to business the lady that was doing my pedicure lord be with her
i told him no someone confirmed it was cancelled
its a nice spa
it isnt super fancy it isnt like a high end casino spa
in just over an hour i had a wonderful shampoo my favorite part
i think they will lower the cost to the spa and gym because none of us in our group used it and when we got a free tour of the place to see what it looked like it was empty
im very happy with this doctor
sorry if i was snoring
pedicures are great and relaxing
ive been to multiple barbers here in the valley and can confidently say jacob is best ive had
we will be taking our business elsewhere and are really bummed
thank you so much sonny
there isnt a casino in the hotel itself however you can go to the aria mandarin or the cosmo all within city center if you want to play
i love that its open on sundays as most nails salons in the area are closed
i thought that was awesome cause it showed professionalism and seemed like the perfect place to get something done
looking for a flawless longlasting thorough pedicure that leaves your feet perfectly soft and perfectly pampered
monica can do any nail design that you want from simple to interact
i had to tell myself dont go to jail for this one
they were booked and couldnt get me in that day
i am not going to say much since i have never used any of the other services
after exchanging emails with the salon manager for over a week i finally asked for the owner to contact me
this spa is absolutely amazing and an original facility
i do wonder what everyone else does to avoid wrecking the nail job in the first hours while it properly dries
me and my daughter have been to other salons and this one is still the best
i had never had my haircut in cleveland before and i lucked out big time when i found dimanti
the bigger room consisted of a bedroom a living room and one and a half bathrooms and the smaller room combined bedroom and living with only one bathroom
he was rude inconsiderate and not caring
avoid the guy that i am referring to he really doesnt know what hes doing
she is completely fantastic
id definitely go back
i cant even find them on google
4 sarah is an artist at heart
theyre all awesome
both tammy and ko know what theyre doing
i call it needle torture but its not bad at all and its worth it when youre sick of breaking out
i dont know alot about it but the place was very clean and nice and friendly vibe and my girlfriend told me they did very good job on her nails and she will always go there
i get a better job done by the little traditional nail shop by bashas on dobson
its amazing what a good cut can do for you
clean big awesome chairs super staff and awesome service
elliott did a great job and the times when i have had to bring my daughter in they have always been welcoming
she spotted the fact that my last few brow adventures at a midexpensive spa had left me with the wrong shape for my face and uneven arches
i love htc the staff and their jewelry selection
first time i went there i wanted to make a dramatic change to my hair and decided to get a bob with senior stylist jason
i wrote and thought i posted a review several weeks ago and since i have not seen it i am forced to write a new one and am disappointed that i currently cannot remember her name
avoid hair removal and any other services they provide because they will take your money and you will not see results
note this location has moved to the strip across from mandalay bay casino and resort
now my appointment became uncomfortable and awkward since she had a huge attuide due to my questions
i love their collection of women and men fragrances they have everything i need as far as cosmetics
clean walkin friendly and open on sundays
fyi though if you want someplace thats posh prissy quiet blackandwhite polished and completely full of itself this place is not for you
i guess just a good cut but theyve got that covered
with andys the original hot stone reflexology place closing down the crowd migrated here
worst cut ever  i was on the edge of my chair cause had now been at salon almost 225 hours when told color and cut could be in and out in an hour and when i pointed out that she had missed some of the roots misty started getting even more snippy with me making comments like well if you were not in such a hurry i could dry your hair and i could put more color on but you keep saying you have to go
i didnt get the type of manicure and polish i asked for
i love the way she cuts my hair the layers always fall so beautifully
my 1st attempt i came during the week around 3pm to purchase a gift card and no one in the place knew how to issue a gift card and told me to come back the next day after 9amwell i work during those hours so i cant just come back when some in the establishment knows how to issue a gift card
if you are getting a pedicure all of the technicians do an awesome job
i highly recommend heather shes the best
though because hes usually booked
i also paid an additional fee for eyelashes that were also ripped off right away
he did exactly what i asked for even explained why i shouldnt get it on one part of my body cause it would tend to fade more which was nice of him to suggest
this salon was recommended to me by a friend
id like to note that when i thread my chin the ladies leave dozens of cuts on my chin due to their improper threading techniques but that is a whole other issue
the last two times i have come to this store they have been out of several products i needed
so pick up your prescription before or after thursday unless you like the night club feel
they asked if she had an appointment she said she didnt
secondly they didnt care if i had not been there that their offer stands if i favorably review their business then they would issue me a onetime free certificate to try their spa
ill admit that
she knows her stuff
so happy i had ashley there with me during my labor with my baby girl back in december
lori is the best stylist ever
place gets a single star since i cant select zero
i felt like an idiot sitting in the chair
i have to tell you though jody is really amazing
at teres they offer a dry manicure
her product smells amazing and looks so natural it fades very naturally as well
since the nail salon had such affordable prices i was sure to leave a tip
best gel nails i have had done in phoenix and i have been to way too many places
i was amazed at the amount of shushing for the quiet conversations we were having
brittney continues to deliver amazing results with gentle yet effective products and techniques
all the machines are open and its the right energy to get in a great workout
erin puts her customers first and is extremely flexible in getting appointments in
ofcourse they didnt have an answer to my question
sophia was great
close to tempe and mesa
i found a great stylist at lust
ive read some reviews saying to try different therapists to find one that fits you
i was sitting for 15 mins seen a barber just got done cutting a clients hair and went straight to his meal
my boyfriend loved his massage
that was my first time and i will be back
the staff was a pleasure to work with
the owner of the salon called me regarding my review apparently she went back to the appt
i refuse to go any where else
very professional friendly and excellent at sugaring
i have been going to this salon since it opened
this place rocks
they are extremely well educated with their knowledge on hair care
after all the yelp reviews mentioning juice boxes i was fully expecting one but the wait time was so short
i got my shellac french mani done today by xiu chen and i am in love
it must be the hand massage and hot towel after my hair is washed that did it for me
my daughter wanted purple hair for her quinceaera and thats exactly what she got
could you imagine if we hadnt tested a piece first and i did my whole head like that
good relaxing vibe upon entry
i was so thrilled by their reaction  it was a huge boost to my selfesteem and i am ever so grateful to have abbys services
i made an appointment requesting scott based on reviews however scott was not there when i arrived i became a bit skeptical
friendly ladies who take their time and make sure every nail looks great
do you think she went to find her
give these guys a call ahead of time to get a massage
exclusive access to property to ensure privacy and safety
i went home  wrote another email to the manager that was on vacation
my only iffy is that they are roughly 20 miles away from the strip and their shuttle services are a bit lacking they only come every 2 hours and dont match the flight times nicely
it was as if everything i told her to do she did the opposite
there we were 725 and she proceeds to do a full on french manicure for nearly 40 minutes
in the immortal words of liz lemon blerg
also cant imagine chopping a sweaty dudes barnet
great local business great owners great space great classes
she really listens to what i want and works like an artist
simply the best massage ive ever had
this make three times that ive tried to work with location
it looks sloppy
but there isnt anyone who compares to the level of service  knowledge that she has in my opinion
dont waste your money here
i will definitely be back and will be recommending this shop to everyone i know
they werent that busy and told me to sit down in the pedicure chair
i wanted to give an update on my fusion hair extensions that perla put in over 4 months ago
she is calming and gentle
not only is georgina a very talented person she is an amazing caring and funny person
just received a french manicure and it was the worst one i have ever gotten
the staff do wonderful work and are so friendly
if youre looking for a great las vegas barber you really dont have to look any further than this place
i havent had color this good in a very long time
i love that you can see and read all of the results instead of just hearing your tests were normalabnormal from the doctors
thank you ladies i will only get my hair done here from now on
the manipedi services i received from crystal was great and she alone deserves 4 stars
i was among this nail salons first customers when it opened in monticello almost five years ago
they made me call priceline to fax over the confirmation even though i showed them my email confirmation
the staff is great and every thing works
rachel is my current favorite stylist
the rock shrimp was pretty standard you can get this dish a lot of places
when the massage was first booked they messed up and they called back to fix the mix up they accidently put one of us under a facialist instead of a masseuse
days later i asked if i had an appointment on the day that was discussed  you guessed it
had the right designs but the artist only did large designs
you must follow protocol when you first get them on
wherever sandra is i go because not only is she best nail tech shes a funny person who always makes my time there worthwhile
i love this salon
sadly i wont be coming back
the waitress was also very nice
this girl up front really has to get it together she is completely clueless
apple cider vinaigrette dressing was awesome
lyndsie who did my hair was great
ive lived in vegas for 7 years and always had difficulty finding a good nail tech
conversation was great
every time i come to this store i am truly amazed by the customer service
bad cut ive had much better i literally went home and added the layers that were missing in my hair by myself looks ten times better
he made sure my little one was taken care of as well as myself
there are lots of choices in scottsdale
war zufrieden heute
definitely go see yolanda if you want those long luscious lashes
thank you for being so close and convenient
i recently had a facial by amy and it was wonderful
granted ive gone to salons is scottsdale that were far more expensive but my budget in college was far more expendable than it is now
on top of that their productss organic from the scented scrubs to their polishes
and if it does come to you theyre probably packed with people already so you have to wait for the next oneor the next oneor the next one
anyhow i purchased a groupon for the angel lashes for 29 good deal right
plus everyone else is super nice and welcoming here
the store has regular sales and promotions and the pricing of the products are very reasonable compared to skin care products sold at the department stores
he immediately understands the rather insensitive korean language jokes of the nail technicians that are poking fun at elaine and makes a big scene in the store demanding they apologize to him and to elaine
i got a mani and pedi and wanted gel but got regular nail polish
i recommend  that she ask her clients if they are pleased with the results of her service before she leaves the room and tells them to get dressed
i was visiting vegas and decided to get a tattoo
i hope my experience was a one off
skinfit is amazing
good news is morgan doesnt work there anymore bad news they way underquote wait times
this was a few weeks ago and my hair still feels amazing despite having had my hair bleached through for almost 7 hours
its easy to find on south blvd look for the orange houses and the signs
theres three chairs that arent reflexology chairs with ottomans
i was charged for a glitter that i didnt even want and my gel nail polish chipped the next morning
i brought some pictures and explained the haircut i wanted
alayna cut my husbands hair very well he has thick wavy hair and she cut and styled it so that he still had body and texture but not so short he looked like he was 12 unfortunately this is how a lot of hairdressers in the past have cut it
staff is nice and very friendly
it is a beautiful full service spa fully equipped with jacuzzis steam rooms saunas showers  apparently there are a few different showers one of which is a cascading waterfall all of these amenities are separate from the treatment rooms
i needed someone experienced
as with most mac counters ive been to the staff tends to be aloof when you walk in and attempt to correct their attitude when you decide to buy something
i signed up for a vip membership for a few months 75 per month and i had to leave the country so i had them cancel it
it is like a paradise in the desert
linda was great
i experienced a wonderfully soothing and healing 55minute relaxation massage from neny who added in some muchneeded reflexology to my hands and feet
not that long of a procedure
we were happy when we left there on thursday but the actions today left me gravely disappointed in this local business
they are very friendly and nicely priced
with the rate i got from wwwhotelscom it was definitely worth it
we always leave happy
he was so informative and gave me options and suggestions
so ill start with the basics
have had several tattoos done at staytrue by jason murphy
all in all kind of a shame because the medical staff is always very nice and helpful
walked in my house and my wifes all like dayyyyyyyuuuuuum boy you look gooooooooood
however that was not the case this time
every time i have gone in the same employees are there and i think they are all great
this young woman the only one thereyou could tell she wasnt confident with her hands
my brows look wonderful
jill and dora did amazing work on us 3 bridesmaids
everyone at work keeps asking me what i am doing for my skin
then he tried to tell me to just get a gel color this time
i really wanted to like this place and the service and the owner was a nice person and easy to talk tobut its wasnt even worth the 50 plus a tip based on 375 which i did in good faith only to regret it  later
the heavier man had a client when we walked in and was cracking jokes and making small talk with the customer
anna our server came promptly to take our order and we were served our tea and pastries within 5 minutes
would and will recommend her to everyone i know
they have the best services and always stay on top of the trends with top results
i didnt want to wait around for the facial and was quite irritated by how i was treated by the manager
my results turned out better than expected and my recovery was smoother than expected
she was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable during the appointment
its been years now since my surgery and every day i think of dr minoli and the dramatic impact he has made on my life
anyway i was greeted and sat down by and with a gentleman who didnt want to give me his name
apparently someone else needed that room because there was a machine that they needed to use
clean friendly and reasonably priced
but you can walkin and they should be able to fit you in if not then really its worth coming back at whatever time they say
i found my new regular place
excellent service and id highly recommend you go here for your waxing needs
they offer you a sofa or water when you walk in and very affordable compared to these barbers in las vegas
she said he will be right over and he wasnt happy
did not like being asked for my key every time i went up the elevator
ben was great at that
felt i had to climb uphill to cuddle w my husband
i have a very bad cowlick that is challenging to cut
i was recommended by a friend who said it was amazing and i couldnt agree more
whats not to love
she has been cutting and coloring my hair now for almost a year and i am always pleased
i absoluuutely adore this place and the people here
super chill and relaxed shop with some amazing talent
i felt at home
love this place
then to our surprise the entertainment started at 8 pm
i have been to a lot of nail salons since moving to charlotte and the nail spa never fails to disappoint
didnt take more then 15 minutes
i am new to this area and was grateful to find a place with such nice people
i got gel at other place before it was trash
they even have cold towels scented according to the time of day which are great to put over your face in the sauna
pedicures have generally lasted a month or more
the facility was clean and had a streamlined look to it in addition to a plethora of colors of both regular and gel polishes from which to choose
i was thrilled with the groupon price but am even thinking about going back for a full price haircut
i think i paid 110 cash including tip which is kind of mind blowing considering how well they have held up
finally michael cut my hair while simultaneously working on two other clients which left the wash dry and everything else to the overworked staff
its hard to find good massages and ill definitely keep this place in mind when im in town
her husband is very good also
i had to do some of my own maintenance and trimming of longer pieces when we got home
upon checkin i was given a key to a locker that didnt work
the buffet is nice as there are different cuisines
i love cutters cottage
was looking for wocs and the sales person was really friendly to my surprise
everything here is great
his attention to detail is second to none
the only thing about the loyalty card is that it was createdmade for 60 minute massages and not 90 minute massages since a 90 minute massage only gets 1 stamp on the card
i contacted the manager and i did get an apology
bertha fixed it and now my skin is glowing
please tell me where u get your pillows
she was very nice and did a great job with my highlights
i wouldnt switch to anyone else
the most kind staff ive ever dealt with theyre super funny and do an amazing job for a really good price definitely making this my go to place from now on
it was the type of cut that you feel like a whole new man because of how clean and crisp your hair cut looks
they were thick and gunky and looked awful
my daughter and i walked in today
i did feel a little jipped on the massage portion but cant complain too much with such a great price
2 tips for urbana i am new to the whole spa experience it would be good to tell newbies how a massagefacial will go what to expect routine wise before you start like i didnt realize i would get lip gloss put on at the end of my facial which was nice
plan some extra time for it
prices are a bit lower than most other salons in the valley
i love lush
she did an ombr cut and style
im not giving you yet another card to say didnt run correctly and get double charged
i love this place
everyone at the salon is fantastic skilled friendly sweet and fast
probably the best haircut i have ever had
dont be 5 minutes late or she will cancel  drove across town and let her know i was running late
today i had a diamondabrasion session with lisa
my facial was so relaxing i actually fell asleep
i will visit her again when im back in town
i wouldnt come back because i dont like the chipping within 24 hours
i didnt get this young ladys name but i dont think i can return
i always recommend this salon over any other this is my goto place
todays visit  had lynn as a nail tech super nice and was focused on my satisfaction
when i brought it to the attention of the cashier she was less than enthused
really cool people and its our go to place for supplies
i would rather drive out to chandler where the choices and products are so much better and not old
guerlain products are some of my favorites
this is the spot
i know it is hard to find a good salon to stick with
they were nice patient and attentive
well after leaving cathy i now have my youth back and a clear face
i could have done them myself and they would have turned out better
mami has the touch of a feather and you can basically fall asleep while she works on your lashes
the facility itself was great
my hair looks wonderful from day one of the cut  great job again edwardjames scissorhands
the price was half what we normally pay for his haircut with my wifes stylist
jose offered nice advice about hair product without being a pushy salesperson
the owner continued to cash us out and when she was finished she said ok go home now
i was impressed how nice was everybody working together to solve the situation
the last visit which is the one that pushed me over the edge involved a personal hygienic issue with one of the female employees
get thee to color by numbers
after talking with dr gitt however i really felt that he understood my desires and concerns
absolutely the best haircut ive ever had
very friendly and personable technicians
her energy is contagious
in fact the facial is one of the best ive had
when i first walked in it looked more like a daycare than a salon
its worth the long long walk to the strip  ive also stayed at the venetian which also calls for a 5 star but i think the mgm has the grander pool which gives this place the edge
i am giving them 10stars
welllllll  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap sooo since i am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that i am the paying customer
the people were friendly and had great attention to detail
i could have done a much better job if i had gone to cvs and bought a box of color
the mean korean lady that should of been working and was just sitting and watching a tv like a lazy butt jumped up yelled at us again saying to not put the blow dryer on the floor we tried to explain to her that it was sparking and we didnt want it to catch on fire
the procedures does hurt a little bit but the pain fades super fast and the process is quick so if you can just relax you will get through it quickly
i have been dealing with sciatica and after each session i look forward to coming back
i just finished my first consultation and dress tryingon session at strut
the breakfast is superb
i arrived at the spa and waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes before anyone came out from the back
everythings a little messier a little older a little dirtier
they must be too cheap to put down a fresh sheet or towel between clients or to clean the chair between uses
if i return to vegas again i would definitely come back
i was told the wait would be 10 minutes
ive passed by and heard wonderful things
now theyre 50 min and they waste a ton of time refilling buckets talking to coworkers
shes been in the business for a long time and her work speaks for itself
three pools sauna steam rooms and by far the best cardio equipment of any gym i have been to
i always know im in good hands when i see nat
would suffice
the atmosphere was as relaxing as it gets and dj took his time and worked out all the knots and whatevers i had in my back
the salon is also very tastefully decorated
before moving to washington dc i lived in henderson nv for six years
i took my 13 yr old son here he has been here before too
seriously it was as if a fiveyearold was playing beauty salon on me
and said im taking a picture since you used all of my gems
teresa was caring and helped me achieve great results with lessening my brown spots and hydrating my skin
but there it was  big and blistery and disgusting
as far as im concerned an ulta is an ulta no matter where its located
they are extremely friendly and they never push you to buy products
im always leery about nail salons that are run by persons who dont speak english well but this salon surprised me as being very good although it is always rude to speak in your native tongue around clients that dont speak your language they could be calling me a bitch for all i know
shes honest fun and professional
i was not asked to do this review
after the seventh time trying to book an appointment i went in to see if i could get a refund since their hours and my work hours were the same
then there are the tattoos themselves
jaime y aller le soir aprs 18h quand cest  rabais
pro tip book your appointment online at httptownbarberca you may have to book a week in advance but theyre worth the wait
im a postsalon crier however
i was faced with the decision to either be my usual proud self and completely destroy this young ladys nerves with added pressure or i could take a deep breath remember that hair grows back and put the young stylist at ease
i chose to go with the blitz  glow facial and indeed after my facial i was glowing
dont believe bad reviews
i would recommend her to literally everyone
kim is awesome
she keeps chatting and ignores me
he was very patient with me and was clearly very knowledgeable in his field
youd think that aside from excellent customer service terrific products reasonable pricing easilyaccessible locations a sparklingclean and beautiful environment compelling social networking and fantastic promotions there would be not much left to compliment about a service organizationbut there is
after five or so years i decided to get the locks chopped off
really bad customer service
half way through my pedicure a doctors wife came in and said that she was in a hurry
the front office staff is always very professional and accommodating with appointment times
as much as i would like to have them all fixed i just dont have the funds for it
nothing too bad or too good
massages then foot scrubs followed by use of a really cool and high tech couples shower
she obviously had some where to be and it sure wasnt here cause that was not the service i came for or expected
the place also is very sanitary  which is very important in my book
he was very condescending
i was sitting on the pedicure chair for 20 minutes before i asked someone where is the guy who did my toes and they told me he left what in the world
vida is absolutely amazing
i have tanned in their versa spa four times with a 5 time pass
thank goodness we didnt get a manicure either
i was the only female there when i arrived and my fiance said there were only one or two other guys there
the barbers were nice and upbeat with good convo
the place is always busy so i recommend making an appointment
this place was so big i couldnt even find the stila counter and usually thats one of the biggest counters in sephora
i didnt see a lot of adultled activities
their prices are very reasonable the chairs are really good massage chairs and every pedi comes with a hot stone massage
i plan to join the membership  try it out for a 6 month it seems well worth it considering i usually get a massage every other month
so finding my way to the tarte section and not seeing the brush i wanted available it took me 5 minutes to find someone who looked like they were willing to help me
i thought they had finally got it right and it was so nice and relaxing
also i have a disability where my hand mobility is extremely limited
thank you mark
months later i try it again
i still cant get over how this nail salon is so expensive for a job that was poorly done
he also spent at least 5 minutes of the 60 draping me adjusting the bed moving towels around etc
i will definitely be back
this is my absolute favorite place to be and go
she is so fun to talk to during your appointment i always enjoy my little break with her every couple of weeks
im here visiting family and came to this nail place for a pedicure and gel manicure
randi ann worked on my boyfriend whos 64 and weighs 235 my boyfriend requested hard pressure and he had a few knots
in the past i have used suddenly slimmer day spa and they use the pink wax
prices are great its easy to book appointments and the haircut comes with an excellent headneck massage
the actual salon is a bit too sanitary  bright white looking it could definitely use a bit of atmosphere
coffee in morning great
i wanted to like this place i really did
she moved onto painting my toes before i could even say something
for 21  tip and with no direction on my part other than short i walk out of there with a great haircut and a neck thats been cleaned up with a straight razor
btw the deuce is not a bad choice
the problem is their standup beds both look reeeeeeally old
i thought it was going to be a relaxing time but it started with my nail technician asking me when i was due and then asking me if i was having twins what every pregnant woman wants to hear
had a cut and foil frost done by sandy
a quick note if you dont like loud children dont go there
did you know they even serve food at a makeshift cafe
stayed in june for our kids end of year celebration and i would stay here a million times over
i found summer when i was online looking for a place to get microdermabrasion
i really liked this place
i would think with as many salons as there are in scottsdale that they would do their best to accomodate their current customers
i am here visiting
i got the blended ombr and it came out flawless
i finally decided to take her advice and wait
they didnt have a great selection of nongel colors and i had a very specific color in mind
i used to go to a highend facial spa before i discovered this one
dont waste your time or money here esp when there are so many other choices in the valley
i mentioned to her i wanted to get a trim lighter color and more ashy tones since i had a lot of red tones
i looked very relaxed when i left
i think 01 always red looks great on everyone
awesome customer service
this is what we love and the reason we only make one visit to south point in the 3 weeks we are in vegas every year
this place is on durango and a little farther from my house than lovely nails but i am so glad i decided to give this place a try
i like this business because they put you at ease  make you feel relaxed  not feel embarrassed
my previous hair stylist did a horrible job on my last cut so i had a lot of uneven places and was really unhappy
i also tried chatting with my nail technician
she got me right in and answered all my questions over text and in person customer service like that is rare
i checked multiple over 7 walgreens way in advance of the may 21st red nose day and not one had any red noses left
just got married on friday and felt compelled to share my experience with amelia and bri asap
my bridal party went here for gel french manicures
i would definitely return for highlights especially if theres another yelp deal
afterall the difference between a bad haircut and a good one is supposed to be three weeks
she does excellent work and my lashes always last for way longer than one would expect
not real crowded and easy to get around and easy free parking
nothing spectacular but not bad by any means
the girl doing my nails was probably about 15 and was surly not licensed
hurry up and make your appointment you wont be disappointed
doctor  k explain you and help you get the body that you want with very clean and beautiful work
i had wanted to see my tattoo design drawn up a little differently and he said he didnt have time to redraw it then tattoo it on me
i wouldnt have came back anyways but its still the point
best haircut in a while
she took her time to draw on and pick colors till she was completely comfortable with them then the big moment came and my mom said it was a piece of cake and regretted not coming in sooner
the services are reasonable and the staff was skilled and friendly
she even had the owner amber consult with her
all in all it was a great experience
ive seen her a couple times and i always leave happy
upon my second attempt back trying to fix the mess they created the workers were not as kind to me and did not complete the drying process of my hair
anyway i decided to come here because of the reviews
poor kid looked like he had a little bowl hat on his head
glad i tried coming here cause a friend of mine suggested me to come here
pros  fitness center was nice and clean
after walk around in my shoes my toes were a little sore from the shortness and excessive removal of the cuticles
and today i got the most amaaaaaazing treatment i done ever experienced rain drop therapy holy mother of mothers
i needed to find someone else
liz is my tech and she is awesome
keep in mind its a huge property obviously with resort and conf center in the name so not in walking distance of anything
she was meticulous and knew what she was doing
this review is for the salon only
unlike other stylists my hair was in amazing shape after removing my extensions no damage at all
i had free week tanning was ready to pay for a month of unlimited level 1 sign on counter says 35
there are other great massage places in the valley that have respect for their customers
like other recent reviewers i have been coming here for years
15 haircut cant be beat
110 no artist
she introduced herself gave me some new client paperwork to complete and then we had a mini consultation on what to expect during my wax appointment
if she does your extentions ask to see them out of the tray
the music never goes out and the place seems cozy and comfortable
i feel like i have a new face when i come out
she reassured me that it would turn out the way i had wanted it
i guess the masseuses were just much better
hanna is a skilled and knowledgeable technician who wasnt afraid to push the boundaries for the best results
i love it here
hours are good and its opened 7 days a week
the massage was very surprisingly great
also their new nail tech dav is fantastic
the girls who work here are really personable and i actually trust them when asking for recommendations on lotion as opposed to previous experiences ive had before i went to sunchain where i felt like the person working was just trying to sell me on the most expensive product without listening to what i wanted in it
skyler is great
the students have all been very sweet and very good and very cautious which is good because im picky
this is a place i strongly recommend to my friends and the others to come here
marijana was quick thorough and friendly
plus when i do spray tanning ive never turned orange or streaky because they are the only tanning salon that has the newest technology in spray tanning
loved getting this done
my mom and i went here for the first time to get a pedicure
definitely pleases the eyes when you first walk in
the establishment is very clean as well which is a huge plus
if you want an impersonal customer experience with questionable cleanliness and basic service youll be fine
my wife and i took the couples yoga and massage class here last friday night and thought it was great on so many levels
she does an amazing job
i brought my sister and niece around 9pm
yet comfortable at the same time
so 175 in 2 weeks
as vegas hotels go this place is boring
fade flattop etc
russ gibson has a prime spot in the bofa plaza and he knows how to take care of everyone
ill be back
check out her ig   hairmotty
i tried flip side for the first time with my dad last week
completely at random i meet rowena and was just having a normal conversation when she told me what she does
they made me feel comfortable and dr miller was very honest about what i needed and didnt need
i brought my best friend in for her first tattoo and nick did a great job
my daughter and i started taking the de novo products about 50 days ago with amazing results
brazilian waxes can be an unpleasant thing but she is quick efficient and makes it as least painful as possible
i just got a brazilian blowout and its gorgeous
they pretty much have everything you need to get ready ie brushes blowdryers and toiletries
first of all he didnt clean up all the skincuticle area like i wanted
she had me like a new man when she was done
i have your texts still to prove im right
we all got what i believe was the deluxe pedi  mani for 55
this is the best nail salon around  i have tried several but would highly recommend relaxing nails
he found every sore muscle in my back and shoulders
i have been a spa girl for quite sometime and love the service that you get at nordstrom
she certainly handles your nails with great care
she took great care with me yet didnt go too slow
this place is terrible i had an appointment at 4 pm i was not helped until 420 pm then while removing my previous arcylic he stabbed me
i have been going to skindefined for my facial eyebrow waxing and related skin care needs for about seven years now
though ive had to learn how to wash my face properly with them on its helped me take care of my skin better because now i have a proper skincare routine
i was also appalled that they were doing waxing right behind the manicure tables for everyone to see
she then began to yell and argue with me about how im the problem then took it upon herself to chop off the nails and i asked what she was doing and shes like i am doing a new set for you even though she didnt ask me and i told her no i dont have time for that
aside from her complaining to me about how poor she is and how annoying her 16 year old daughter is she also did a horrendous job on my nails
was in last week for a mainpedi
im incredibly new to the hair coloring scene but if ive learned anything its that communication with your stylists is key
ive acquired a chronic tightness in my upper back which often leads to headaches
i love aveda so this is definitely my spot now
if you need a good cut ask for evan
mr t and i were then directed to separate locker rooms greeted by attendants and given facility tours
walked in for 1st time and was taken in 5 mins as promised topaz cut my hair and was light on conversation and pleasant she really was very conversational and did an awesome job on my hair my wife said  go back to her its the best your hair has been cut in years   guess ill be back the boss spoke lol
cheap clean awesome
she really knows hair
they offered me a cold bottle of water on arrival  much appreciated in this july heat
she charged way too much and i still have hair stubles and the burning sensation has not gone away
nails and spa appointments are always relaxing and everyone is so friendly
not only do i get my hair done and a massages but i have also tried the laser tech and the mani and pedis as well
qnail also offers higher end pedicures with sugar scrubs that i will have to try soon
love their shellac  i would go back again for sure
shes going to fix it with a simple conditioning treatment and the right cut for my hair
had my first experience at dolce borgata today and i had a lovely time
after a few tries she said she couldnt and asked if i wanted something else
this is a great salon
i have to say that this review is for kim mason who works in the salon but you do your appointments through her not the salon
my hair was growing out after a particularly bad cut ok so i shaved my head and i really needed a new cute style to make me feel pretty again
my massage was great very relaxing
i have found my hair guy
would recommend if you are looking for a really beautiful place to relax and unwind
i called and asked their hours and prices
i discovered jj hair club via a friend who has beautiful straight silky hair
now that im back in town with work i made it a point to return to this awesome facility
i came to her with a horribly short sharpedged haircut that i was worried you would be able to see it with the extensions and she blended it perfectly
you guys rock and i love you
tina and kim are superrrr nice they always remember you and know what you had done last time
my friend asked her repeatedly to stop the guy doing my other friends pedi even said something to the woman in another language and they both laughed  she didnt stop
we came to south point to see the spazmatics
this time a message from monica wanting to make things right
i went and had my nails done by deb she was pleasant and funny
they have a starbucks right there so if you need the caffeine you got it on hand
the lady kind of rushed through the whole process
being from the east coast where a manipedi is 25 the 28 pedicure was a little shock but worth the price
yelp u embarrassed me
this is the time frame when you discover all the gadgets and shiny things that  walgreens has to offer
may i recommend solar star on gilead in huntersville for great results price and service
see you in two weeks
i have even asked her to just try something new and surprise me and she has done just that with happy results
this is a good place next to the beautiful red rock canyons
what i really liked about the facial i got was that i had originally been scheduled for a more expensive treatment however when the aesthetician saw my skin she commented that it was in quite good shape and that i did not need such an extensive treatmentso not only was i getting flattered she as doing it to get me to have a cheaper treatment
i was in need of a good hair cut and color so i got on yelp and searched for a salon in the area
i have suffered with acne for a long time so i have had my fair share of facials and know what i like and dont
there was another lady who was also waiting for a 12pm appointment and said she too has had problems with this business in the past
im sad i found this salon right before i moved to atlanta but i always squeeze in an appointment when i come back to visit my mom
i end up getting multiple bills or a glitched cart that sends me multiples of the same product
im sure wherever i go will appreciate my business and money
it is way off the strip but it is a completely encompassing experiencethey have everything you need in one building
i have to keep that in mind for next time
the atmosphere is cool friendly with a mixed clientele and the sangria is very satisfying
i waited to write this review because i wanted to see how long the nails would lastand it still look amazing beside the growth of my nails
i felt their cleanliness was slightly questionable and they used the graters is that illegal here
was i really ready for this
born and raised in vegas priscilla is definitely the queen of the fade best ive seen
the ladies here are super nice and my nails always look great
the actual foot massage was ok with a hot water chinese foot bath
how can you be licensed to do nails and you cant polish
i just went in to get a nostril piercing and i was lucky enough to get scotty
very niceelegant hotel
i loved the decor
i didnt get taken back until 107 but even then i didnt get taken back by my booked stylist
went in today with my wife to get matching ring tattoos
yaya was the one who took care of the different stress knots in my back
after figuring out our luggage situation we were back in 2 days later draining our wallets and following in love
virtually everything is great here from the food to the pool to the relaxed casino
at 1055 i called them with no answer
im usually here getting my eyebrows done every week by shila
from karate to dance to rock climbing to science
the owner was very attentive the nail technicians that worked on me were very professional and gentle
so this last weekend my cut had grown out and the layers were no longer defined
i definitely recommend this place and plan on going back in the future
i was offered a hot warm towel and a very good selection of drinks
i called the manager kathy again and was so shook up about the experience that i couldnt even finish the complaint
if youre looking for a good clean place to remove unwanted hair  try this place
i did eventually get a call back from the manager at studio z offering to refund my money for the manicure  apologizingshe was obviously very sorry about it unlike the guy id spoken to in the morning
when we arrive one of the lady was just eating and the kitchen is right across one of the massage room which is kind of tacky  the ladies were trying their best but we both had hot burning towels thrown on our back super weird
ill just fix it myself
i cant remember who my stylist was for the life of me it was a malewhich i know doesnt help in the slightest
she is really accommodating as well as her assistant kimberly
since i made the appointment and they were walkins of course i would go first
as pjp states this place reminds you of the movie barbershop there were moms bringing in kids young men and old gs in the waiting area
i came in with my boyfriend  he was gonna get a pedicure  i a fullset
i just walked out
i have been a customer for few years and bety is very professional she really take care of her customers and the prices are affordable for everyone
then i receive lids
then three of the girls not me because i already hated my hair got makeup done
walking in i asked for black matte with a regular shiny black nail design on top
if your looking for quality nails that will last and look great id definitely give herbal nails a try
they have free perfume samples
i researched a bit before coming to apple nail  spa
my regular stylist brittany always does a great job with my cuts
i dont get massages often but i know i prefer firm but not deep pressure
it took me only 15 hour
you request an early check in for the reason that 12 you party took a redeye in from hawaii and arrived at 7am
nails came out perfect and they have all the jewels and supplies that most places dont
aufgrund der guten bewertungen auf qype und das tolle ergebnis einer kollegin sowie der preistransparenz auf der homepage von sabine mnch habe ich mich zum glck fr sie entschieden
i loved how my brows looked
i enjoyed working at bangz while i was there
stereotypically a man who wants to pay 50 for his hair probably wont give 2 shats about an xbox
ok so it had been a long day long drive we finally get to vegas decide on a place for dinner and thought hmmm we want massages
ok this was my third brazilian ever and by far the best
the fifthfinger team is hands down the best i highly recommend them they are worth every penny
with that said i made the notifications that i wanted to come in for a haircut for myself and my son
i love this
i will never go to another shop
ive found the perfect place at perfect 10 nails
i highly recommend the packages she does
i have been planning to have another tattoo done months and months away so when i knew we were coming to vegas for a quick break i did my research and decided to have it done at this studiofirst impression of this place that it was hip and really clean
this place is great
i washed my hands with pink grapefruit
i am definitely coming back to her for my next event
this includes a 50 minute massage
anyone looking for a new tattoo should go see her
great work ladies
thats kinda what i was thinking anyways
my appointment was for 1030 in the morning i was the first client of the day
your first visit is 10 off too
too late to go to another place
as she was cutting she was very open about what she was doing and even further consulted me along the way before making major snips in the front
joe has a gentle touch  a great personality
i had gabby shes an amazing stylist and all around a really friendly person
the service is amazing and liz is great
within minutes of the shot and start of the iv my nausea and chills were gone
i was trying out other babershops  around phoenix
she was ultra thorough and worked on my problem areas with such expertise and care
everyone is friendly they have chill music and a pretty salon
the estatician was knowledgable and was very thorough with everything and used a plucker to pluck any strays that didnt get pulled out
my hair stylist was jacluyn locust and she did a awesome job giving my hair the make over it desperately needed
i booked an appointment for that very weekend to see kim
if coming from the supercuts greatclips etc
jw marriott did offer to call a service to get us another chair when they informed the new person involved that they would be taking the large wheel chair back
gel removal with a fresh gel manicure in less than an hour
i needed relaxation and massage due to stress with the line of work im in
the studio is so cute and inviting
well at least they got their service but i didnt
i was comfortable in the environment getting my tattoo but i definitely feel like i paid a lot of money just for the name and ended up with a mediocre piece
i usually get the triple play which is a cut shampoo and hot towel
you can tell her what you like and she knows exactly what to do
better than any strip spa because of the nice and private pool
that should be the norm but unfortunately it is not
i really wanted to like this place coworkers told me they go here all the time but it was seriously disappointing
their new location is under the name starz nails from what i am assuming was the previous business that vacated the spot
i was very impressed no salon has ever done that
overlyexpensiveextensions in the past gave me huge regretbuyer remorse not the case with ashley and her product
i love these guyssweet friendly and they know their stuff about both piercings and stretching piercings which is rare among pro piercers
thank you so much dr richards
had a massage with christina
had my first waxing service with antoinette and she did a fabulous job and i wasnt nervous at all
it was a very relaxing experience from my fantastic manicure to my pedicure complete with tangerine sugar scrub
there is a reason that master pho is world renowned and that is because he possesses tattoo skills which are worthy of acknowledgement from fans and tattoo artists around the world
its bright and warm with a mix of old furniture and punk rockish signs and hangers on the wall
im 51 and i feel pretty
ive been planning to get a scorpion tattoo for some time now
there are no appointments luckily i was able to get in right away probably because it was right when they opened
the mystic tan here does just as good as a job as airbrushing at most places
not only because he is always available but because he is so talkative and friendly and nice be sure to tip these guys they work really hard
go see her she is phenomenal
i will definitely be returning and i have finally found my go to place
i just had one two weeks ago and thats a pretty good price
i am not easy on my nails at all and they have withstood typing cooking baking and cleaning
her name was gina
she did my back and threaded my eye brows in 30 minutes
i didnt have to wait  more than 5 minutes on a friday or saturday night
the word  is definitely as to how good they are
not only does my 5 year old love getting his hair cut here but my almost 2 year old also loves it
i want to post my story simply to inform consumers of my experience  take it or leave it
they were on sale so i thought id give it a try
i really adore this place
this place is a monthly visit and is an essential downtown establishment
best service in town hands down
she was very attentive as well with how i wanted my makeup done and the finished product wow
i really appreciate such excellent customer service considering i am in the hospitality industry  and jessica went above and beyond the entire experience
check in went pretty quickly even though there was a line about 5 receptionists checking people in
the massage itself was great and i was very pleased with the result
she thanked me for calling but i havent heard anything else on the matterwhich is fine i guess
i went on a sunday and had the owners husband do my nails
ask for lily
ive been to other spas but since i found this one its my goto
worst experience of my life
i was walking around with my horrible hair for days
i had a manicure and got a heart on two fingers and since they said it was so small they didnt charge me for it
its not just about getting you out
the morning of the surgery i showed up to piper surgical center scottsdale shea and 2 out of the 3 nurses who worked with me for preop prep commented on how all the nurses were excited to have dr mosharrafa working in their hospital due to his stellar reputation and warm demeanor he had recently moved his overnight surgical location to piper from somewhere else
the rate is cheaper since its off the strip 6500night includes that resort fee that all the hotels charge guests here in vegas
only the best soaps ever made
i spoke to the lady at the front desk and let her know i never want this lady again
this is the 3rd time i get my waxing here after my eastern european wax lady turned sadist on me
to great clips credit the prices are really inexpensive and even with a bunch of people waiting it only takes about 20 minutes to get started on your haircut
they want you to be satisfied with their work to develop a long term client
i was able to score 4 of these and i felt theyre great for lil girls
while i got my piercings my husband had our daughters name tattooed
still very happy with my hair stylist bonnie
i recently decided to get acrylic nails
it is a smaller place  but dont let that discourage you theres a bigger one right above that i tried as well the woman wasnt very friendly when i went
worst experience ive ever had
decided to get my lashes done for the first time with the amazing lash studio because i have heard great things about their lash extensions
the amount of pressure she gives is perfect and i cant complement her services enough
being a new las vegas resident i have been looking for a salon to come to regularly so happy i found hair connection
yes bathrooms are on smaller side
theres not too much to ask from a spa for a man like me except to not make me bleed when youre trimming my cuticles and they didnt so they get there kudos and a little more for the small talk and humour
the only hotel in vegas that charges coffee maker 2000 per day
i will never go anywhere else
everyone always friendly
the sweet lady was swamped bout 10 ppl came in  out while i was there  crystal only looked around hair colors snail polish wher phone in hand
we went for a bit of side bang and she told me that i can come back to go shorter if i feel brave
as a guy im picky about my hair cuts and would rather pay more the 1st time to get it done right
i dont have to curl my lashes or apply tons of mascara
with my 5 and 7 year old and wife
hair service is decent but was charged for a correction as the previous colour came out uneven and wasnt what was negotiated
its so disappointing because it takes forever for my hair to grow out and i have to live with this hair that i hate now
this spot is a hidden gem
didnt file underneath the nail didnt request i scrub my nails before putting on clear coat the acrylic is uneven and bubbling
the online phone number doesnt work and the phone number provided on the groupon sounds like a personal voicemail and when i leave a message and texts i dont hear back
every nail tech ive had has been pleasant  aside from the times a few have been high pressure on the upsell
kim is really amazing
monet monsano is a world renowned makeup artist and instructor
i kinda feel like she rubs my face roughly to get the the ink and numbing cream off it but it bothers me because my face is sensitive
i would go elsewhere if you want a luxuryspalike atmosphere but if you want a damn good deep tissue massage this is the place to go
she also accepts online reservations
i am very very particular about my hair and they catered to all of my needs
i called and was told they dont not comp repairs because it has been too long they only do a week
great service professional and very welcoming
i politely explained to manager what happened and asked if he could help
i lost all of the length i was growing the past few months for my upcoming wedding
such an amazing experience
i have been going to splendid nails for several years now
really bad jobs and very poor customer services in madison
and they usually run pretty ontime with appointments which is somewhat rare with busy salons
turnover is probably the same as any other budget haircut place but ive seen the same few stylists for a while now
the owner and staff are wonderful
i arrived late on thursday night around 1030pm
went on saturday they are open late and accept walkins i called ahead to see about a wait and headed in
if you try nothing else try the dream cream  it is absolutely the most amazing skin cream i have ever tried and smells yummy
this was a pissy experience
below average service throughout
i told kristina that i had never done anything like this but she did not give me any warning
it is clean and no stink
thank you so much for the great experience
next is the weird circular work stations
went here because i saw they had a great special on groupon  49 for cut partial highlight glaze and blowout
the salon itself deserves 5 stars however a tip for all new members get anything that you are offered in writing so they remember what they say
she even remembered me from the last time i had gone in
i just found out that this salon has been around the asu and mill ave district for 5 years
i will post signs all over
everyone is helpful and professional and really do work hard to make sure you enjoy your visit
highly recommended by me
the staff is friendly but if you are about the anail game this place isnt for you
each of us found something we could eat but it was not a pleasant meal
they were friendly and do good work
well done 7 day spa and nails
i have had facials and waxing from marie de pirro from face logic several times
it was very difficult to book the appointment because every time i called no one would pick up
really pleased with the result and is really easy to manage
the salon is clean and the massage chairs they have while you get the pedi is great
i drive from north scottsdale every month to see laura and wouldnt think of going any other place
i liked that they gave out a free sample of oatmeal scrub soap before and that they have wipes available for you
i came in and was greeted promptly and courteously
he took his time to make sure every strand was cut the proper length  which is more than i can say for the last salon i went to that charged more than 100
i have a high pain tolerance but i suspect that she can dial it down easily
i think this resort has grown on me
ive missed two days of work and will probably miss two more when this would have cleared up had he just prescribed what works
i have had my hair cut by one of the ladies who works there and it was a good cut
if your new to the korean spa ritual just remember to shower before entering the water and after you sweat in the steamsauna rooms its all nudeexcept in the coed area
after long time in vegas i found a better hair salon to cut my hair
spent a couple of hours here one morning
dont waist your time or money
you can enjoy the appropriately named oasis relaxing on their lounge chairs and couches or get there early if you want to commandeer one of the beds
first i explained to him what im looking for then he advised me on a haircut that fits my face shape and my professional career
when i questioned the price she indicated it was because me nails are long
wont see me again
minimum tip was 10  as per recommended by the facility
i tipped 25 because they are well worth it
a very important part of my order was overlooked in error
this is where i buy all my hand sanitizer that i take with me on my various trips around the world
very nice  will always come back
the guy who did my manicure was friendly and did my nails beautifully
i did a little web research and found teres
because that would mean im paying  40 for a massage that is already  40
id love to say at their loft suite one day
give it a shot you wont regret it
my brain went numb
i should have gone to where i use to go
i wanted a woman
i was getting married that day and i was a bit disappointed by that
i walked away it feeling rested and taken care of
it was a long and sometimes very discouraging process but i cant speak enough to the professionalism of tiara who did my hair
the person who cut my hair was a gentleman from colombia named orlando he was very friendly and professional
i cant wait to go back tomorrow for a fresh manicure for the holiday season
theyre in my price range and the nails look immaculate
its not like i was asking for multiple treatments or anything drastic
my massage sessions were awesome here i highly recommend the spa
dlisa definitely knows what she is doing especially with mens eyebrows
one of the first things i noticed was that they use liners in the foot bath tubs
candace and her sister are both top notch and will make you feel right at home
kevin really is the best
they make nearly impossible to find the phone number to cancel
i have been finished with my treatments now for about a month
she was the ethiopian older lady with reddish hair
with an assortment of other areas from upper and lower lip chin side burns neck and underarms from anywhere from 315
i told her i would not pay
gotta say even as i get alot of flack for visiting health spas it is definitely one of the best things i believe you can do for yourself when a feeling of stress is about
they use hard wax and they use it much better than any other salon ive been to
april 2013 first time here
miguel is amazing
fortunate for me that i hadnt wasted my time by showing up for a cancelled appointment
what is the point of making an appointment
yes her business is home based but january 3rd if i recall correctly her own store by much music will open up
my son picked up a snow globe which then broke in his hand
bertha is so amazing
for something simple i think the institute is a great bet
there was no orange glow
the spa staff were extremely friendly and helpful pointing out all the fabulous amenities and answering any questions
she is amazing
didnt get the nail technician name but she was gentle and precise
the number one feature that brought us to lifetime though was the indoor pool which was open all day
had terrible experience here
she was quick and knew exactly what i wanted
the office staff has been very friendly
unfortunately two of my nails on my left hand are lifting after two weeks
she looked at the photo of the lowlights i wanted and brought it to life while causing no further damage to my overly processed hair
salisa is lovely and has many many years of experience first working in hotels then the spa across the street from where she is now then opened up her own place
there isnt a single chip the polish isnt too thick and he didnt grind off my nails like some of the other salons do
i came in on an early monday afternoon
i went to the same gal in vancouver for 20 years and i hope to have the same relationship here as well
i just moved back to town and she is a few minutes down the street from me
love this place
i love this place
his wifegirlfriend did my wax was great
ive been coming here for 6 months now
for 5
she does it all cut color bang trimming and even styling for special occasions
besides the wonderful facials  her  recommended products are fantastic and perfect for my difficult dry skin issues
brody is the best
now i have no choice but to let it grow out for the next few months to get it back to the length i had it originally
this will destroy nails
i showed her my pictures and told her my story of the lopsided hair cut and assured her i didnt want that again  she was very warm and receptive and really seemed to listen to what i was saying and the simple style i was going for
i took pictures in of  how i wore my hair during the summer
my spot to get my nails done tiffany is my nail artist
threading 5 ambiance 3 price 4 i found this place when walking on nicolson looking for a salon that offers threading for a reasonable price
on my last night there was a giant and bright full moon which i enjoyed by opening my curtains and letting the moonlight shine into my room
she is so fun to be around and i would recommend her a million times over
at first i admit i was taken aback a bit as i was just getting a facial but knew it was standard
my pedicure was soso but i was with my sister who had christine and she was wonderful
went to this place because it was  close to my grandmas house and it was a last minute thing before going out on the strip
ive seen tori and sarah here for eyebrow threading and they both do an amazing job
need a wax
they spent less than five minutes giving me thick lashes
i got the signature which was supposed to include the hot towel and a massage i got the hot towels but not massage
hannah at the front desk was very friendly and got me settled
eyebrows for 10 nothing too crazy or exceptionally amazing just walked in around 6pm on a week night
its great bang for the buck for this kind of bodywork
the one girl actually sat there with her feet up in front of me and drank coffee while looking at me funny and complaining about one of her coworkers
one of the best massages ive received well be back for sure and next time well remember our suits so we can enjoy the 15 add on spa room in the backjacuzzi sauna and showers
the actual spa treatments were mediocre and extremely overpriced  the facial felt hesitant and vague the nail treatment just ok and overly saturated with conversation at the expense of activity
as a personal trainer i recommends all my clients with back issues to dr steve now about 4 of my clients have become patients of global chiropractic
good thing i kept my clothes i was wearing skinny jeans  long sleeves tee
very friendly and very clean
waxing with jill feels normal now and every time is a great experience
book your appt
the staff is very nice and welcoming
then it gets worst  finally after all of this huge mess keep in mind how badly my face was burnt and i am more than willing to show pictures
the salt room is interesting and is small
katie is amazing with nails and fast too
its was my first time ever having a procedure so clearly i was a little skeptical but from my first appointment the staff was friendly  the doctors was amazing everyone makes you feel so comfortable i would highly recommend them to anyone for any type of improvement you would like done
skinovative and center for venous disease is more than just a medical spa
ill never go anywhere else
i canceled  left
hes heavy handed just the way i like i suggest anyone who likes a lot of pressure or deep tissue massages to see him
you feel relaxed just being in her presence
they are so sweet love chatting it up with gals
thanks for the help today
no one likes a bad hair day let alone a bad haircut
while i was sitting in the chair i also took note of how the front greeted customers as they walked in
voicemail after voicemail just to schedule an appointment
so happy with my manicure
although it wasnt a wow experience ill likely return
right before the appointment she called to say that she ran late on a previous client and needs to cancel
only reason it doesnt get five stars is i really dont like the air quality
so i decided to give life spa a chance
the casino layout is better than most and the air purification is too
the moment i walked in i was greeted by friendly staffs and the nail technician did a wonderful job
i have also been walking and adding to my milage of 35 miles 35days a week
the other nail consultant said that i had pretty hands
parking easy and convenient selfparking or valet room super clean very modern comfortable extremely spacious and super quiet
its a joke
everything else is similar to walgreens everywhere
i am thrilled with the results and would highly recommend her
i love this place and look forward to going back for my next appointment
my sons cut was so bad that i thought my wife was going to faint when she saw it
i recently found this salon from my towns facebook page and then looked it up on yelp and saw all the great reviews i also searched it on instagram and i loved the work
i got a 60 acrylic  gel manicure and my nails came out super wonky
she was quick and did a great job
and denied my request for a little extra rinse
if you want the best you have to ask for the manager girl
ive been seeing maggie as my esthetician
very patient  caring w her clients  lovable personality fosure
i looked around and everyone had a juicebox but me
will be back for sure
after reading some of the other reviews i was a little apprehensive to try this place out as i have really thick and curly hair that requires some extra tlc
the massage chairs  ohmygosh
my husband son and daughter were very pleased with their stylist
they did a great job which is why im not giving them 1 star
by the 6th day of having my nails 6 of them were off
only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation finally had a chance to stay in a studio room this weekend
i didnt give him a easy task and i felt most confident he would follow thruand he did so
no im sorry for this long process or hey heads up this is going to take us 25 hours to dolet us know if you would like to come back at another time and we will reschedule you
she and the other two stylists were very friendly and chatty with all of us
there is no reason to make an appointment with this business
do not hesitate to schedule an you will be blown away with the results
the rooms inside are really nice and wellappointed with comfy beds and bathrooms where the showertoilet is a separate are from the sink area
i called the next day and asked if they could fix it because i was really unhappy with it after living with it for a day and the girl told me i could come in
they were also not overly friendly
brin was a blast to spend three hours on the chair with i always enjoy learning about others life stories
ran my card 5  times all while complaining very load that my card wasnt working
i was a little intimidated by the intense directions i was given however it was super easy to find with her help
what a waste of money and a bad experience
i will never go somewhere else i especially like he fact that its a doctor doing my botox
i would go here every weekend if i lived in the armpit that is phoenix
although it was still cleansing it felt very rushed
as if that werent enough my stylist noelle worked absolute magic with my hair
and she did an awesome job
he has carte blanche to do whatever he wants to try and the results are always great
i guess they are closed
7028370202 sandy is moms favorite and when i called jade nails to book an appointment with sandy a gentleman answered the phone and informed that sandy and fay have sold the store and moved to vietnam 2 months ago and that was a lie because sandy did moms nails just a month ago
they said their spa would be good for a bachelorette but i kind of disagree
today i my appointment was pushed back 30 minutes without any notice
cant say enough about jason and joe
toni more than made up for the new tech who probably needs a little more training  the fact i had to come back three times
hawaii is very limited with stylists that can do my hair so i fly to las vegas approximately every 23 months just for nneke to do my hair
have been a customer of kaitlyn now for a year and i always walk out with a great cut
customer service was what i expected great and ambiance was really nice
the spa also offered some complimentary water juice and fruits
i highly recommend this salon and its fun community
joubliais lidal est entre 5c et 15c
collectively we have had 11 tattoos done here and we will continue to go back as often as possible
she guided me through the process and set me up with great supplements to further my cleansing
they gave us a map of the property and showed us where we were where to park and of course our room location
she is very reasonable with pricing and has products for sale as well
he loves being able to play video games while getting his hair cut so he actually enjoys going to do something most kids complain about
not happy with my manicure today
strato is the best
i come here on the regular once a month sometimes every other month and heres why i was never a fan of deep tissue massages until i came here
ashley is the absolute best
when i tried to tell her she started getting very defensive and said she saw nothing wrong with it
i found this incredibly helpful especially with everything else i had going on
we have always received great service as well as great deals
since ive been a customer i have received constant compliments on lynns glitters and nail artistry
random glitch in their terminals
i couldnt recommend european wax center  sarah enough
all she said to me is im so sorry we are totally booked
the last time i went there was about 23 months ago
not to mention they are cash only now and they were acting like i was going to walk out without paying then the girl that did my nails had other people she could have tended to but decide to follow me to the bathroom and watch me like a hawk even tho i gave her my phone while i ran to an atm in the same parking lot
mike is a lip god
i also love how the other stylists chip in with ideas and advice
for my taste i liked this place
cluck that i bounced
magic pure magic as per usual
however beware of the vdara reflecting ray
a friend asked hows the massage
came here for the first time after work to get threading on eyebrows
she is patient and kind
being able to work on my computer in the sun in a bathing suit in semiprivacy is delightful
all in all a decent 354 star rating
nonetheless they allowed us to soak our feet while the other group finished
together those would cost an extra 10 at the last few salons where i have been
after she finished the acrylic i had to ask her to fix those two very obvious mistakes
i have been going to the same lady for my manicures and pedicures for eight years
all this for 50 during az spa week
multiple back and forth we booked for an appointment that is free of charge today one exact week later saturday
i will be going back there for sure i highly recommend both of them
the staff was nice and professional
carrie however is a godsend
i highly recommend kimberly and the perfect hue team for all your color and hair cut needs
the piercing prices are a little high but i have gotten 10 piercings here and they have all turned out relatively fine
i was on a girls weekend with 4 of my best friends and we decided to treat ourselves to a spa day
also remember to tip
the customer service here is amazing
great and through face massagelike i said had a technique to her not just rubbing hard
i have found a new waxing home
whats great is that i am already off of the medication and only using the special body wash  i gained my confidence back again and could not be happier and more thankful to dr kimble who was there all the way for me
they have always done a nice job and are polite
avoid avoid avoid
i also like that the other artists come in a check up on what other artists are doingits like a team shop which is nice
very professional and a relaxing atmosphere
that is one of the great things about ulta
dear reviewers reading i been going here since january 2013and for once a month after with my first brazilian wax in january ever since going i always have a pleasant experience with cassandra
you know how painful it can be to put your head in a hair washing sink
other than that i loved it and would definitely come back
however i trusted that she would do a good job since i heard so many good things about viva
tip check out their page on wayspacom to see their monthly promotions and other deals
the products are really great as well
she also told me that she wished that i had come in before writing a negative review and told them about how i felt
i have been a fan of this store for years but never thought of it as more than just liking the product itself
highly recommend this place to everyone
definitely go if you live here or are in town
she didnt acknowledge my presence
i prefer thin because it looks more natural
to go even further lisa just added a whole new side to the business taking the nextdoor space which is dedicated to facials 39 facials folks
the atmosphere was very calm and peaceful
my fiance didnt get his nails buffed but she put something on them at least
i was on the third floor and that night i heard bass music all night long and the refrigerator was super noisy
his resume is proof of the quality of his work
she then laughed and announced the price for that days haircut was 4600 this because she was promoted to a senior stylist whatever that means
im a terrible person for forgetting her name but she had long pretty blond hair
it is a very relaxing ambiance with fresh fruit chocolate and tea as well as super comfy robes that make you feel very relaxed and at ease
the cut was great and has grown out perfectly
so i was okay and happy with it
michael is awesome very professional and the shop is clean
now worst of all employees were not very friendly especially the asst
while painful the wax wasnt as bad as i was expecting and the results were great
the second thing that was certainly too expensive was espa after the sun lotion
my friend got her nails done into some halloween design i did short french tips with glitter and i look over at my friend sister and the lady was actually able to paint a coyfish on her nails they looked so pretty i was impressed
i said now
highly recommend this amazing lash location but they are probably all good
its expensive and you smell like salon after
its a small place but the nail technicians are amazing
she never once apologized
i would definitely come back without hesitation
i got my tan 5 days ago and it still looks like day 1 i highly recommend hello glo
she has never messed them up
im always hesitant to try new nail places as ive definitely had unfavorable experiences in the past
ive been back to this salon 4 times now thats a record
i cannot actually review the service because my phone call went unreturned
using a medical grade disinfectant this is a huge deal when picking your tanning salon
beautiful nails from both
my husband and i were in vegas for a wedding and i thought it would be great for him to get a really nice hair cut and a straight razor shave
the staff is super friendly and they all make you feel comfortable when youre with them
i am not a big fan of the ambiance of the place
after hes finished he sends me over to the dryer and gives me a brief shoulder massage
kim did my lashes yesterday and did a beautiful job
since i had a very good impression when i visitedfound the prices to be very reasonablethe staff very personableill give it a 5
i do not care how many times the bottle may say brazil or moroccan or oil or keratin or smooth there is absolutely nothing that comes close to repairing the hair as quickly as this process
she fixed my orange hair and i will be going back to her next time
i highly recommend seeing her for your next hair need
its individuals like yourself that make our industry look bad and make my career look like a joke
i came very close to just ending the entire massage several times
if you want to be able to show your hands off come here to see charlie
elite nails is the best
my masseuse amanda i had to tell her three time to give me more pressure on my massage
the nurse i had at the beginning of my appointment was extremely sweet and make me feel less nervous as she could tell i was a little frazzled
daisy is very good
a plus is they are located where you can shop and eat afterwards not to mention the candy store across the way great place to go for a few hours
i asked some simple questions about the services they offer and the girl on the phone couldnt really answer any
im impressed with his talent as an artist he described why he was doing certain things as he was designing my tattoo its amazing and more beautiful than i ever thought
she was super easy to book with and these lashes turned out so great
a one hour massage cost me about 70 after tip
they completely butchered my straight shoulder length hair
im from san mateo ca and lost my wonderful stylist maria as a result
now i have a massive blister on my foot from it and the day that i had gotten it done it was my birthday
so here is the deal not every office or doctor is for everyone
came to the room right away to save my hangover
place is cute clean and friendly
the pedicure was worth every cent and i for see many future visits here to try out their different services
she was definitely showing some of the signs of a sociopath
she does wedding hair party hair or your everyday hair needs
shes simply the best at what she does
they do offer several frequent flyer programs that they will try to softsell you and actually those programs will save you some bucks so i will consider buying one next time
hair pollution is a prime example of a diamond in the rough
i have had some good luck in finding some great masseurs here too
i waited for approximately 10 mins and was greeted by eddie
christine and yoga breeze made this all possible i can not say enough about the studio the great people there both the staff and students
i noticed esmeralda saw jessica washing my hair so i figured she was just checking to see where her bookedappointment customer was
went in monday again told nothing apply to my vip  mtm contract i just signed with them two weeks ago
beware never go there again
thanks girl  have a great time at every appt
he was able to fully relax during his 1hour massage and he told me he would be happy to revisit the place later
just roll it into the room fee for heavens sake
been here in for several cuts and always done right
it has a great vibe and everyone is very sweet and hospitable
the swedish massage was pretty good though and on the expensive side
after a whole body massage which was not what we booked i went out front and my husband was still sitting there and they hadnt ever taken him back
the decor of the casino is beautiful
i feel lighter stronger and just down right healthier
they are located close to where i live which makes it so convenient
i will probably return someday but i think ill try my luck somewhere else in a few weeks when im ready for another manipedi
ive been happy with my hair cut and color every time ive been here
we got the corner suite and it is around 900 sqft
sallys selection is great the store is well organized and hardly ever crowded
edited two days later to add the owner responded and offered to either honour the credit for a spa treatment later this week or a full refund for the qualifying massage i had in august
marilyn once again outdid herself when she did the works on me lips eyebrows  eyeliner
as we entered we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and were asked to fill out a form for our service providers
very friendly staff and the quality of service is excellent
i dont know why they didnt seal the tips but they didnt and they started peeling from there down
the recliner chairs are awesome and just be careful of falling asleep
my favorite tanning place in vegas
we went again with that someone who knew someone who knew the same thing about this place
i found the design and color and told him id return
ive been going back ever since which is something i didnt think id do after the wedding
the procedure is fast
such a terrible experience it was painful now i need a massage for my massage
what more could you want from an offthestrip nail salon
hanna is so amazing
my nail artist was pleasant and did a good job on my toes
im still basking in the glow of this place
stop by and see for yourself
there was just a bit of misunderstanding and like i said i feel like it was my fault
after walking in and picking out a color i waited and waited and waited no one said anything to me
her technique is amazing and she works quickly without leaving out details
each was an hour long
normally im hesitant to go other nail salons because i have been going to mine for over 10 years
im giving myshapelipo only one star based on my experience with them
i highly recommend shamika for all your hair style needs
sucks when theres a bad seed with a power mouth that doesnt give you a moment to ask a question
they do good haircuts and they shave your neck with a razor
she is amazing
i have tried several of the facials a relaxation massage and manicurepedicure services
gel is more expensive because it usually last 3weeks
her work is very quick
but other than that theyve got every brand of hair i could think of
looking out the windows the spa is enclosed by a fence along with beautiful desert greenery
would highly recommend this place for a comfortable and relaxing experience
i followed up with her via email next morning
taylor exceeded my expectations
she then did a deep conditioning which was just conditioner on my hair and sitting under the hood again
i went there last night i went there kind of late and had only hour left to closing time
another great thing about this massage
stella checks for these many times and my hair line has never been crooked
while my mother and i are not spa virgins were certainly not well spa sluts
i have been going to this clinic for over a year and a half to get laser treatment done in a small area and was told to experience hair reduction by 6080 in 4 sessions
dr fulton and his staff are amazing
first of all not only is the shop super clean and very rockerish im sure hence the name but this being my first tattoo ever everyone we spoke to made everything pretty perfect
over the years ive pretty much given up on getting a good haircut
tracy understands that going naturaldoesnt mean looking unpolished
and i was very much impressed with how well everyone spoke english
after putting the stencil on my arm he decided he could do better
love this place
no luck this place is always packed
the only downside is that it is a bit pricey
if you are looking for ambiance then i would suggest a premiumluxury spa
since it was my first colonic i was pretty nervous
i will not return
i did not want my breasts to get in the way when i run
its not that great guys lets be real
not the fault of the waxologist and she handled it well and made me feel fine
exfoliating shaving before hand and no showers for 8 hours after
deanne transformed my hair color to a blonde with darker lowlights perfect for my skin and eye color just as she recommended
im all sadi read the reviews and was all excited to get a rock star pedi and come to find out they arent accepting new clients
even though i am incredibly low maintenance and lazy with my hair i find it enjoyable to style it
the guy who runs it is so friendly knowledgeable and accommodating
but at the end of the day this isnt so much about my loud 16 month old this is more about being treated with respect and like a human being
i also saw that they have hydra facial treatment and couldnt resist to try
went here looking for a straight razor refill the good quality kind with the gf when we first walked in she was asked kindly to leave her bag at the counter which she gladly did i think so i couldnt sucker her in to paying i am glad i did not have my satchel on
this place is anything but upscale
nothing that you dont need in a barber and everything that you do  nobody is pretending to be anything here this place and the people are real
i am always referring friends and family to south pointe
however this isnt true
launey cut my hair for the first time a few days ago
i recently lost about 70 of my big toe nail due to a minor injury and it was hideous looking
a little upset because the barber only did a royal shave and he forgot to shave my husband head
i had to go into the bathroom to rewet my hair to see what it might look like that really isnt acceptable
i also feel like the rm3 program was super individualized to me based on my current weight body fat labs etc compared with other popular weight loss programs
the cotton robes are very cheap
worst experience ever
you call booking four peepo
i would not have found this product if she hadnt looked into it for me
left without any neck pain
she then went on a little lecture binge about how we were very limited by my kind of hair on the fine side and color lots of golds and white because it used to be red
i have always had sparse brows and wanted to do something to help
the classes
this place may be good for its inventory of cigars but not as a barber shop
the whole process from the consent form my technician greeting me and lash application was seamless
he asserted his preference based on comfort rather than considering what i wanted
this spa is amazing
service while checking in was pretty lackluster
sandra seemed perfectly pleasant at first if a bit over talkative
dont miss the experience of having your hair cut by someone who knows hair better than you know how to breathe
that was by far the best massage i have ever had
i was scheduled with one of their junior stylists aletha
i was here for a face mask and the lady working was super nice and helpful
popped back in later that day for a shellac manicure which was also very well done and i left absolutely pleased
ive been going to mary for almost 4 months and i dont see myself going to any other lash artist
i have lived in the same area as this shop for a few years
yes i could have complained and asked to have it fixed but i did not want to put my hair through the correction process
i got there and was greeted very warmly and met with the artist morgan gatekeeper
it was the worst experience of my life and i regret every second of it
i was a little skeptical at first because of my preconceived notions on health products but i checked it out on a friends recommendation and i definitely plan on going back to try more menu items
special thanks to ashlei who made me feel so pampered today
marilyn is the best in the industry
definitely worth a visit
only plus side is they edge with a straight edge razor which is a nice touch
never had any problems with this location
decided to give this place a second chance after not being too pleased with the service i received the first time
meistens ist dort nicht viel los man kann sich also entspannt umschauen die verkufer sind sehr freundlich
i got both my eyebrow and upper lip done for 16
we are going to check out the sanctuary resort in scottsdalepleasant valley and may end up moving our annual spa trip away from the boulders but we hope that wont be necessary
very happy with how it turned out and i left the salon with my hair feeling better than ever
some of the best trainers i have been around
i love my nails
it was less a massage and more just rubbing lotion on me
i have long hair and she is always excited and ready for the challenge and i couldnt ask for a better out come
gave 4 stars because the polish job isnt the best ive had
once the girl finished her conversation in the back room she came up to the desk to check me in
great location parking is easy
great smaller spa
my scar is completely covered with an amazing piece of art that i am so proud to show off
i believe they should remind you when they call 24 hours to confirm that this is the policy but they will not do that
went here on a sunday around 130pm with a groupon
i love the fact that she is mobile or i can meet her at a location
any woman that gets this stuff done on a regular basis has no reason to ever frown
you can tell it is a very popular place by how busy they are right up until their closing time
i was in and out in a half hour including the time it took to do paperwork and pay at the end
apparently its an old style system and they have to turn the valves in the ceiling in each room to activate it
i got a great bronze color after a few days of having my membership
and they hit you with the fee up front so again wtf
after reviewing some yelp reviews and doing extra research we decided to give ironhorse a call
imprint yoga is relatively new since they only opened for a month or so they would need some time to get establish i might come back again to try another class or 2
robby does beautiful work
adrienne  i had the pleasure of meeting adrienne coming in for a fill and he took the initiative to go ahead and offer his time for a full set
and customer service were all amazing
i went in to get my nails done and i really appreciated the detail that was put into my nails
my first time here was a month ago  tri i believe he is the manager also was my nail tech
my cuticles werent even pushed back the polished chipped 5 minutes after i left the place and they were hardly filed or buffed
when we are in vegas i always make an appointment to see him
when i called to schedule an appointment the person told me that she doesnt accept new clients because they take too long and i needed to return the groupon
shannon has been cutting my hair for 3 years
now when i went in to speak with that employee she is boldly lying to my face saying that she had said something completely different
the atmosphere is very professional without being pretentious
i also liked that it was a roomy nail salon and didnt feel so cramped
went at least 2 times a month
otherwise id be going to sephora where they know how to treat their customers
every 2 weeks i spend 70 and always go to the same girl
the male barber did a great job detailing the back of the neck i thought
they have some very talented hairdressers matt collins for example is an expert colourist and stylist and shawna
sounded as if they didnt have lunch or were going to eat some where
finally came the piercing it hurted but depends on your pain tolerance
great overall experience
he shrugged and said nothing we can do about that then rang me up for 155 not including tip
they only let us use one coupon because we all paid together but we wont be using the other
i dont know if hes the owner of this location but his attitude sucks
i got a design with my pedi
the staff is friendly and can help you achieve the look you want
mary really goes the extra mile for her customers and that to me is irreplaceable
i think there are benefits for everyone
all at inflated prices
she then recommended me to have an ipl facial and to use her highly effective products clear cell
and definitely reasonably priced
have gone here for years and keep coming back for my pedicures and gel manicures
i moved from texas in december and was not able to make my very last appointment with my stylist of over 25 years
thank you to floyds and their outstanding staff for the service you guys rock
walked in there were 2 guys working one said hi gave him my name and appointment time
i have tried many hair salons in my life and this is probably the best
its like your grandma or uncle is going to do your hair but they appear as if they have experience of course
make the appointment you wont be disappointed
super disappointed with my trip to this salon after reading all these positive reviews i was extremely disappointed
the lowest three rooms were like 3944 centigrade one was about 72 and the hottest one was 99 i felt i was like a baked bacon when i slept in it
my nails  hands and feet both look great
given that i am the queen wimp of deep tissue massage i usually find my massage the opposite of relaxed
they use new nail tools for each person and they open the package in front of you
try it out for a quick pedii dont think youll be disappointed
she must be so incompetent to not be able to do math remember what happened 5 minutes prior and create symmetry in eyebrows
or maybe it was 10 iono
my nails lift fast but not with him
he gave me the wrong medication and when i called to explain that no one would return my calls
incredible experience here  they use plastic to line the tubs for your pedicure
this gym is pretty cool
never ever go to this place worst experience ever no customer service
very relaxing  you dont want to leave
went in for the 28 manipedi
they never call to remind of the appointment either which i think should be a common courtesy these days
i told her my hair is two colours and al she could tell me is that oh it will wash out  another fault of mine is not demanding her to make it right and instead i just smile like an idiot and pray its not bad and secretly wishing someone else could confront her because shes not amazing in english and shes been so nice the whole time but no one did and it was really bad anyways paid and left and ran to another salon and to get it fixed broke the bank and fried my hair but at least my hair doesnt look like a mess
it turned out fantastic
i went to r salon a month or so ago for the chocolate mani pedi on living social
got a pedicure 28
she took me to dinner my choice and i picked inyo so i took her for a massage after dinner
the sugar scrub was sensational
i cant say enough about the wonderful staff and amazing results
she said rudely no its too long to spike up it wont work
they took 59 and i used it for my service
both of my daughters have their color and styles crafted here
not only will it help you maintain but will help get rid of the fine lines even skin tone i have fair skin tone and brighten you up
loved this location
she then rushes to catch up to where the other ladies were in the process all the while laughing and joking and talking to the other ladies
and now i can safely complain right here from my computer
4 very quiet
sooooo with this said i will not be returning to attractive nail  spa i will continue to make the extra drive and at least there they pretend  to be happy to see me and my wallet
i also get laser done with the lady here i cant remember her name ive only had 1 laser treatment done here so i cant really say much about it but marci is definitely the best for threading
i just loved this salon
wonderful service and wonderful technicians
i did not need a fill just new gel
my very first cut with her was a drastic one
we just returned back to california from our vegas trip
awesome place for a family meal or just to get together
i never saw andy anymore who i like alot  well i found andy shop he left he is at 83rd and thunderbird at pro nails  i am changing my nail place
the casino was on the quiet side and had a lot of seniors in it
once you walk passed that area they have tea room with a large selection of teas in silk bags and magazines
this is my favorite place to get my haircut
jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde do ever
i was so ready and relaxed for my massage and ended up not repeating the circuit which honestly once felt just fine
after breakfast we walked around one of the hotels and i got an email that our room was ready it was already 9 am at this point
same girls familiar faces extremely helpful
shes great at being on time and usually is finishing her last appointment as i arrive
and she is a very warm fun person and its always nice to see her when i go in every 9 months or so
the interior of the building is underwhelming but the inside of the spa is just right
it is near stores that i shop at very frequently so i will be back that is for sure
i love it and thats that
the barber joe rodriguez at dannys barber shop is very professional does an amazing job and is very easy to talk to
i called and made an appointment with a coworker for her to get a pedicure and me a full settoes painted at noon
my wife and i just spent the weekend at the vdara and loved it
they then charged me when my husband had already loaded a gift card that was supposed to be waiting for me
5 steaknshake 6 75 cent hot dogs 7 bowling alley bingo arcade and movie theaters
they were ready for me when i got there and had a ton of polish colors to choose from
she wasnt that experienced either
thanks again jesse
i showed her pictures of what i was looking for and she was very helpful and listened to all that i wanted
what doctor looks at a rash on a patient and says the words that is beyond my ability
new to the charlotte area and looking for a new stylist
the owner did a cut and highlight
she greeted me at the door and asked me if i wanted a beverage before we began my new adventure
sarah then told me that i could go on groupon and purchase a voucher for 40 etc
ive never had a bad experience with them
yes you can get a tattoo anywhere but if service professionalism artistry and a sterile environment are important to you then paris tattoos is the place
this place is really tight on their payouts
i didnt save money and the spa is not nice
even my moh who works in a hair salon was very impressed by the work done here
highly recommend them to everyone
my nails always look great
everybody is hanging out
worst place to ever get your nails done
very good price for a job well done  awesome customer service
we usually stay at the hotel at mandalay bay and we love it but we have an open mind so we tried you out
literally the best pedicure and at an affordable price
we stayed for three nights during a november weekend as part of a wedding block and were just so disappointed by the overall feel of the place with one bigger problem that was just not met with any amount of concern from the management
i get a b12 shot here weekly
once it filled half way i dumped half of the bag of ice in the tub
and vicky delivered on her promise
i would definitely recommend this place 1 in parma
it was my first time here and left very happy with my nails
i looked on yelp and saw all the great reviews about this place and lindsay i made an appointment on a thursday afternoon for that evening but then realized that i wouldnt be able to make it because of a delay i had at the airport
i like them to look big and thick but not sloppy
would definitely recommend
theyve always got games on too
also she hooked it up
he is a complete perfectionist and lives up to his reputation the recovery had also been much better than i expected
our room was sweet
great atmosphere good music and very friendly staff
seriously have to question the work of a shop that cant be bothered to make an appointment
and she seemed to know what she was doing
i am a happy happy client
the foot and leg massage lasted a good amount of time and didnt seem rushed at all
the cabanas looked ok but we didnt bother trying to rent one
long was the best
i then went back and was greeted and waxed by elaine
although they werent busy today i would recommend making an appt
the professional work rivals any salon i have ever been in
i travel from yuma to see ivonne bran at this toni  guy once every 46 weeks
super super friendly
i purchased the big package  ayurvedic wellness consult facial head massage and full body massage
i have been going to nailsense for more than a year now and it is excellent
first time at her shop as well as with extensions and i would go back again
the whole staff is rad and ill never go anywhere else
heena is very funny and welcoming
still got charged 75 for a consultation
scottsdale101 massages are the best
im from out of town so i was looking from somewhere to get my nails done they do sns so i went with it
i have been going to krista jee now for a little bit over a year
well it didnt look right to me there was too much of a gap between the two and now that i write this there was no arch either
she just gets hair
if your in the area and need a cut id highly suggest you come here
so beautiful best service ever
i went to the event and had rave reviews on how i looked beautiful and natural
but somehow shaina did it
i love this place
great service came in to make a return since the product i originally purchased was a little to rough on my face
in the end my nail color came out nice
sri is the best
and its so much more than a hair cut almost like a therapy session i felt great leaving this place
i had to explain 3 times i am calling other salons i was just curious just wondering
my body was aching from being slouched in an office chair all day and you made me feel human again
i also saw construction toys that had grime in on the beds of the trucks
thursday my nails were perfect
instead she decided to bleach my roots with them still attached
spent an afternoon in phoenix waiting on a friend to arrive on a later flight so i found this place a couple miles from the airport and im so glad i did
well trusting the yelp reviews at that time was pretty good i decided i may as well see if they could help with my facial spider veins as well
i will be back
eine sehr grosse auswahl nette kassiererinnen und kurze schlangen an der kasse  was will man mehr
everyone i have sent to erin have nothing but positive things to say about her
i will be seeing you in a few weeks for a touch up
my skin is still glowing from my body wrap and facial
once i got there i met her and wow she looks stunning her face is so well taken care of very young looking
there is not much going on here so i would avoid this place if you are looking for a fun vegas experience
this store is adorable
kimmy and tim does nkt disappoint
she is superfriendly and is able to adapt pictures of haircuts from magazines or books into something that actually looks good on me rather than mimicing the style and leaving me with a haircut that looks lousy on me
i would stay here again in a heartbeat
i will definitely be going back
i have had 3 or 4 different technicians do the treatments on me since i never requested a particular person and they have all been female and pretty friendly although no nonsense about getting you in and out
he stated that they were busy and to go to that location
im on my 2nd visit to remove my tattoo and its already faded significantly
kyle did my nails the first time and was wonderful but he was with another client
the experience was horrible they were reading instructions while applying the powder and bantering back  forth
if you are in pain or stressed out go to mike
she is so amazing
i normally have the same girl do my nails but she was doing another ladies nails so they gave me to another lady as i was explaining what i wanted done she had a hard time understanding i tried my best to explainit was pretty simple she rolls her eyes at me and begins to get rude
she even suggested an extra touch just to help my fine hair not look so flat
i will be going back to tip again and i highly recommend this nail salon if youre ever in town and looking for great service and amazing nails
she applies consistent warm comforting pressure and her strokes are firm but relaxing
service was great and their staff is always happy to help
muki is amazing
cleanliness not all the foodempty bottles were picked up right away
i have been going to european wax center for almost 2 years in 3 different states
food was good but again we are talking about a buffet where the food sits under heat lamps
this place has all of what you need for your hair
i had a very rough night in vegas this past weekend and woke up feeling like i could not do anything
i have short nails and its a better option than a full set which can often damage your own nailshopefully it will prevent nail bitting lol  check this place out
three of us  ate at baby cakes
after multiple unpleasant experiences i called the shop and asked to speak to a manager who hung up the phone after i voiced my concerns
they look amazing for weeks i get compliments almost daily
there is a rather large glass fridge which is always a plus
its hard to find a barber shop that compares to vicks
and he literally laughed and said no
my first time here was as a walkin and i was told the wait would be about 20 min
close to ttc as well
the entire experience was wonderful
i came to marlyn after  going to another dominican salon in charlotte for about a year
when my mother said she didnt like it she was told youll get used to it
if you bring in a photo of a style you are looking for they will recreate it perfectly
my daughter is upset mom the car alarm is going off because i was getting out to come in to store and these people are yelling at me about being parked here
i highly recommend the expertise beauty and spa
2 stars because the guy who did my moms manipedi was so patient and nice but i cant see ever returning to this dimly lit salon at west towne
this is the 3rd time if been there at night to give them the benefit of the doubt and theyve sucked every single time
came in for a simple clean up of the sides and to thin out the top
he doesnt know how to give a simple cut
when it came time for the best part the massage its like she was a zombie
not going back and do not recommend
furthermore the life guard who was manning the tower wasnt really paying attention to the occupants of the pool
the hotel itself was really nice with a great pool
i had my first trial with her 4 months prior to my wedding as she was 8 months pregnant and was very impressed with her talents
she is great
what i found was a paw print and it pretty much seemed like a sign to me
im very impressed with this staff
short of a perm my hair has never been able to hold a curl or wave for more than about 30 minutes
2 the open bathroom is also feet from your bed think radisson so dont expect a lot of privacy
i see emme for monthly facials and use her products religiously and my skin is absolutely stunning luminous and not a bump or pimple in sight
then was told to have a seat in one of the chairs where you get the pedicure done
there werent many nail polish colors to choose from
they took me as i was getting up to walk out
i think it may be a while before i make it back there but only because with the new short hair its growing way faster and i cant afford 70 a month to maintain it
its about finding the style that works with a womans face and her life and personal style
he helped me in the photo dept
one word describes my experience  professional
this was my first time coming to this salon for a mens haircut and just wanted to say that jeff dillie is one of the best hair stylists i have ever been too
a very spacious waiting area she offered me water with a warm welcome
i do that wait a while and then the guy at the counter finds my 4x6 prints in the 8x10 box
however at aa after my treatment i still can see and make manylines in my forehead and still can make a scowling face
yes that happens quite a bit
i highly recommend vlashed
i was told tax and tip is not included
whats even more amazing is that they offer complimentary use of their spa
i probably got someone on a bad day based on all these other glowing reports
for the price you cant beat it on the strip
i feel as though every person who has done my makeup really listens to what type of look im going for and never pushes anything else on me
for some reason i agreed to pay but did not tip
she had an an attitude as if i was inconveniencing her by calling
he snapped at me to sign in
you dont find many stylist with the skills and personality to match
tina did my comp blowout today
i felt and looked amazing
at another place they made it a very painful experience and did not listen to what i asked for
i paid 79 and 25  but even at 150nt its a steal
lots of great energy
the workers there are super friendly and accommodating
b did my hair i had light brown ombre going on and i told her i just wanted an all over dark brown simple right
i always go here and love it
his bedside manners are amazing
anyway other than that it was an enjoyable stay
good friendly service sometimes they feel a bit uppity but i usually squash that quickly with my great charm
my therapist of choice is amanda
the last gel manicure i got turned out really well
so happy to have found my nail salon
the massage they gave was terrible
second two days after most of the lashes on my right eye where gone
after my first visit i was hooked
my wife now comes here too
all here are talented
it just makes the place look bad
i could have done better if i did it myself
i moved to ahwatukee and tried to find a new salon
she is personable and professional together in a  beautiful package
there are only 2 toilets in the womens locker area and 2 showersso i had to wait in line each time i needed either
but no seriously close that shop because yall hopeless
i keep my hair shortpixie so finding someone who is competent can be tough but he always does a good job
customer came in with a 10 dispute on a 65 service
i stopped in desperate for a cut and style after a great clips botch
then she told the assistant to apply a conditioning treatment which she didnt even know how to open
employee sits on moped in front of store waiting for customers
i bought a groupon for a full set of acrylic nails
by the way i think they use baby oil
ill definitely go back
however i must say my rockstar here is christine
it took ten minutes for us to even be acknowledged by anyone while standing at the podium albiet they were extremely busy for a sunday afternoon
it is well known for a lot of variations but overpriced
i also asked for a gel polish which was 10 extra
the hotel was filthy smelled bad
its part of my weekly routine nowthe staff are kind the change room and lounge are always clean and tidy even with a lot more people frequenting the spa now and most importantly the iyashi team always responds to feedback with an openmind and willingness to do more and do better for their clients
strong customer service and shares serious knowledge for understanding the best in hair care
i was quoted 45 and charged 70
this is who i wish to do business with
when i called to make an appointment they asked me my hair type which is somewhat curly and wavy depending on the day so they made my appointment with a stylist that cuts curly hair
i came to this location because i was in a hurry and i didnt want to drive all the way to the anthem location
eric did an outstanding job trimming and shaping my beard
should race but brought my mother in law and shes been waiting too
he did a fabulous job
its obvious that she is a very skilled aesthetician but its her warm and friendly personality that really puts you at ease immediately
walked in on a whim as my boyfriend needed a trim but wanted to go for something a little different
literally the worst tanning salon you could go to
i always leave here with a premium haircut
my nails are fabulous and they are holding up great
i kept asking him politely to stop yelling at me and he replied your husband was yelling at me what are you going to do about it
i am telling localsas well as tourists that you need to try this place out
the sound of the many fountains in the whirlpool area was so relaxing
the shop has that old skool feel with a new skool kut
very friendly staff and luxurious accommodations are just a couple of the wonderful qualities firesky offered
i was able to text my request for an appointment so simple
its not fancy
please note that there is a small fee for using the credit card
i also had the beginning of a migraine
i may just have to go in again before we leave for another service rather than risking it at the casinos
both times with priscila a beautiful brazilian girl shes amazing
i wanted a repeat
always natural and perfectly even
disclaimer  i have never had a blow out before
she does all the small stuff you beg for
i went in for my first tattoo after much research and couldnt be happier with my decision
amelia has got to be the best there is in vegas the best in nevadaheck the best in the us as far as im concerned
i did ask for more pressure and halfway through i said i give up and just felt uncomfortable being touched and couldnt relax
i highly recommend kaya elements and will definitely be back
i dont want to stick my feet in a tub that was only rinsed  that hundreds of feet have used yuck
andrea is professional caring and well trained
my husband gave it a whirl when it first opened
it also seems like someone told them to do this cause its so obvious someone would go out of their way and advertise for someone else i wouldnt be surprised if that diane person told her clients to do this for her just so everyone follows her to her new job
she then says she is going to call billing and let me know what they can do then says thanks and hang up
possible 5 stars here just got my new tattoo from jason
her work is incredible any idea you give her she creates a piece beyond anything you could imagine
but for 90pop for the massage and a spa u dont want to luxuriate in not worth it
they only showed up about 20 minutes late but it still would have been nice if they were on time since we were on such a tight schedule
unlike the trump we had a balcony which overlooked the pool and the backside of the strip
i love this place and refuse to go elsewhere
the massage was wonderful i felt so relaxed both mentally and physically
i had 3 wisdom teeth taken out at once and i am very happy with how the procedure went
as a loyal customer he became very complacent in terms of making recommendations he thought would look good on me
i probably wont be returning for a hair appointment
i think my problem is that i suck at calling ahead for an appointment so i have to work on that too
always does an awesome job
i used one of their beds and since they didnt ask me about my tanning past i was in there a little too long and wound up getting the worst sunburn of my life
she basically took off my nail polish and shellaced over
she charged me 10 for take off and 18 for mani
we have our appointment set with them for next week and got to meet a couple of them
he can visit you right at your home or office and be brings everything with him
also you cannot book more than one session at a time  so if you are treating multiple areas things can get difficult
jenny was friendly and professional
the music and atmosphere are very relaxing as well and i look forward to my next henna appointment
thats the nature of their business to try and get more customers covered
the buttons on the massage remote control were all there  not faded worn or broken
the quality and service is great
i cant imagine having my eyebrows done by anyone else
bridgett made an excuse for her said she was a teacher and she had kids
tannis told me that she could not leave a message for my therapist maryanna and that i could call back monday if i wanted to get ahold of her
i have told many of my friends already and will spread the word of my terrible experience
my hair is always amazing and is always healthy
shes got water and tea for you while youre styled and a comfortable little salon
im originally from the detroit area and in my 4 years living here this place comes closest to there
i was going to this other salon in town in which id lose up to 3 nails in between fills waited the typical 2 weeks max
best 20 full body one hour massage ive ever had
specially girl at the receptionshe just never smilesor maybe just to me which is still not good if you work with people and charge that much for services
she warned me that they charge customers 50 of the service if you are late so i made sure to leave very early for the location with the hope to relax in the waiting area with the aforementioned water and snacks prior to the massage
ive always loved every visit here
though they were friendly clean and professional i was not too happy with how the spray tan came out
maybe they got kick out of the adult pool
im going to be going back to him for my second tattoo and many more after that
im serious when i say that this is the best place ive ever stayed at
took her time and did not rush
i arrived and there was no wait
i really dont need or want a stylist or any other frills
so i called sadie to say i can still make my 10 am appointment if you call me back and tell me the new address the new address was not given to the office staff
when i went in for my vch piercing he jerry was blunt told my cousin to shut up she is annoying but i paid over 80 for him to look at my vagina and poke a hole through my flesh mmmkay
my appointment got delayed because he was busy doing other things
so glad i stumbled across this place
we will definitely recommend him to our friends
they rubbed my legs with a slice of orange
give a try it will be worth it
as a lady i dont trust my hair to just any barber but aaron did an excellent job and didnt chop off my good hair
save your money and nails do not go here
i get to the register and the discount wasnt half off
it was nice chatting with her and she even accommodated my no poo  the fact that i dont wash my hair with shampooconditioner
this place is fantastic
i than asked how did that happen
terrible inexperienced lazy not knowing the body at all
well i cannot hold it from you sarah was her name and when i proposed after there was no responce but trust me she was incredible
frankly it made me feel pretty special
atmosphere is party like with big open space and good music playing
they did a fantastic job on all but make up was really on point
from the moment i walked in i was greeted with a smile
very nice spa it was exactly what i was looking for
she is a magician of hair
it was about 5 mins long and it felt great
she did not apply any primer or set the makeup the eye make up was horrible
i stopped in here to see if they could squeeze me in before their 7pm closing time
but beware that the offers presented when you check in on yelp are often not honored which is false advertising and is slowly pushing me to stop going here
i actually really loved this location and will be taking my young daughter with me for a pedicure next
i went in to actually have a guitar repair done and was immediately impressed by how cool the vibe of the place was
coffee were okay the sitting space is cozy and cute
what is keeping me from a 5star rating 1 the membership prices are quite steep and 2 the classes tend to get really crowded and require you to get there 30 mins prior to get a decent spot
she provided great conversation and a seamless back waxing which for some guys can be brutal
i dont even know where to begin
since the first time coming here its difficult to go anywhere else
had all of my girls nails done here and theyre just perfect
besides her awesome skills shell keeping you laughing and engaged the whole appointment
when i called jan back to see if she could see me to lighten up my hair more she gave me a flat out no
then i spoke with napoleon id 4699 who put me on hold to check how he could help me but it seemed like he just had me on hold because he didnt want to hear about the terrible customer service i had encountered already
he really does a great and very thorough job at a reasonable price
are you kidding me
i havent entered this place in over a year but i was willing to go back once more and try the nail salon they have inside
my stylist was evelyn and she was so helpful i went in not knowing what i wanted and she was very good on suggestions
the express services are basic and start around 15
she gave me a recommendation that which choices would be appropriate for me
i always get my eyebrows waxed but i never had any issues just yesterday
this place is a sad excuse for a barber shop
guess i am spoiled by marriott accommodations
my nails were very clean and i loved how she shaped them
its an excellent convenient location downtown with other locations around the city
clean good sized and hip
i was never asked one question besides what i want done to my hair and when i would bring up conversation i was met with short replies
the last time i was there the lady was trying to push back my cuticles with an instrument that wasnt a cuticle pusher
emily who is the manager i believe cut my hair
i spent 150 tips included
they set me up with brenda
i was told this would be 5 extra never was before but i need it cool
its worth the drive
ive been coming here since they opened in december 2016  love the salon but mostly my nails  pedi
she does a great job at breaking up the knots and helping to alleviate the pain from working at a desk being in meetings all day and doing homework all night
i got a tragus piercing and the piercer was super sweet and made me feel comfortable
the owner said well i guess i can do it for you if you want as if she was doing me some kind of favor that i didnt even ask for
i went to carolyns for the first time recently
or  was it
i did use a groupon and for the price i paid she did a more than wonderful job
air conditioner was off and front and back doors were open
i did botox with dahl as well and she understood my previous experiences and fulfilled my needs perfectly
she has a gentle soothing touch even while waxing
for sure my go to in vegas
she is amazing every time from cut to color and its the first time that ive been to a stylist where i didnt feel like i had to go home and restyle my hair
just walked in and found my favorite girl apple thats used to work at another spot i want to for a while
he not only transformed my lifeless curls but he educated me on how to handle my curls for less frizz and breakage
however in doing so you know the room rates will be higher
turns out she has ripped a 2 inch wide gash in my leg
i have been getting brazilian blowouts for about 2 years now
funny she wants to make her own rules
place is clean and quiet
came here on a last minute quest after buffet at bellagio for a party of three
miki i hope i spelled it right was taking care of me she did a wonderful job with my hair and im very very happy
this was my first time at this salon and will not be my last time either
the guy was very nice but very slow and my nails look ok  the salon smelled like cigarette smoke as they went outside to smoke in the back
the sisters have a lot of experience and provide a comfortable environment
i covered it with a baseball cap and went to another salon
i cant stress enough how comfortable she makes you feel
ashley did my full set and its safe say she is quite the perfectionist she takes her time and is meticulous making sure your lashes look perfect
my husband goes to this barber chuck and each time he comes away super impressed with the haircuts
not going back
the rest of the staff was helpful though my interaction with them was minimal
perhaps if they just update their facilities they will have enough business and not have to sell their lotions and vitamins to make money
i cant stay anything about the nails services but im sure they do a great job as they are always busy
anything you dream of she turns it into reality
love this salon
i went in for the first time today for a pedicure and gel manicure
thats helpful during the hot summer days with kid and stroller
i must say that i was happy with this service
i had been going here for years and was a good client and then made the mistake of having sue ha do my highlights after nick tried to repair the damage my hair went orange and is fried and when i asked for refund they refused and even said i would have to pay for future highlights saying they could give me complimentary treatments no thanks
she went a little at a time as she wanted me to be comfortable
man what if i got stuck in the middle of nowhere with no battery
ask for emil he will hook you up
but the way nicky phrased it was a little rude and insulting
both of our pieces came out awesome
i needed major eyebrow help
i said i dont know  but it was clippers on the sides and scissors on top
very accommodating and professional nail salon
maybe because shes a bit older and there isnt much conversation to do lol
check it out
deshalb haben wir die versandkosten von ihrer rechnung 032405300 021 abgezogen
she accepted feedback when i asked her to change a few things and she was open to feedback
there was no thank you kiss my ass nothing at the end of our service and the receptionist seemed more confrontational than anything
also im not sexist by any meansbut two of the employees are menwho quite frankly dont have a creative side so to speak
also i asked for nini based on what i have seen
the bumps are deep in the skin and are painful and hard
whether i keep the buzz or not i feel like i have one now
loved sarah she was patient and kind
first off  understand that they are corporately owned which makes a huge difference in the way any issues that come up are handled and the bulbs in their beds are rarely changed to my experience
cami was professional and made sure that i was comfortable at all times
this is my usual spot to get my nails done
recommending major to anyone and everyone looking for a barber
service was also terrible
thats not the vibe here and i can definitely appreciate that
the haircut and wash was finished in under 2030 minutes
the entire time i could hear the employees entire conversations the dryers in the backroom and the heating system
other than that its the usual stuff that most day spas have  steam sauna jacuzzi dry sauna
definitely recommend i couldnt be happier
i assume this place got so many good ratings thanks to the insentive of a 10 discount dark red gel manicure applied by the gentleman with long pointy fingernails ended up blotchy and looking messy
time for me to find another salon
i dont get my hair died often and i told her i was excited to make my look a little edgier going into the new year
im sure that all the staff that works here deserves to get all the stars
my favorite thing was the raw oyster bar
i would certainly recommend annex family chiropractic to anyone seeking long term permanent results and a more natural approach to their health
she also did not clean underneath my nail and since it was very clear you could see all the dirt
i had my eyebrow pencil on
came to vegas for a concert a day before i was coming out my shoulder started to hurt by the time i got to vegas my shoulder was killing me i couldnt even sit still
they are very accommodating and the product smell and feel natural
i only had to wait about 5min before i was taken downstairs and the bed was heated
i have never experienced a massage this bad and ive had massages all over the country
i recommend it  will be back
i made an appointment and was well accommodated by the person who took my information
the salon is decorated really nice and all the staff was very friendly
i have been a member for  2years
at this point she looked directly in my face and walked off
she exudes professionalism and it was apparent from the initial consultation that she cares deeply about her patients
so this time i will begin with the 5 senses review then get into the all the words
i love float
so she cut them like crazy which i thought would help but her technique was choppy and she did not know how to do it right
very great service got a full set acrylic with chrome powder and coffin shape turned out absolutely gorgeous
i have used them a few times as a gift for people and every time i am completely happy with the assistance i get
he is not only very nice but he does his job right
they are just right for summer  jenny is very nice and experienced
i was glad to grab an appointment and arrived early
ask for bena
mai was pleasant professional and i adore her perfection with details
i let her know that as a new client i had no idea what time frame they require for appointments but thought it was worth a try
everyone is always nice and courteous
it took me several years to find salon
i wish i lived in scottsdale so i could go all the time
allie is the most knowledgeable waxer
it was a sad disappointment thats for sure
went there today and did not have an appointment
i would definitely go back
honestly the best hair cut i have ever received
anyway it was a journey to get from the hotel to the strip as other reviewers have stated
this was my first experience with this studio and it was great
two small problems steam room and paymentstips
the manager kept stressing out the other employees including me the customer
the 90s jams lowly played in the background
i tried to make an appointment on mothers day on mothers day and of course they were booked
a very nice gentleman followed me and asked to look at the find my iphone  looking to see where the phone was he helped me look for a bit and then checked with security  someone had turned in my entire bag
i like to see myself in the buff of my nails and will tip generously to a tech that will spend the time to make them shine but 12 hours later my buff is matte and that is being kind
the salon manages to be modern and trendy without giving off that snobby vibe other salons do
jenn gave me the best cut and color i have ever had
i went here because a friend recommended it though she went to the downtown location thought id try this place coz its closer to me also i got a good deal through a website
its hard to find someone you trust and i feel like i could trust gina blindfolded
the girl i came here with opted for almond shaped acrylic nails and while hers too looked good she had to have them removed the very next day  because she was in so much pain from her nails being oversanded
i hope some of you try another nail tech in the future so that you might experience a great set
shortly after she had to trim another line because that one was messed up so badly
i also do not feel they are pushy but i already have a membership
design could of been more clean
the most natural transformation
this place has friendly and qualified staff fair prices a cool environment and great hair products their house brand is choice
sophia is the best
cant wait to go back
loved my service would definitely go there again
came in for a gel set and got exactly what i wanted
barely felt the 30 second massage had to ask for more pressure
i went to the appt with no ideas the only thing i knew was that i wanted highlights and a haircut to get rid of all of my dead ends
mai the owner pick up the call and gave us the appointment when my sister show up saying that she has an appointment with tina  but mai just tell my sister to come in sit in the stylish chair
i was concerned about my visit taking too long but it was only 1 and 12 hours
only wish they were in california where were from
they actually look quite natural  oh so purdy
she also waxed my eyebrows too
when he took off the cotton he used the electric file
im a student living on campus so its the most convenient nail salon in terms of location and their prices are pretty good i paid 17 dollars for the fill itself and 3 dollars for them to be shortened  tip
please provide better training to your staff
i picked out a color and the nail tech got started
i hate when people price gauge as they generally do in vegas
sometimes its as much as forty
its probably my bad that i didnt mention something to the receptionist about my nails smudging
a true gem to the community
the restaurant on site kilwat was our goto for breakfast as well as lunch by the pool
i used to like this place but it seems like the ateam went elsewhere
heck my boyfriend gives better massages than this
he argued with me about the difference between almond and stiletto nails
as im sitting here enjoying my 10 minute foot and leg massage consistent service every time i come
no apology nothing
very unsatisfactory overall
she was wonderful
it was easy to make an appointment
the new staff is inconsistent
the lady that helped me bea was delightful and has very gentle but strong hands which made for an amazing sea salt scrub massage
i love supporting local businesses so i found reflecting hands massage through the internet
how often does this happen
my son gave me a gift certificate from here to have a manipedi
ive had two experiences with him and both have been completely awful
work is great
she seriously blew me away with how great of a job she did on them
if i move from ballantyne i will still go to them
i told her i work an hour from the store and that would not be an option
the polish is considered gel but its very light
she always exceeds my expectations
thats 4 a strip
i looked fabulous
i get my hair  eyelashes done there  i love it
i visited a the shops in san diego and didnt like what i saw
i saw only about 5 other women wandering and relaxing here and there
horrible hair cut by their so called master stylist
after a bit of reading i look up and see how short she had cut my hair
she has a relaxed energy and and kind heart
my nails literally started to lift and come off and when i text the pictures to said nail tech she told me she was booked and couldnt fit me in
i got my nails done on sunday
i should have kept driving
dr haggard is the best
im usually a bit skeptical of going anywhere for a wax but im really glad i came here
their chairs are super comfy and they do an amazing job on your nails
she really took her time cutting my hair which i really liked and my hair turned out really great
it works way quicker than botox and lasts longer too
popped in impromptu while shopping and they were able to squeeze a friend and me in very quickly
this location is the closest to my home but does not seem to have its act together in the pharmacy
i dont know if she did this out of spite or out of sheer incompetence
dont get be wrong it kills at the time but its worth it in the end
i still cant believe im sitting there
my brother had a large piece done on his shoulder and trip was great as well and his tattoo looks great
in all of the years of getting my nails done this gel manicure and pedicure rank as top ten
great burgers with lots of options
next time i call if i get an attitude ill be sure to get her name
they have been the bane of my existence since i was a child
lisa does my eybrows and does an excellent job for 15
he transformed my hair from middle age mediocre to absolutely amazing
i enjoyed my first time there and i just know i will be visiting frequently
jaycie did an amazing job giving me a nice even airbrushed tan
haircut was 25 and i tipped the guy 10 for a great cut
reminded me of a cheap chain hotel but with another name
lifetime has free childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming
the groupon is not worth it
i had a haircut and highlights done by jeremy today
by far the worst nail salon ive ever been to in vegas
i have seen him twice and have had 4 procedures done and am beyond happy with my results
men haircuts are 10 while women range from 1525 for different lengths
i came to try their 39 special massage for 1st time customers and to see how their waxing services are dannielli the queen of waxing was on holiday
we got up to leave and they didnt care
one daughter had hair slightly past her shoulders and just wanted a trim and the other had hair above her shoulders and wanted a fun angled cut ending around her chin on one side
the bathhouse as a whole has some flaws
em tanning queen
very friendly staff
he was rude and not gentle
went to the hotel to see if we were lucky enough to check in early
i decided to finally write a review after about 5 visits
loved the  final look too
message me if you need any other kind of reassurance
i bought the combo massage and reflexology
today i was going to an event unexpectedly and didnt have time to drive out to legacy and rauns was booked so i gave nail lacquer a shot
it is a small place tucked at the end of the plaza
they make you feel so comfortable and try to minimize the pain
thank you for consistently providing quality in the services and products you provide to your clients
i bought a livingsocial groupon earlier in the year intending to save it for after the hell that is restaurant week
ive only ever had one issue with the pharmacy but no ones perfect
a true pleasure to work with trish and dr aspacio
she even went through the lightening process twice
i absolutely love them theyre gorgeous and so natural looking
i chose this hotel based upon reviews and im disappointed
it is always the little things that impress the most and my husband will agree that their soap and towels are amazing
as i wanted 90min massage and my usual place was closing in a hour i decided to give magnolia a try
wife and i stayed here when we were looking for an apartment during our relocation to vegas
everyone is helpful and very patient
i came in for my touch up and asked again to thicken the tail of my brow and once again she thickened it but i couldnt really tell the difference
quinn is an excellent artist with her hand painted nail designs
2 not sure if she is still there but carlie the receptionist was extremely helpful and made me feel comfortable from pre surgery to laser treatments
thats why i love this great little salon on coventry
they are still significantly there in rectangular lighter patches
now i understand sometimes there will be men in a salon but the doors here are frosted i had nothing to cover myself with and i was shocked that men were allowed to walk near the waxing rooms
i also came on a monday and it was convenient that it was open at that time when most barber shops are closed or have limited hours
it was handled professionally and im excited to use the money i was given back for more tattoos
poor service and cheap material never going back to this place again
at vdara you can live like a movie star in quiet seclusion until youre ready for your closeup
never had a bad cut
the only person that ever has acknowledged me in a friendly way is security he should give the others a lesson on customer service
also every time i go there i am meeting different dermatologist each one of them have their own theories and opinions they do not agree with previous dermatologist and i have had lots of issues because of this
i believe my manicurist name was taylor pedicure was devi and moms was ivy
this is a nice little salon clean quick and they do a great job
she still didnt respond
30 for a wash cut and style
she was so sweet and the massage was amazing
after a few minutes when it was clear that she was in no shape to finish a haircut and refused to reenter the shop the father came over and finished the haircut
i showed ashley a picture of a hair cut i found in a hair style book that i bought a few years ago
she took the time to talk to me to make sure she understood what i wanted
54 for both with a 10 discount 10 tip for a total of 64
1 star  expensive 1 star  soso service i was glad to have experienced a day spa in vegas but id rather stick to my local spa that offers exceptional services for a good price
it is always nice to have friendly talented people to return to
so lovely
ill definitely be back now that i know its a thing
basically i m stuck cause i have paid the money but please dont waste your time or money here
brittney is the best
there was so much clarity to things happening in my life that i questioned and she stopped me from possibly making a horrible decision
once your therapist picks you up the real part of your journey begins
he was having issues with his nail file and seemed to take it out on my nails causing my finger to bleed a few times
on my second session i came in and from the start i told her i dont want my hair different colors from the black and the hair dye she previously did
they have no accommodations for nursing mothers
my otherwise enjoyable massage was tainted by largely avoidable issues
i look forward to my appointment all week long
it isnt the extra cost of buying your own but rather the fact that you must order in advance and pay that irks me
i went to jantra because two of my close friends go to her
request for van toyota
im new to tattooing and they obviously take advantage of someone new to the field
i wouldnt say to never go here because this is where i usually go but i expected better work done
ive gotten about 30 brazilians in my life and this was the worst she pulled so agonizingly slow and told me it was to get all the hairs
my technicians were jenny and david and i loved them both
a lot of products but not a great selection
i will definitely be going back to see her
excellent service very accomodating even for last minute appointments for her faithful clients
good equipment though
im pretty sure i wont be back
meghan is fashion forward and very creative with out making you look like someone you are not this lady has taste
every time i come here i have amazing service
just a full highlight
the worst  salon in vegas
count me in
lissa has been my artist for the ink on both of my arms  great work and will continue with her as long as shes available
we both got french tips on our toes which looked awesome and very neat
im glad i live so close and ill keep coming back
gloved up with new plastic wrap on the table and her chairs arm rests with lots of spraying of cleaning stuff before she began i felt secure knowing that infection was highly unlikely
beautiful shop very comfortable seats and great nail art
its modern pleasantlooking and everything seems tidy there
its hard to find a good barber in arizona back home in nj there all over
the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable hair artists
they said sure come at 12  got here at 12 and they said they cant do them both at the same time
as soon as i got here i started asking women who had really nice pink  whites where they got them done
definitely going to treat myself again im now a perry monge convert
so earlier last month danelle cut my hair and left it in a way so i can go grow out my hair
he has cut both my hair and my better halfs hair for a total of 3 visits thus far
again my monies and credit will be used somewhere else
im sure her background in microbiology helps
he said the esthetician will be coming around noon and if i can come back to get my microneedling done
i have been going to k land nails for 6 years
soroush was very honest with what my hair needed and what style would look good on me
hardest working man in the business
anyways long story short
id still be happy if i only had to wait 1520 min
instead of snowing the suds built up in the tube on the ceiling until they oozed out like a big foamy poop
it was worth 5 stars then rachel and gaby were both fantastic until the end
not only were the customers happy but the artists were happy
we highly recommend finding another dermatologist office
cashier is not the brightest i asked her do you accept apple pay
i travel a lot for work and my schedule is pretty hectic so i am always a walkin wherever i go
molly is an incredible stylist
he truly listened to exactly what i wanted and did exactly as i asked but made it look even better than i had pictured it in my head
his reply to our questions although probably repetitive and lame to him were sincere and important to us
someone finally came sat down and started doing my pedicure
everything seemed fine as the artist did my gfs tat
however we have noticed the quality of service diminish over the last few years and tonight it has taken a significant  downturn
ive been using her toner serum oil cleanser and mask religiously
why would you leave a dissatisfied client out front and make her feel a fool
they were able to get me in for their last appointment beginning at 815 pm
i also got a gel mani with my mom the day before the wedding and even though i specifically booked for 2 of us well in advance we ended up waiting for over 30 minutes which was a big inconvenience because my dad was stuck at my condo alone
if youre a real guy looking for a great haircut kast iron is it
to begin the only reason theyre receiving a single star is because you cant submit with no stars
some of the pros of the hotel is that the air is infused with some kind of scent but i guess its bad for the guests who want a substance free feel
im the pickiest girl of all time ive been going to jared at yolandas for almost 2years
i felt a little weird because i didnt know there wasnt shoes provided you walk around barefoot if you dont bring flip flops but other than that it was a great massage and experience
came here with my sister as she was trying to get a foundation but wasnt sure of what color she would be the lady helping us just kept insulting her and making my sister feel bad about herself
a very positive experience
the shading is spectacular so much more than what we expected
ladies and gentlemen if you are like me and dont love all your body hair this is the place for you
where it gets worse i asked to speak to a manager ya i was that lady
i went through the website and read the doctor bios and decided it was close to home and everyone looked friendly and unintimidating
i think it took 30  40 minutes to finish the first cutting
actually they advised that i sit and think about it for a while because they wanted me to be 100 positive with my decision
the lounge area is so comfortable and relaxing  selections of water tea coffee snacks and fruitthe chairs were sink in and doze off comfortable
i said no the polish is fine its the techniqueyoure not doing it evenly
ich war zweimal im braidingatelier das erste mal war noch ok die strhnen haben gehoben und fr 250 euro konnte man nicht meckern
since then i dont think ive been anywhere else to get a haircut
3 exceptional customer service  all staff consistently put a lot of effort into your hair
he and his staff made me feel very welcome comfortable and explained everything to me in great detail
only person i trust with my blonde hair
i did think it was strange because shes never done this before at her other salon
i even decided to go ahead and buy the wax package of buying 6 and getting one free
i absolutely adore this place
definitely worth it to come see her and get something especially blended just for you
ive had various treatments at body solutions and ive been happy with the everyone and the treatment
all my life i felt that as i had shortstubby fingers with shortstubby fingernails to match what was the point in paying somebody to slap some varnish on it when i could do it myself
ive had some that treat me as though im not even there and yes they are cutting my hair
i unfortunately wont be back because the masseuses are not experienced in what they are assigned to do
i will definitely check that out on my next visit
its not that i enjoy telling her to fix the mistakes
i did sign up for a hot yogarock bathing combo in early may and i am looking forward to that
the entire staff is very accommodating
just found my new favorite nail salon and would recommend highly to anyone who asks
samples of peach champagne en route to our room
they also offer organic facials and eye lash extensions
i asked if they accepted walk ins and he directed me to the polish wall
lori is knowledgeable in not just botox but other  rejuvenating products
compared to la and chicago our towns however it was reasonable for us
the job on my my nails seemed average
i travel a lot for work and this is a great place
ann advised me that the color i chose wouldnt pop as much and helped me find another nude color
please go see jessica at the luxxi salon
dr fisher did a wonderful job
theyre very knowledgeable and friendly
from my wife you know that panic you feel when your hair dresser tells you shes leaving the state
2nd time getting pedi and i love it and the regular polish usually stays on a while
first of all the prices are amazing i bought remy hair extensions and i could not be more happy
she tried to finish as fast as possible then had to correct 2 nails and she hurt my nails meanhwile filing
my husband met the owners at a first friday event months ago and then we just happened to walk by
i live just around 1015 min away so i thought this could be my prospective regular nail salon
her equipment came straight from under uv cleaning which i truly am thrilled to see they have  use
her touch during treatment is amazing
qua is awesome its very clean and the amenities are aplenty
thank you joey
brent does an amazing job with fades as well as highlights
i felt like i still looked somewhat natural but just enhanced if that makes sense
renee at the studio is the best stylist ever
as a frequent massage goer this is hands down one of the best massages ive received
my family and i will definitely stay loyal customers
i was extremely furious but given my inherent kind and calm demeanor i swallowed a globus pharingys seething with rage and resentment and slapped a smile on my face so to speak
i came in at 6 one day to get a pedicure and i was turned away because all five employees that were sitting there watching tv decided they were going home early that day and didnt want to take me
once all was said and done my hair was very dark and it was extremely hard to see the different colors in my hair
the location is great and easy to see from scottsdale road plus there is plenty of parking
akriveia salon is a cool private boutique salon run by anissa who is one of the sweetest funnest and most genuine people in the business
i was told to come back another day because nothing could be done for me so i went back the next day to see layla
cant wait to have this experience again
i havent been back since and i will not go back
i asked for a man because i needed someone to really get in there and work on me
i just got my first tattoo here and im really pleased with how it turned out and the experience i had at pearl harbour
i was really excited to check this place out after reading all the glowing reviews but ended up being super disappointed with my experience
finally a place i can get my hair cut every other week without paying way too much
my nails were fine when she finished but it was just horrible customer service theres a way to give a customer your honest opinion without coming off rude
will continue to keep going back time after time
first of all the last thing i want to do is to stare at someone elses boobs for 60 min because the shirt she wears is 2 sizes to small so big negative second no one explained how the hole pick your up grades works and no prices anywhere and not even the nail tech knew the prices so big negative she didnt look at me once while she did my nailsshe kept moving my fingers around without saying a word
they teach you about how sugaring works and are very keen to make sure you know aftercare routines to get the best results from your hair removal
the vichi body scrub however was miserable
i love this school
you get the same quality but less of the headache and much friendlier service
mya is wonderful
its so calm and relaxing
the only problem that i have is when i go in caucasian associates that help me always have a problem with matching my skin complexion to the correct foundation color
yes its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for here
shes very efficient and takes her time
the salon was lucky that i had nowhere to be that day otherwise i would have been raising hell
my husband and i came in for walkin tattoos and we could be more impressed
we were not sure where to go to get our 4 year olds ears pierced
good barbers and friendly service
after tax tip and the 10 off coupon my total was almost 80
but i wrote it because the level of customer service from the desk lady was really that bad
apparently he had a problem with it
sorry you were having a bad day lady
cleanliness is top on my list
steam room this room is hot and super misty
thank goodness for a large hat collection
ive been twice
i initially only came for upper eyelid surgery and dr caniglia suggested a forehead lift for better results
tried this place out after reading reviews here on yelpand the people are correct
amazing prices and services
no one was there at 10am on a friday so i had the area to myself
i recommend this place to everyone
kaylee did an awesome job
would i recommend them if someone i cared about was thinking of getting something done here in the clevo area
i was sick that day and couldnt blow dry for myself so i had to go to the salon
i will drive out of my way to patronize this business
the pool is awesome cabanas were great room was cool and clean
i am a massage therapist of 11 years and very picky about massages
they kept speaking in their language and laughing right in front of the customers

any sort of discount at the only place inside the property to get food drinks etc
my daughter and i spent last sunday afternoon here and it was a heavenly experience
okay so first off this review is not coming from one person it is coming from four
easy to make an appointment plenty free parking was seen right on time the supervisors came regularly and i had a very good student i will add her name when i go back
i highly recommend you stop by
why would they not just put this on your players card
the best news is rose is the owner of classy nails so you know you are going to be treated royally
they gave me a discount price of 90
sometimes they will trim the hairs and pluck any strays other times you will get someone who only waxes and thats it
inquire within store for full information
ive been hk hair designs loyal customer since i was a toddler before they moved to their current location and ive had some great and some bad experiences with them
the only advice i can give you is this  either tell them you were recommended here by a friend who is regular here or prepare to develop a more personal relationship with your beauticians over a few expensive
made me feel at home
thats a joke
she was very professional and gave great ideas for color and cuts
the man owner
ive been trying to find a classic barber in charlotte and this place is it
we showed her some pictures and she was completely confident that she could achieve that look
i highly recommend this place
i also liked that she told me how much it would be before starting being my first time in the salon
at first my moh wanted only her hair done but once they came and she saw alanas work she decided to have her do her makeup as well as
we asked for a food comp and told no
she has done bridal makeup for almost every person i know including myself
you can only go in person to cancel the membership
so the whole pamper yourself thing i never did
she looks at me in shock and yells you want oil
the place was somewhat messy and looked like not much effort was put into upkeeping its image
the main dude

they were always so professional and caring
she took her time and she was also very kind
fast and grateful to talk to
i brought in some that i loved as reference but they wont apply lashes you dont buy from them
both my mom and sister had a great experience with phoenix and terry
i will definitely be back
after i had made my purchase  asked to speak with her and told her how she made me feel
it was delicious
so i am writing this review as a colleague of stacy
four of my toes had chipped within the first 3 days wasnt doing anything out of the ordinary
if you are in the mesagilbert area give arizona hair co a try and ask for erika if you can
she listened and gave me a cut and style that was better than i expected
i would highly recommend this place to all
even her work wasnt fantastic but i was willing to work with her  you know give her some time and tips
i was in vegas the latter part of april 2011 for a trade show and between the constant walking classes and an already aggravated shoulder i was in pain and miserable by the last day of the event
i got a partial foil treatment from jecika and am very happy with how it turned out
she definitely keeps up with me wanting to constantly change up my hair and i can say i honestly love everything she does and she keeps it healthy
oh no according to this woman natalie is not a child kid or toddler
it made me really uncomfortable
regret doing it
and i was going for a natural all over warm color with a baylage ombre in it
rexs wifey is surely one lucky lady
i found it odd that while its a health oriented place their store in the east end sold refined and processed food
while i was under the dryer pang took another client who had a dance that night
shes good at applying them and its really relaxing
my membership is 59 dollars a month at first i thought that it was way too much thats 3 months at another gym but i soon realized that it is well worth it
ive found that leaving my appointments feels like i just left a spa
i am already looking forward to my next appointment and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for not only a good stylist but a better alternative to the harsh abrasive chemicals that normally go into hair color processes
easily my favourite spot to get a hair cut
he communicated with him knew the spots and focused on what was needed
i have been going to see mai for 2 years now and i have to say she is amazing
ultimately i left feeling like there was more to be desired and i definitely dont feel as polished as i was hoping to feel
my sister got married at the bellagio and was forced to use them for everything
she definitely listened and focused on those muscles
should you need makeup fragrance hair care products sephora should be top of your list
doris did my hair for my wedding and her daughter did my makeup  love this place
message to owner keep the current price point
he said i have to get passport pics taken by them for 12
this is a family owned business from what my artist told me
note the nail art is a tad on the sloppy side
kundenfreundlichkeit lsst wirklich zu wnschen brig
i didnt have any issue at all with scheduling or parking and while efficient the front desk staff were friendly and polite enough despite some other reviewers experiences
got a couples suite and there were no extra touches champagne etc as mentioned by other patrons
michael boychuck celebrity stylist has staffed his salon with the absolute best in the city
chantel is awesome
i would not go here i would not recommend it to anyone that wants a nice client centric spa
if youre asian and used to getting your haircuts with asian styling  avoid at all costs
just moved to the area let me first start by saying im a nail snob
also she does great work
the staff is not trained at all and clueless
i was frustrated both times but after finding vivian i havent gone through it again
i didnt care for that
wurden alle umgesetzt
when i first met her i had a terrible hair cut and some version of orange and i think even green colors in my hair
she also taught me how to style it and blow dry it so i could keep the shape
her work is purely phenomenal just look through her instagram pictures are worth a thousand words
i was searching for a place that provided the vi peel and i found no lines
id rather pay more for a salon that answers their phones
i called eli the next day and told me he will fix my hair i have to pay another 50
i am very pleased and would highly recommend this office and dr trent to everyone i know
so glad i found her
klassy nails and spa is a 2 thumbs up 10 out of 10 you will not be disappointed
personal was nice though
4 please do i have never heard that prices are higher per pounds in larger quantities

was looking for a nail salon i just moved to this side if town and this was the closest salon toy new house
you need the special goggles for the tanning beds to protect your eyes and the tanning lotion is recommended although i didnt have to pay for that since the bf had some its definitely pricier than coppertone
one moment he is funny and cracking jokes next minute he looks so miserable
i have done my facials with them for over 10 months and my skin was much better since i come here
nice chair with great massage
see you soon
i happened to just walk into pink cherry because i was meeting my friend at serenade that day
you dont feel like youre in the phoenix desert
ive been to annie color and style and paula cut and would feel comfortable going to any of the other girls there from what ive seen
seemed like a great place and i walked out looking very spiffy with a stylish cut and new highlights that appeared well done
the lady who cut my hair was extremely friendly and from st louis
he really helped me work out some kinks and told me why i had these pains and was also helpful kind and friendly
go see her
em beauty bar has become my new goto
then i showed him a picture of how i would like my hair done i wanted my hair to have an ombre so dark on the top and gradually get lighter and l had a picture that i showed him of exactly how i wanted it
my coworker went there to get her nails done before and she said that they used foil on her finger tips

great place to detoxify after a drunken party weekend in vegas
ammenities this is a new resort with a nice large pool area and a bar that sells overpriced grill food
i recently purchased and redeemed a voucher for 80minute reflexology massage from marys shiatsu from living social
i had dye everywhere
i am a runner and my feet get pretty beaten up
loved staying here
the cleaning staff are in your face entering the steam rooms locker rooms wiping something right in front of you when you dry your hair taking your robe away while you stand right next to your lounger and try finding you towel and robe on the hooks  if they are all exactly the same
i highly recommend gentle laser
i truly wanted to be able to give a 5 star review for the hotel but i just cant do it
so happy to have found this place
this is a good barber shop but its not the place to go if you have and want to keep your hair a bit longer
my face looks fantastic per usual thanks allison
everyone is so friendly and there is great conversation and you can clearly understand
a series of competent trainers especially the trainer i have had the longest fran mamerelli
felt comfortable in rays chair and recommend him anyone in town for a cut
i thought it was a decent deal
pretty much can flush a doxin puppy in one go
i was so impressed
shes very good with nail art def will be coming back
i cant see myself coming back
i had read that they had poor reviews but whatever i wanted to try it for myself as they are practically in my backyard
best way to release the stress and aches
we changed in a small locker room secured our valuables and got into our fluffy white robes
i had an after work evening appointment so i was pretty exhausted
of the 40 minutes of work i received only the foot portion was pleasant
i am so glad we went somewhere else and were treated with the respect we deserved
however i do have reservations about the salon
the prices are so affordable the whole staff were so welcoming and gave me great customer service
my entire drive home consisted of me cardancing to 1047 aside from the great service cut color and renewed faith in salons i had a fantastic experience and cant wait to come back
this was a relaxing foot massage which i really neded
are you joking
i will be back
i first met laura when she worked at the brow lady in scottsdale  and from that appointment i knew my brows  i would follow her wherever she went
i have come here three times now for full sets and a pedicure
the salon setting is great plenty of parking and they not only took care of me with beverages but made sure my tagalong 7 year old was well cared for too
letty is great
way to damn much for a poorly done job on my nails
we love you lifetime
the hours are perfect for anyones schedule
i think that to establish good customer service that this was the mistake of the nail tech who works there and who should know what the prices are
but it got very strange when the lady getting a manicure behind me was complaining that her neck hurt
they are running scam just they will fool you
the selection is absolute vast
now the salon is clean and well lit and very easy to find
i needed a haircut badly and i was nervous to try a new stylist
she put in good effort and i appreciate that
very sloppy too fast literally done in 15 mins not friendly at all  just all around bad
or you can walk the 5 minutes to the mgm pool with the lazy river
it was easy to chat with her
whatever the reason this did not look like the picture at all
we had a major monsoon today and many people stayed home plus its monday plus i came during a slow part of the day
they dont exchange or return
i took my 13 year old niece to get mine and get nails done
love coming back here
the above address is incorrect
they arrived right on time and not a minute late which could always be neverwracking on your wedding day
im in love with my new hair
i thought i was going to have to live with my acne for the rest of my life and that it was something that i would have to learn to accept  but not anymore
the prices are great compared to most and they did a great job and take pride in their work
love love love you tammy
the seating was comfortable and lightingambiance was chill
i totally recommend this place
im not talking about a couple marks here and there i had severe burns that took about 8 months for the scarring to finally go away
the shop is amazingly decorated and designed
bye bye split ends and hello fun trendy look for this mommy of 3 go see red if u need a haircut
i highly recommend the bespoke salon to everyone that i meet
you know when the sealant between the tiles are somewhere black
well it didnt go away
its been almost 7 years and ive been to 6 different hairdressers
found my new nail salon
my teenage daughter is now a customer for 2 years and loves this place
my manipedis look natural and my nails have grown long and healthy
after just one treatment i have seen significant reduction
as they were speaking in their language the owner continued to point at me i was very caught off guard
i  highly recommend
ive always drove past hair envy on my way home from pretty much anywhere its literally a 2 min drive from my house
this was my first facial experience
anyway back to the girl that did my nails idk her name but ill go to her again next time
not customer friendly at all
what was strange was that she cancelled without any attempt to book a future date with him
i wish i could go there regularly but i actually live in southern california i found the salon by looking on yelp  the people are super friendly the place is very clean and their prices are comparable to what im used to paying
thank you so much
the lashes she used on me were crescent ones and it definitely gave me oomph for the holidays
my hair has already grown back and its just been a week and a dayso if i were to really try to keep myself looking clean youre talking 120 a month just for haircuts
she seems nice
the owners themselves are also super nice and theyre always around to greet you when you walk in
definitely will be coming back
i had to momentarily stop and make sure i was at the right place
they estimated the time to finish my car exactly
and the owners do a great job maintaining this spa so its very clean
spa lunch lunch is served in the tea lounge
this place really is awesome
the facial was good no steam however but overall left my skin very nice soft and even toned
the staff greeted me right as i entered showed me my locker and changing area and everything got started quickly
i drive 30 minutes just to get a cut here
elizabeth completely delivered
not to mention crazy talentedmy hair thanks her
it pretty cool if you want a massage once a month
now i have to go some where else and fix them
this is also the first nail salon ive been to that gives you a massage during your manicure
continue with the high pressure sales routine and i finally said im good im not spending 500 on face products thanks high pressure sales have the opposite result with me  no matter what you are selling or how amazing it is im not going to buy it
the ambiance is mediocre but your eyes are closed the entire time anyway
i can write so many good things about dulcinea but the things that i love about her is her peronsality she used to work at disney so she has the disney personality
i was able to even out everything myself later at home but felt embarrassed to even walk out in public
i had my haircut by amber today and it turned out great
my first visit to blo was pretty freaking awesome
the facial is 1hr30 minutes for 65 but you will not be disappointed
i have been going to this kohls for years
well stocked and the service is decent
esthetique is the only place for me and ill follow deb wherever she goes
front desk staff is awesome now
also its easier to find parking nearby
we quickly had to check out and go
then he did an aggressive buffing with a pumice bar until he burned my heels to the point that i can barely walk today
also my facial was wonderful and i was so relaxed i fell asleep
as a local i play here a lot maybe not a my players card but usually play here a few times a week i will save my time money to drive further and spend it w people who treat one like a human
you walk in and the lobby is beautiful but once you meet the front staff you know the service just isnt there
the guy i spoke to on the phone remembered my name when i walked in
her cut with soft layers allowed me to keep most of my length even though my ends were damaged
not only did my pedi suck and look ugly
the staff and stylists are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed
ive gotten my eyebrows done twice before seeing josalyn but wasnt satisfied with the results
go check it out for yourself youll love it
if was 15 minutes before the first one of us started getting her pedicure
its about a 20ish cab ride from the strip but well worth it
ive only been going for a short time but she has my hair color completely nailed from day 1 and her cuts and scalp massages are fantastic
it wasnt worth the 40
adequate and could be best in the area but definetely not in new york league
all in all i love these ladies and will continue to keep coming here to get my nails done
maria did an amazing job
so i stayed paying full price for the suite no kind of upgrade discount comp nothing
i but my tongue thinking to myself ive been ready for a haircut for the past hour ever since i walked in instead i replied im sorry i have to go
i used to only get my hair cut in new york and now i plan my haircuts around when i can go in to see chuck
the guy i got was terrible
the manager tried to give me some lame excuse about oh well they werent sure the oil could touch your skin
i love love love bomb hair
ive been to jessica twice now and i love going to her
so of course i went from the usual morning  afternoon  night saline routine to four sea salt soaks a day
i did an add on callus treatment  and my technician really made sure to leave  my feet as smooth  as possible
not so nice neighborhood so i guess that reflects the attitude if the business
customer service 810 pet stay deluxe suite 910 decorations around the hotel very modern and artsy
the dressing area had lotion shower caps and a few other goodies in addition to hair dryers and hot tools for use
sara is a triple threat
ive been thinking of getting my nose pierced for a long time now and my friend recommended me halo since she had hers pierced a month back
fyi they take cards but like many places only want the tip in cash
i was offered water listened to some great music that either made me want to workout or dance and just enjoyed the experience
i have had a membership here for almost 2 years
i moved from miami and i was initially worried i wouldnt find an elite barber
i was so excited to relax
i took the brush back to the store w the receipt
as i demanded to have the charges reversed to my credit card i literally burst into tears
we all went and had a great time
they have affordable brands like the sephora brand and bite beauty to more luxurious brands like christian louboutin and la mer
i told the lady that i wanted a 2 on the sides of my sons head and it was more of a 4 i was watching my 4 year old who didnt get her hair dried even though its part of the over priced package so i didnt notice until we got home
kativa is super sweet and did a great job
the staff was all very friendly and they had a huge selection of colors
its basically a waiiting area and in the back are the facialmassage rooms and in front is the manipedi area
ashley was hospitable and quite capable of taking my wishwashy thoughts about what to do with my ratsnest full of hair and turn it into adam levine quality style
they did very good on my feet they take there time to perfect all imperfections on my feet they say me down rite away they finished me pretty quickly at the same time took there time and did an amazing job on my full set
this man cave is worthy of the hall of man cave
not sure she was even licensed to do that
thank you king nails
i came in with my mom to get our nails done for my bridal shower after leaving another nail place across the street because it was taking so long
this place is a salon that has all suites for the stylists and  nail technicians
extremely pleased with my cut and color toni listened to me describe my hair concerns and she magically fixed it all
every time i come in they are kind and gracious
carlos is great
i would never go back
the gal that did my tan didnt try to be personable
place is legit
in the middle they got very busy and had to swap out one of the masseuses the boss himself took over
my stylist kyle tuttle is great always does such an amazing job
all of the ladies who actually perform the services have been wonderful
so of course we swung by there before turning in one night to find no water
i was sick so she really helped release the tension and aches in my body
front desk lady was also friendly she was a bit serious but none the less very helpful
i realize i should have said something prior to leaving but i could tell the girls wanted to get home it was closing time
totally worth the price
after a little wait a large lady in a lab coat comes in and sits down
i will never be shopping at that chanel store again
i found ali though and i really love her work
it was so easy and convenient and she did an amazing job
my husband gave up the military barber at nellis after almost 19 years and made jimmys his permanent barber
it is the rest of the service thats lackluster
however red rock offers a great buffet a good variety of eateries a bowling alley and every gambling option imaginable  roulette black jack craps slots poker etc
but i showed her a picture of something thats not subtle
i drove from henderson to this location because they were willing to do my nails last minute
jane is a phenomenal aesthetician and i prefer to go to her over other day spas  and ive tried a number of them here in charlotte
her salon is intimate and comfortable
ive been 2 maybe 3 times and the last time was unreal the lady doing my nails was a bit off her rocker
theres some big name tattoo outfits in vegas and i passed 3 other shops on the way to precious slut based on the reviews they received on yelp which is why i thought it important to add my own
my poor feet were in bad shape and now they have been pampered and renewed
the moose and elk mounts give off a real masculine feel but one that is not too over the top to where you feel like youre in a taxidermists shop
mary usually does my nails full set with gel polish on to and she is really sweet
and the staff is friendly
they have great wigs and customer service to boot
i have been a few times and had an ok experience but it has just gotten horrible
she asked for a trim of no more than 2 inches and ended up having 55 inches taken off
im always nervous about visiting new barbers but these guys are awesome
they are closed sundays fyi
keep in mind las vegas beauty items should not be bought on sale and like wise goes for the treatment of your hair spend the money if you have and if you dont supper cuts will do just fine but do not try to rashionalize that this place is just too pricey
trying to be considerate of the time i said no youre closing soon i can come back tomorrow
alors il commence par me couper longle du pouce de manire trs trs courte
not bland like other buffets rio venetian caesar
i waited so that my toenail would dry and the nail lady probably told the hostess of what happened who then proceeded to give me a pile around 15 of dermalogica samples
i love diva nails they are so friendly and attentive to their costimers are actually care about what your nails look like when they are finished
we werent planning on getting a tattoo but he just added to my hand on his chest  awesome work
im very satisfied with the large rooms nice patios good menu and lovely spa products iclandic moon flower
i like this place and come here often
i sent them to my wedding day stylist
anyone who wants to have a nice shiny straight  healthy hair miss timea can help you
i love going to this location because of all the cute shops and there is a starbucks right next door
after my service i was wanting to use the rest of the amenities at the spa which was included  before using the pool i wanted another mimosa i went to the front desk to order one
receptionist is extremely rude
she was super sweet and did a great job
plenty of classes equipment is up to date clean and well laid out
i figured since i want a minimum of 1 massage per month and this place is close massage was good staff was friendly that i may as well purchase it versus trying more places
she also did a good job on my hair also
she then told me she was waiting for the pharmacist to call her back
i got no apology from chang
christine is fantastic
the atmosphere is restful and the services are exceptional
like i said the paraffin was enjoyable and i opted for some minions nail art which wasnt sealed with a top coat and thus ruined less than 18 hours later at the water park
has a light touch but also had some good technique for tense areas
there was blonde hair everywhere on the floor on the chair etc
to top all of that off she was on her cell phone while doing my nails
i really like this place
the 45 qua day pass is probably one of the best vegas deals i have ever found
today i requested a basic wash and the attendant tried to get me to upgrade  3 different times
desert escape tanning exceeded all my expectations in the quality of products services and friendliness
she customizes your visit to what your skin needs and is dedicated to making it healthy and fresh again
this is old school italian mafia style shaving
absolutely loved the end result  highly recommend this salon
it is definitely a lot of money to consider spending on something that wont last forever
huge tv in the room plus another very nice tv in the bathroom
dishonest rude incompetent never again
especially how my appointment was treated to begin with
i could hear every sound in the salon during my massage
i purchased the scalp detox therapy shampoo and plan to go back and get the conditioner and tonic
definitely going to tag yall in my instagram pictures
lady was very nice
dennoch verzeihe ich hier auch kleinere fehler erwarte gewiss nichts berdurchschnittliches schliesslich fngt jeder mal an
always great service
i have a lot of hair and even though it takes a while to get it done deborah always makes you feel at home and the natural sunlight the pours in through the domed skylight makes you feel more liberated instead of feeling held captive at the salon
not only that they did an incredible job in giving me lashes despite what i didnt have to work with
she was fast efficient thorough and gentle
was pleasantly surprised
after about 5 minutes i was shown to a chair and an older woman unfortunately did not get her name  probably because she didnt offer started my pedi
it was the first time my niece got her eyebrows waxed
bobbi was absolutely great
unprofessional and not enjoyable
one of the worst haircuts i have ever had
this was when the treatment started to go downhill for me the mud was applied cold and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm
he then broke out the vibrating massagers and they smelled like poo
ive gone here to get my eyebrows done
her back has been bothering her for weeks and she said she feels like the pain was just pushed right out of her back
i felt very customised and cared for
she is honest and tells me if a style is not going to work and tells me what i need to do to have my hair look like the picture
this is my favorite nail salon
great atmosphere with amazing service
do you really want to wait an additional 3045 minutes for a stylist
walgreens this is inexcusable
keep in mind i got acrylic with shellac on top  rarely ever chips i would have paid for the fix too but she said no and grabs my hand
i always feel very relaxed afterwards
i will never come here again and if you do get ready for rude service and a long wait
ive been coming to vegas for years for boxing
why qua gets 5 stars  the roman baths are fantastic
jenny did a great job on my lashes
my nails looked like a 5 year old had attempted to shape them all uneven and horrible looking i didnt even want her to try to fix it for fear that i wouldnt have any nails leftthe nail polish was not even and had a lot of bubbles in them when done
to take full advantage of this alignment of events i strongly recommend that you go on the first or second day of the sale especially if that is a friday
they were super professional and the location is clean and inviting
ive gone here at least 6 times with family or friends had it only been up to me id go elsewhere
travelled from dallas to phoenix for a conference and needed a haircut in a bad way
this salon is definitely a 5 star
i have not once left feeling good about the service i was provided and im there quite a bit
not only does the western theme and western movies playing make for an awesome atmosphere  but the people and service are fantastic
we stayed in the deluxe suite high floor along with balcony and strip view a little pricy but its a vacation no regretshaha called for more coffee from housekeeping and they came within 15 mins room service was quick as well
samantha is a very talented hair dresser and a fun hang
eli knows what hes doing
she has incredible patience i had an acrylic set that needed to come off badly and she wanted to be careful not to break my real nails so she soaked them until they all came off
they looked so natural and perfect
and there are some stylists who do an amazing dry cut but my past experiences have shown me that not washing hair ends up in uneven ends and an overall choppy look
there was no wait and the guy really knew what he was doing
natalya did a very good job
i decided to seek out a new stylist in town after getting bored with the same ol thing
thank you so much posare for this amazing stylist
she even gave me a hand massage which never happens
when i asked for a manager and told them about the claim when we made the resie not only did he not apologize but he basically brushed me off
i would highly recommend this shop to anyone that loves a fun environment and great nails techs
as much as im happy with my purchase i am also very grateful for the wonderful customer service that michelle provided
the whole experience was horrible
its pretty expensive for me at 125 a peel at the regular price but she has offered other package options which were a bit more affordable
as an example of great customer service my gel polish chipped the day after i had it done and i called to make an appointment for that evening to get it fixed
we got there at 930 we didnt have to wait
i will not return
i will definitely be going back
heather is also awesome and always makes me feel welcome and comfortable
i should have listed to lisa cs review and not go here
she is professional and kind and always has a smile
after you change you head to a waiting area
for being one person her availability is very flexible
he is humble and talented a rare combination
she was super nice and friendly and 9 days later my manicure still looks great
thank you jameson
she made it sound like several services were included but ended up charging me 10 for callus remover and scrub
in addition she is extremely personable and will immediately put you at easeplus  prices are right
i responded to that text and let them know my preference and never heard back
if i do not hear back from her i will file a complaint with the labor board
i couldnt have been more wrong
plenty of parking including one hour parking right in front of the store
maybe nic is better at other types of art but not for what i needed
two nails were put on crooked and the left hand didnt match the right setthe manager has stated when the nails dont last its cause of the technician i overheard him say that to myself and 2 other clients well mine did not last nor am i satisfied customer
she was very fast and my brows never looked better
in there once a week
even though the positions where very awkward she made me feel comfortable and that is something not everyone can do im  sure
i loved them
i thought to myself is 7 dollars worth it to let this lady hack my hair some more
very grateful i drove further in
i live in southern california and am used to having my makeup done by hollywood makeup artists
i dont remember who did them but i walked in just before closing so i dont blame them for rushing
looking forward to return
i get asked constantly who does my eyebrows julies been doing mine since i was fifteen
i went back for a redo and was in a time crunch which i told then i was
i went to regis because i wanted to make sure i got a really good haircut
she works so so hard and takes great care of the salon and the customers
walked away and then finally decided to get a massage
i need to get my vitamin d somehow or i will be miserable
she offered the hand of another stylist  who was free did not catch her name fair skinned younger hispanic girl
i play tennis a lot it was very helpful to me
will definitely be going back
all in all ive had good experiences every time
and in case my opinion isnt enough for you they were just named one of the top 100 salons by elle magazine
cleanliness is such a big thing for me because i have tanned at most the tanning salon in the valley it hard to find a good one
they basically dont know how to cut hair and they are not that honest comparing to maya
plus the experience was pleasant because she was so sweet and friendly
we would receive quotes of prices of 350400 for a tattoo of 3 roses that would be on her thigh
get you in and out as quick as possible
the space was clean parking was easy right next to the harris teeter at providence commons  corner of providence and ballantyne commons pkwy and all of the young women who were working this evening everyone else there getting their hair cut was male seemed pleasant and competent as far as i could tell
the worst manicure i have ever received in my life
there are beautiful beds set up everywhere and an all around great ambience
it usually goes badly
i checked in online and the stylist rachel was available for me within 5 minutes of my arrival
i went in and listened to my comedy channel on pandora while she worked her magic she was done in about an hour or so and she was very professional
i definitely recommend
its all full circle
i have been going to studio g for the past two years
they are a bit pricey from what i hear some others charge but i dont want to risk trying somewhere else and not get the same results
so i used to come in all the time to get gel manicures but in the past couple of times ive been in my manicure doesnt even last 3 days also she didnt put top coat on the entire nails she missed a ton of spots and left some coot on my cuticles
i just recently discovered pretty nails
i found them when i was looking for a new place to tan since the old place i went wouldnt let me bring my son
they should not tell you how much minimum you have to tip unless you go to the restaurant and have party of 6 or more anyway  i wont come back here and dont recommend anybody to come here based on my bad experience
i felt like i wasin a little oasis
on 1 of the other nails which is mine she tried prying it off
and when it was time for the bill it did not induce a heart attack
she swore she saw highlights but there were none
always listens to what you want and does great work
nonetheless i made an appointment and gave the manager my name and groupon certificate number to hold my appointment
the steve guy gave me the worst haircut of my lifehe cut the front of my hair way too short and uneven
love this place
nope its no longer my favorite nail salon
if i could give this place zero stars i would
definitely go see danielle
they are experts at eyebrow waxing and offer many other services
had the most amazing massage today by laura
zero complaints here leaving her shopshe has rescheduled my appt and accommodated me with my busy schedule
well never return
preferably during the warmer months so i can hit that pool
i went in to get my highlights updated and my over all color
i go to her for everything
we collaborated throughout the process to make changes whenever necessary
this location is a little out of my way but well worth the drive each month
things went downhill after that
not a word
but she made me feel so comfortable and relaxed
it finally healed a week later
earned them an extra star
i had never heard of sugaring prior to arriving at this sugar spa and i am so glad i decided to give this a try
but front desk girl gets 1 star from me
when our appointment came time we came back in and starting speaking with emmanuel the actual barber who was extremely pleasant
considering its my second time at urban skin solutions and i like the products i will visit a third time
i was greeted and taken care of right away
alyssa is my  service provider every time i go here
well rest assured you need not worry about any disappointments with alan
every one likes to feel special and they like to feel good about how they look
91514 update the office manager called me and apologized for my experience
the store is bright and clean
needed to have my gel nails redone and found this place online
i really did feel like each curl and i have like 1000 on my head did get individual attention
my son walked into this barber shop no one bothered to greet or acknowledge him
this place has great ventilation good location and is the most customer centric nail salon ive ever been to
now if youre looking for a spa like feel or a relaxing environment this is not the place
the haircut was very nice and then we moved on to the facial and the shave
it would have been nice to have known up front that the music was no longer happening
ive never had my eyebrows walloped thin here and it doesnt hurt as much either
the worse experience there was last time where a young girl hacked my hair and i walked out of the salon with the back of my hair sticking up like a peacock not an intentional style either
i felt at ease straight away
man wollte mich zurckrufen und einen termin geben ich warte heute noch auf den anruf
but you also have to tip them so youre looking at 3035 for a mens haircut
she didnt explain to me why she didnt remove the randoms
i have been twice to see izzy
i really thought maybe i was going crazy or in the wrong place
i will definitely be recommending this studio to my friends
but i have done this before and never had this type of reaction
my friend who accompanied me at the consultation also got it done and hers looks great as well
prices are so so reasonable 25 for cut and style plus tip and no one will ever know you didnt spend a ridiculous amount at an overpriced uptown salon
my only quibble is that the treatment room is right off the main storewaiting area and you can hear people talking during the treatment
he finished my sak yant in 3 hours
she does highlights lowlights cuts and covers the gray for me
so im not a shopper
he gave me a fantastic haircut at a fair price
liza chanel was so sweet and thorough
she does an amazing job and is always so kind
she came out and asked me if she could fix it
we went to the coffee shop and nobody waited on us so we took our business away from the property
they provide the lotion for your hands and feet as well as a shower cap to cover your hair
you will love her relaxing calm atmosphere
they also have a good selection of quick lunch items snacks and drinks
pulled out the drill
my podiatrist never mentioned reflexology as part of recovery
funny i had a photo of this place pinned to my wall on pinterest for a while and didnt even know when i made the reservation that this is where i was going
ive been bouncing around from stylist to stylist since moving to charlotte
they are all so sweet minus one employee but hey we all have to have one right no idea what her name is and did i mention the pink everywhere
one of the reviews noted that a pro was that they know when to use hard vs soft wax
smoking is prohibited which is a plus in my book
nicole has been doing my nails for years
its also a bit awkward to check if this is an issue before you leave because the estheticians stay in the room with you as you undress and then dress afterwards  probably to save time  but it does feel a little awkward
the other super awesome thing was that they had a special pillow with a cutout for your belly that allows you to lay on your stomach
she fixed my lashes after they had been destroyed by a different girl that didnt know what she was doing with lashes
i have mixed feelings about the green valley ranch
all in all these guys make the whole process an enjoyable experience
ive been coming here for the past 9 months and i only see cindy which i learn today she is no longer there
she was very nice and pleasant to talk with during the appointment
i called the internet support folks and they had me run speedtestnet to get a measurement
every time i have been to this salon nicole has done my hair and let me tell you its been amazing
he proceeds to applying the full set he is filing my nails so hard that he makes them bleed and does nothing about it
for the price and the uptown location i am very pleased with the quality of my nails on both hands and feet
my friends and i travel often and live a luxurious lifestyle
the place is small but its why i gave it 5 stars
just a touchup but ill be back for more
i undress lie face down in the hard table and out my face into the vision which is outlined with a hard towel
i just went back for fills 2 days ago
i was completely happy with his work i recommend you try this shop out if youve never been
its been so hard to find a good nail salon and i will definitely be making this one my regular
you can take care of all your needs grocery shopping nice restaurants etc
i made an appointment an hour in advance and they were ready to start as soon as i got there despite the fact that it was starting to get busy
worst case i wait a few minutes
the fee wow the fees
she waxed my upper lip and i got a horrible infection that lasted weeksi ended up going to 2 dermatologistsa 2nd one after it didnt go away for a month
she was so sweet and reassuring ill definitely go back for my second cartilage
i loved my nails after having them done and thought they were so cute
i was also told it would be a light massage because the hormones in my body already relax my muscles and it was policy and couldnt be changed which is not the case in other locations and should be told beforehand
daritza my nail tech deserves 5 stars however as a whole i cannot give more than 3 stars
i was not offered an apology or anything of the like
otherwise youll be calling constantly and have to tip each time
nice people nice haircut cool relaxing experience
she told me that restylane gives the lips a more natural look
he made me feel as though he would operate on me with the care and precision he would a family member
she did such an amazing job
i do have to say that after giving them a go for myself im definitely hooked
their option for green products is amazing
the selection of nail polish on the wall racks to choose from was really sketchy no opi brand
i was there for the week for a training with a team of people and i brought the information back to the hotel to share
my husband said it was ok to have someone else cut his hair and shave his beard
if someone wants a mushy bed and back pain then they can call you to have it removed
so they had me choose another color
i was very disappointed in massage envy and would not recommend anyone getting a facial there
none of the chattering you normally have at a nail salon which was a delight
wont be going back
and housekeeping missed our room
finally ive found jennifer
i never wear makeup or do much with my hair
as i sat in the waiting area i admire every single detail that the encore put into making this place comfortable and just beautiful to look at
go to breathe it is a amazing
they were very busy but we were treated very nice and the guys setting up the pedicure spots were very accommodating
ive been going to privee since it opened and always enjoyed it
but a good massage for 40 i thought my 40 was well spent
i showed her a pic of how i exactly wanted it  i walked out 100 happy
best place in town for a foot bath message and a thai yoga massage
over all our stay at scottsdale camelback resort was a great vacation
laura gives a fantastic massage
at the very end of the call i was then told by the receptionist that this was for their park west location
she made my first experience very comfortable
i came in for a ear piercing with my 2 friends
my mom bought us a package deal for a massage sparking apple cider lunch manicure and pedicure
i highly recommend kearns  co hair  oh
clean friendly efficient place
we would not leave food no matter what but this was justehh also as a bbq sauce fan the three sauces were not even that great
the pedi was better than the average deluxe pedicure i have had at other places
i also like that they pose a different question to their stylists each monthweek on the walls and they post their answers next to pictures of themselves
my hubby took me here for my birthday
she also did a great job recommending products without being too pushy
he is very professional and pays close attention to detail and your needs
ulta browbar from now on
i got a simple tattoo on my ankle almost 5 years ago
nick my barber takes his time he is a perfectionist and professional barber
just politely ask them to not park there
i drove about 45 miles to this shop and it was completely worth it
actually gave me a great neck massage which most therapists shockingly dont do
im so glad i found this salon
got a pedicure which was very reasonably priced 25 and decently done
definitely will be back
if youre in need of a cut this is the only place to go in the charlotte area
overall it was below average experience
the salon is beautiful and nice location with friendly staff
was so happy to find this place as i got off my flight
will be coming back as a regular
make sure you let her know how lightdeep the pressure is in your comfort zone
ok so it all started out with the fact that i get nervous about big events since im so hair and makeup challenged
who measures hair before and after their cut
she is always so sweet and nice and does the most amazing pedicures and manicures
ive gotten tons of compliments and will def
sometimes it takes like 30 bad experiences to find one good one
jillian is a true master at her craft
especially comments like um you really need to be trying to schedule this stuff further in advance
my nails look phenomenal
oh mind you she told me its gonna take a week till my money is fully refunded
charles is amazing and im so happy i came across him
its always hard for me to get my hair as blonde as i like because i naturally have straight dark asian hair
1  he did say hi how  are u guys
ive been getting shellac manicures here for about 6 months and have only had one less than stellar service
and personally im not a fan of too much chit chat
first things first the overall look of the place is nothing ive ever seen before
i love everything about this place
trust me  ive tried several places and bombshell lashes is the best
chose arizona advanced dermatology because other dermatologists around me had very long waiting lists for appointments and i wanted help soon for my itchy skin which turned out to be hives
they didnt have a lot of reviews but the ones they did have were all really great
the prices were consistent with every other nail salon in arizona p but al did a great job on my nails
this time my appt was only a little over an hour since my blow drying time was much faster
the owners do as well
most of my interactions with staff were very short and they were very rude
thanks for taking the time to make my eyebrows beautiful
spa bliss is a 1woman show and trust me thats a good thing
now imagine someone talking to you the entire sessionit was the opposite of relaxing
lunch is the better priced deal
i am so impressed at how much she did for me
after my session was over i met with andrew as i walked out the door
i have been going to april for a few years now and will continue doing so until my hair falls off  lets hope it doesnt but if thats the case im sure she will do an amazing job with extensions
i will take my business else where and advise all of my professional colleagues and friends of my horrific experience
i did get the free gift though so that was nice
the new location is wonderful
i found polish heaven
their products work so well and in and out in an hour
she took off 45 inches of my hair not 12 inches like she said she would
when i walked in i was greeted by a spunky gal named jessi
i highly recommended
their piercer angie is very professional clean down to earth
i arrive often minutes before class which is why i need yoga to kind downtoearth owners and instructors greeting students at the door
my first experience here wasnt the greatest though
when we get there they ask us if we mind coming back in 30 minutes
steamroom wasnt working  2
i was very indecisive
book your cut with matsumi and you wont be disappointed
i stopped there the first time with my friend because we thought the girl working there was pretty and my recently single friend was in full hunting mode taking that poor sale lady as a prey for sketchy tactics
what usually happens is ill go hmm i need insert good here then ill mosey up to this giant store and walk out with a giant bag full of makeupfoodtoiletriesrandom product and that i didnt know i needed until i saw it
went here for my first time today and i was very impressed
groupon apologized and immediately refunded me for the laser hair removal package
the stay was three nights
acrylic  gelshellac nail art airbrushing
she has art and flowers instead of a plastic uterus
kusmi teas and belmonte raw juices
i have been struggling for 10 years with acne
cathee has been doing my hair for 5 years now
and theres much more
here its 20 for an half hour of foot massage only 28 for a 45 min massage and 38 i think for an hour massage
she is very knowledgable and makes you feel right at home
couldnt wright a review sooner because after my appointment i left the country
my first time here for a pedi and loved it
they gave us amazing customer service and wonderful haircuts amy also talked me into waxing my nose and boy was she right when she said it doesnt hurti will never trim my nose hairs again i am officially hooked on waxing lol
francesca was absolutely amazing
i never ask to choose a certain person because i am happy with whoever does my eyebrows
we ended up spending 3 hours here but would have stayed even longer if the wet saunas were usable
at no time did i ever feel to exposed or uncomfortable
no one carries everything i need the way lotions  potions does
i recommend them to all of my friends and family
i can only assume it was racially motivated
craig was busy when i was free so they got me an appointment with lloyd
gets it right every time
great conversation attention to detail and wonderful massage
am i waxing poetic
i would like to try getting my nails done there to see how they are
food was good but small amount of selection  not sure if it is worth 35 pp
they argued no since they had trimmed her cuticles so im paying 25 for a cuticle trim and paint
obviously they have zero respect for those who make appt
yumi is the nail gem of vegas i am a nail fanatic and my search had ended
my room was dated and showed some wear
they offered everyone waiting a bottled water since it was so hot out
the only issue i have is the price of hair cut was a bit high
the shop is kind of tucked back away but i think everyone in the neighborhood knows where its at
i was out the door at 1201pm and ready to show the world my freshly cleaned up brows
obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which i had to have someone else fix because you botched mine
i explained to her that i am a mac customer but i wanted to see if they had something similar that i could get
one of the best i know
now for the services i got the works facial the first time around which is lovely steam on your face a cleansing extractions dermaplaning microdermabrasion and a chemical peel
after she was done i looked in the mirror and my eye brows were great haha
why advertise on a flyer and website that you are opened 7 days a week when you really arent
my sisters came off in strips after not quite 2 weeks she went back and paid half price to get it changed and this time stripped off even worse
even though my neck is a lot better im sure ill be back  thats how good the massage was
so i wait to be seen and skip the cash for nowand when i get in the seat i tell him precisely what i want done which was 3 things 15 on the side scissor trim the top and square the neck at a certain spot that i showed him to which he says ok
just because someone is not dressed to the nines is no reason to treat them like crap
rooms are perfectly smoke free smelling though
the shop was slow with only three clients
however a very aggressive clinic in to take your moneythey have their osteopath naturopath acupuncturist all giving massages so that they can bill your insurance for dollarsthis way they are not limited to massage therapist to bring in dollars
we just pretended it did so we had an excuse to walk over to red hot robot and begin what i predict will become a crippling obsession with vinyl toys
my pedicure she kept putting my feet in weird positions i have problems with my feet since my car accident and my regular  place and every other place has never had an issue doing my pedicure
nicest haircut ive had in years and i like my guy back home
it looks fun professional and beautiful along with being so shiny and healthy
i wasnt sure where to go and was clearly needing some directionthey all started talking in their native language until finally one of them approached me and  gave me a direction to go in
this was the first haircut ive had in pittsburgh and ill definitely come back to mint to schedule another cut with kelsey my next goaround
these guys are awesome  cut great hair  go straight razor for precision cuts  line ups
if i had a choice id stay here every time i was in vegas
its a spacious facility filled with every kind of exercise equipment you could want
im very happy w my givenchy and i am very happy w the fact that the sales lady showed me other vegan options as well
then at the 1 week mark an entire nail was bare
volila was able to get me in right away and she completely transformed my hair
ill be going back
i have a thick beard and very sensitive skin which he picked up on almost immediately and did what he could to soothe my skin and eliminate razor burn
and just as important is trish cosmetic coordinator who has made me feel like part of the family
my appointment was yesterday and ive already received a number of compliments
hard to imagine trying any other place now
i had such a great time and she was super informative about all the products how to use them what they were good for etc
i gave them some pointers in that first visit so i was hoping the 2nd visit would be much better
i had a basic pedicure for 26
the massage itself was very different from a typical massage you would get at a spa or somewhere elsea lot more involved if i must sayi was feeling a lot of pain during the massage
however its not like theres a limit on how often you can go or what you can use and they have so much to offer  that its not unreasonable
do not go here
we asked for quiet and thats what we got
i was so disappointed that the next day i went somewhere else after paying 23 for a polish that i couldve done myself
they give you a black soft fleece blanket because it does get cold after youve been laying down for 2 hours
customer service sucks at this store too
although i appreciate a good manipedi every once in awhile i mostly follow deals
they also put 2 small cotton pads on my eyes while the mask was drying this is what they call the eye mask
every one a beacon of customer care and technical skills
weekends are very busy
they want you to leave satisfied
about half way through the session i was able to get up and close the lid to have complete darkness
she takes her time and does a great job they hold up great
my husband loved it and i feel awesome
ill preface with this saying i had very high hopes for my experience here
i was pleasantly greeted by the receptionist i think shes the owner forgot to ask her name
just by the look on the womans face you could tell that she completely forgot about us
shes very good
wednesday with biggs and everything turned out amazing
i think the brazilian keratin treatment was new to the salon at the time and she was one of the few stylists trained to use it
he is awesome  and i recommend this place
unless if you bought it using a deal voucher it is a rip off
ive been a patient for years
however the next time i went to trim it and still had to pay the same which was heartbreaking
the woman at the front desk kept motioning at the woman to smile but she continued the whole appointment with a frown
theyre both fantastic
what i got what less that what most basic nail places do no scrubbing exfoliation or even light massage
i really like the work that they do for the price
there were two girls working
alex was very knowledgeable of the services and she even suggested the body scrub which was one of the best body scrubs i ever had
this walgreens is in such a great location
but after a few minutes with her i was convinced she was special
send me a message if you need his number
it looks amazing and since shes doing it slowly it gets rid of the shock factor and keeps my hair healthy
it sounds silly but there is the cutest little dog that stays around the shop because its one of the workers and it made the experience so great lol
this never happens here
if your front desk told us early we will call you guys early to tell our situation to be late to make sure someone can serve us when we arrived there
just tried to wipe it away
when i went to visit family in ca or i went to vegas for the weekend i would just make an appointment with the local salon and they always had walkin appointments available
each of us got a smock  neck cover for him
just had a fill after a month of getting a full set and only lost a few but that was because my own lashes grew out
the full kitchen and all the amenities are on point
i bought a coupon deal for a manicure and pedicure here
bbst is so convenient
when i decided to surprise my mom with a spa day for her 50th birthday i worked with johnyee and the girls at the salon who were very accommodating and worked around the others schedule so my mom could go from one station to another seamlessly
i worked with incredible men who were inspired and passionate about what they do ben bethel andre bonhote and william reed
i checked yelp review before i go and this place was one of the place that has best review
the two star rating is specific to the hotel itself
she absolutely knows what she is doing
look at this
even the location is very far from downtown toronto but the decor and 2 tv setting are still very charming
i love this place
the absolute best massage of my life
the only reason why im giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because there seemed to be some issues when paying and getting names mixed up
this review is purely rating the spa facility
i am so glad i decided to come here
2 location location location  its placed in an ideal spot on the strip
this salon is lucky to have her
she made it quick and easy
so i called to see if they would redo the nails that were chipped and i was told to come in which i did
minus one star because the service was a bit cold and i got the feeling that the nail technicians were talking in their native language about some of the customers
what really sets her apart from most estheticians is her attention to detail
so he goes in the back room to mix the color  starts complaining about me
and the pedicure massage chairs are the same ones ive seen in most every strip mall nail place which i personally find uncomfortable
finding lindsey at whitney hair  wellness basically saved my hair and my sanity
the sales person loudly and aggressively asked him what he was using for his acne
to my great surprise and relief there was actually a very very good promo going on mix and match 3 products for 21
that includes a back massage
so soothing and they know their business
i would have paid extra if she wanted it or whatever
this last visit was the worst as his hair was butchered beyond immediate correction
they are knowledgable of all the new trends and do not limit themselves to just nails as you can get a new set of lashes or have unwanted hairs waxed its all up to you
give it a try if you have never done it
omg i was shocked to see that
who knew such a really great place existed in that interesting beauty mall in scottsdale arizona i know i didnt
parking issues due to renovations has cleared up now thank goodness
if you need to get your nails done for a special occasion or just love a unique design this is the place to come
i would return if it was a special event but wouldnt make them my goto place as i cant afford that and even if i could wouldnt spend that
talk about great
only going there from now on for my pedicures
then when i flipped over he did the same weird touching technique to my neck and shoulders that he did to my back he literally just held his hand on the base of my neck for 5 minutes without doing anything
their products are amazing too
shell make your next hair experience incredible
i had no problem booking an appointment a couple days out they had lots of room
they also have a good music selection to listen to while you enjoy your nail experience
we visit this place about every 56 weeks so my son can get lined up with his cute little fohawk and my daughter just got her first real haircut at our last visit
i got the matte color and it looks amazing
is it your leave in conditioner
because of your giving  you touched many and made a huge difference  in the lives you touched
i was so impressed by the therapist that i signed up for the monthly massages to continue getting some healing from her
im so happy i came here for my very first ever lip fillers
ive been coming here since 2012 but more recently for a new procedure laser hair removal for my underarms
a loyal customer shouldnt have to jump through hoops and ladders for a 20 refund that was mischarged in the first place
she even gives you great tips and tricks on how to style your hair by far the best round brusher this side of vegas
third place is a charm i guess i finally found my goto nail spot in the hendersonvegas area
getting my hair done blonde is a huge change for me and i was so worried about it but i dont have to worry anymore
she then brought over a nail tech to look at my nails and she began to tell me that she would only clean up the cuticle and add another layer of polish
and they have a rewards program
she offered some old beatup face wash sample in its place
he took one look at my hair and said shes crazy
i have too great of a life to get upset over small things like waiting yes i was annoyed but not upset i have been working on myself
good luck with that
not for makeup
a lot of history has taken place here
i was worried they would give me a weird brow shape so it did stopped me for making appointment for awhile until one day i decided to give it a try
very nice guys and they were very open to helping me pick out flavors or additives based on what i was trying to accomplish healthwise i appreciate it guys
if you are looking for a new salon try this place out you wont regret it
i stopped in the salon to make the appointment and yvonne came out to the front desk to talk with me and find out exactly what i wanted to do
dont let his size fool you he is a tank of love however if you dont rewind your attitude  he will not hesitate to fast forward an ass whoopin
the salon is classy clean and so well put together
the enivorment is pretty and the water is actually hot which i enjoyed
this is a true five star shop
the math didnt make sense and the only explanation i received was it was a nc tan tax
michelle has been doing my hair since she opened her salon 20 years ago
throughout the entire styling my hair was yanked it hurt
well all these asian nail shops need to learn how to treat all people equal and important because if it wasnt for us americans red yellow black and white these business owners would not have a business and would need and want to go back to their own country and mistreat their own people
the staff will get to know you by name and personally help you
i get a ton of compliments and the only hairs i have to now shave are blonde which given all current technology at least to my knowledge will never reduce those
i was given a cute little bottle of ice cold water and had a great younger tech who gave me a great pedi
i have never had to wait more than 5 min and usually less time than that
i felt the oh sorry voicemail was inadequate
we noticed a little mold around the pools
if i ever get another tattoo it will be from josh
she knew exactly what she was doing which kept me at ease since i have extremely thick hair that some stylists just get lost in
i paid barely over 60 for all these services
and he really did
i know i wont ever attempt to go there again
i cant believe those racist men still work for walgreens and havent been fired yet
ask for kelly
very fun vibe great bars party pool fun decor
they have 3 different services sunbed red light collagen boost light and spray tan
the normal exercise area was relocated to a 5th floor meeting room because of a remodel of the spa area
i will never go to this establish again
kim did call me today to explain shed been out of town so heres the deal  there was not one person at this place who was considerate enough to spend the 10 seconds it would have taken to call and tell me that kim was not in
its plenty of places to dine out in the plaza as well
such a beautiful facility in the heart of centennial
she is always professional and polite
so i got a few good deals for my baby under 10 with a coupon as well
i felt relaxed there because i could see that he knew what he was doing and i wasnt going to leave with butchered hair
my nails were ragged and not smooth they werent shaped uniformly at all
an amazing experience service the service is what sealed the deal at this spa
i pressed further that this happened only yesterday that it was placed in their box and that means their people were the only ones in possession of it
sure enough here i am out of state and they are threatening to send me to a collection agency to get there money i am not going to stand back and take this though this time i am going to stand up for my rights
she does beautiful work i get nothing but compliments on my hair
not too long ago i began seeing sharon and she is absolutely phenomenal
fun and easy to talk to
i have no problems with the service per se but this really isnt going to be my goto place of lashes
her husband didnt announce it or say anything but this makes sense as to why a man kept answering her phone
im usually a big pastry fan so i was very disappointed in that section
do not go here
the massage was okay ive had better but ive also had worse
she is worth every dime you will spend
i bought a living social deal for laser hair removal because my friend recommended this place to me
best massage chair ever
we all got up to collect the items 3 seconds and when we turned around someone had taken our seats
for all who is wondering how much she charges
ripping off your first clients is not the right approach to starting a new business
check them out as you wont be disappointed
this room yeah awesome
i always spend so much money there but i wont be going there ever again
im all about technology and efficiency but they need to come up with a better system
to cut a long story short i went in just to browse around for a few minutes ended up being talked to for about 30 minutes by all 4 employees in the store who told me about their hopes and dreams so i decided to just buy a bath bomb so they would leave me alone one of the employees managed to stop me before i even got in the checkout line to try to sell me another product and then started talking about herself and her college life nice girl but i am really just looking to leave
had a really great experience here
the people are nice and the rooms are immaculate
everything very clean and extremely welcoming
ill definitely go back my next trip to scottsdale
the buffet features different salads fruits meats breads and desserts
in mn its verboten everywhere
the girl then says ummm the only thing i ask is that you dont touch the curls because it will lose its shape
i had a haircut and digital perm here by hiroki
white lotus is a bumble and bumble salon which is an excellent high end line
the place is best and cheaper on non holiday weekdays
i will be back
she then took a poll asking the other workers which antihumidity products they recommend
the staff was friendly and the salon was by far the best looking ive seen comparitive to our local burke williams spa in the bay area
korean family spa  382 magenetic drive 416 5141965 open 24 hours a day 7 days a week
thats pretty superb
she did an awesome job on my nails
also the tv was small
best facial in the city
every professional stylist i have ever met takes this into account
okay so then once i was seated with shawn he asked me how i would like my hair i told him to cut off no more than an inch because i have been growing out my hair for 5 years now and i hate it when i tell someone i want a light trim and they go crazy
ive been going to anns salon for about a year
massage envy blue diamond is definitely my favorite location
we should have known since there were zero cars there not to go in ugh
that said the spa itself is an extremely pleasant experience
the only difference between the two is that their other location closes at 1200 am and with my odd work hours longer hours suit me better
since she did so well i decided not to wait another whole month for her to fix my color
she showed me where i needed to let my hair grow in a little bit more to even them out after the butcher job i received at the place i went to before
worst hair cut since my mom cut my long hair in 2nd grade funny too because my moms name is charlotte
im not exactly modest so i dont really care what happened but clearly others did
she is a magician with color
kayla is a real professional kind and focused on her work
to our surprise harmony was in the same shopping strip and after calling they could fit both my husband and i in shortly
her hands were not fluid nor glide over my face but stiff dry and rough touch
i didnt know what to expect since i was buying it with a coupon doad
he paused and gave me a blank stare and said that he was told that no one had reserved a cabana for the day
i always call ahead to see if she can take me in and she always accommodates me
i had some serious back and neck issues going on
just got my lips done this is my 3rd time and 3rd person and im obsessed with them this time
i have called and made appointments every time i have gone and they still ask me my name 23 times before i even get anyone
another big reason i will not be back is that 3 of the 5 times i had been i was cut on my finger and had a scab for about a week
she showed me a colour book and told me i would have to bleach my hair which is what i expected
the ladies up to the task were wonderful and very friendly
i have been getting treatments for 4 months now
alison was great
this spa is as pricey as all of the other vegas spas but at least here the quality almost matches the exorbitant prices
i finally have nicely shaped brows
i will never go back or tell anyone to go there
this place actually ruined my whole day
i arrived at 10am when they opened on a thursday and she took me right away because there was nobody there and im busy and have no time really to be waiting
also received a very relaxing enjoyable basic pedicure done by tim he did a great job as well and took his time also had good conversation
took my high school aged niece here for a back to school mani pedi as a treat
love  my nails shes an awesome lady  very professionaloh and shes funny too you gonna love her really recommend her to all
thanks for everything
my gf goes here for botox and juvederm in her lips
i love them and will be going back every time from now on
he said if it had been a color job they would but not a cut
i was expecting the usual massage chair and jet foot bath
the staff is friendly  always make you feel comfortable in the shop
prior to my first tattoo i spent may hours researching for the best tattoo parlors in the region
when i was there i wasnt greeted by anyone for about 15 minutes
great experience all around
you wont be disappointed
i do not need any more sstuff
been to this location twice now and have received a ton of compliments on my new hair color
dude is the
not even a discount or a comp
i was worried i wouldnt even survive the flight to vegas let alone try to hang with a bunch of cousinsfriends all weekend
inside the salon is pretty typical but there is good music and in general great ambiance
that is not the case here
the hotel is connected to the bellagio by walkway basically think of it as another tower to the bellagio and is really close to the bellagio conference rooms and convention halls if youre there for business as well
and i see more and more negative reviews coming in talking about how bad this place is
the receptionist was really cute and friendly and i would definitely go back
i would give zero stars if i could
sorry for the inconvenience
i even have my sisters and best friend seeing nancy only
