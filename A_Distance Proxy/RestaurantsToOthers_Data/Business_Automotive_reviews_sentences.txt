talked with alex and in no time was sold on a deluxe pkg
i would do it again
they said i needed brake pads that were full ceramic and that the brake pads were causing my problems
buying used vehicles is taking someones word
jason is a great guy and he has a lot of experience with jeeps
i cant begin to describe to you the doe eyes i feigned when my boyfriend asked me if i knew anything about the scratch on his rims with the most pained look in his eyes tip  the person who refaced the rims and does minor cosmetic repairs is only available on mondays and only if it isnt raining because he works outdoors
i can tell you that i either come here or the one across unlv
we came here for this place several times and everytime it is fully committed
pete helped us out right away and was very responsive to our needs
he made sure that everything was how i wanted it to be
i will definitely be back to buy my new bike from ridenow solely based on the wonderful customer service i received today from matthew and the competitive prices on their products
car wash was decent  not the best a few spots were missed
went here for 2 tires walked to the mall
stay far far away
1 call me and let me know when you are coming
when i walked inside three other sales people were standing one by the cashier one in the parts section and the other by store offices
overall a great experience and great quality work for this price especially for the time he takes also dealing with the arizona heat
it was great and he offered some other solutions in securing other doors in my house
there are chips candy bars and protein bars
i called that place and they had no problem getting me in on a saturday when im free
i had the opportunity to drive a audi r8 mainly because im impatient and i noticed it wasnt getting any love and with the fleet of cars speedvegas has i can sympathize so i knew id get seattime faster
the owner kevin gave me a great price on an oil change and is highly rated by other yelpers
not only do they powdercoat but they media blasted them prior to the coat
went on a recommendation from others and we were not disappointed  it was a winner
next visit with tan carpets same result
the foam brushes are soft and filled with pink suds no skimping like other places
i have a security lock on the ignition and when i attempted to explain how to start the truck while handing over the keys i was left as he sped out of the door without a care for the words coming out of my mouth
he was even willing to drive all the way up to 101 and raintree to my office to pick me up so i could get my car
they told us that if the stainsmell was not completely removed and we could still smell it that theyd happily reshampoo the carpet again
what more can you ask for
amazing wine list casual place and a recent facelift for half of the restaurant
thanks  jr i always recommend homers to my friends
i was able to get out of work a little early and drove almost 45 minutes out to his shop and when i was about 5 minutes away he sent me a text message and told me he had double booked me and there would be no one there at the shop when i arrived
have used them for the past 4 years and will continue to recommend them for many years
only glitch was there was an error printed on my contract
for my first time being there im kind of in the middle the outside of my vehicle looks okay and nice the customer service is pretty good but they lack and attention to detail as soon as i got into my truck i noticed i still had soda on my center console and last time i checked i paid for the console to be cleaned
so the finance guy lied to me there
my recommendation is to stay away from this dealership
very nice people with very fast and good service
performed the work to be done as expected
i bring my car back again feb 22 and this time dave had taken the day off and so i spoke to the general manager
i could not have been any happier  major auto saved my vacation and my car
they also give you coffee and have a tv available for when you wait
also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded theres tables randomly scattered everywhere
so now i have to either pay for a new smog myself or go before work on monday to get the smog test redone at the dealership and hope it updates on time for me to do my registration online in monday
the one critique i have and why i rated findlay chevrolet 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars is the salespersons communication postsale was lacking which sadly is typical of salespeople
i highly recommend busy boots
as for the food some things i recommened for an appetizer are the prawns in a blanket spicy chilli chicken wings and also the tom kah kai soup
i only wanted a car wash  my brother in law told me about a terrible experience like this just today and it turned out to be the same place
great selection of batteries from watches and car remotes to home security systems and autos
whats the point of making an appointment if people that didnt make one get services first
i contacted jason service manager and he strongly recommended i bring the car in to check the integrity of the filter
you will notice i usually only go on to make good reviews but the automotive repair industry needs to be exposed until they stop trying to take advantage of people
we have been working with andy in service for 5 yearsand hes great
he answered my tons of questions was very patient with me and made me feel so comfortable with my decisions
will definitely recommend to friends or family
i just had a bad battery
that was about 2 years ago
customers were not alerted to this closure
great place very nice people working there they wont rip you off
not out of this world but darned good
even with remodeling going on i had a fantastic time at the peoria vw dealership
i appreciate their efforts to get me the best deal i can find
found my new local repair people
come here almost everyday and every time i come im always treated excellently
i am sorry that you felt this way about your experience
the place looked busy but i didnt have to be anywhere for an hour so i thought id take a chance
in this case my dog had been in the house for the past 8 or 9 hours i kept saying i will come back tomorrow but i need to get home and take care of my dog they were laser focused on sealing the deal and had no consideration for my own personal needs
the problems ive seen are the frequent equipment failures during the wash forcing customers to either wait until the equipment comes back online i have waited up to 15 min before leaving or leave
even under the assumption that his day was a fluke and that his first job was absorbingly more complicate than it had seemed a simple notification of his situation and i probably would have still one business with him
well it does
saturday sunday mondaythey are closed mondayis all i wanted
no worries though  national fixed our bill quickly and i was given excellent customer service
had the guy w the tattoos all over his head and face redo it who actually did a little better
the best service we have received yet renting a car
i couldnt wipe the smile off her face all the way home
left my car with them at 8am and i got a call at 920am the next day telling me my car was finished
i jumped a curb racing an r8
united nissan advertised a 2011 hyundai accent for 10000
once you get there they take you to see the tint options
at their dealership they didnt have any floor mats
awesome experience here
do listen to your customers and answer the question they asked
quick and easy as well
his final number came in at 4000 above his phone estimate otherwise he would have gotten 5 stars  definitely the best in the business but just a little bit expensive just a little bit  not a complaint  i would definitely use him again
i asked if i could get a free ac diagnostic
you can trust them and they will always do the right thing
overall a great dealership
the use of computers while waiting for my car is a nice perk
nothing beats that kind of service
they even show you the dipstick after they change the oil to prove there was no funny business going on
it turns out another seven thousand miles later that not only did they not use screws to properly put the part back on but they used zip ties
decided to find a new mechanic besides the  dealership 45 minutes away for my cars needs and decided to try summerfields
their oil change specials from the website are a good deal too
and the cashier couldnt help
if you need a real hardware store like the ones we all used to rely on and that are our neighbors keeping the revenue in our town and not a faceless orange apron who tries to dodge you and for god sakes never make eye contact
i went to them again with another car problem and i continue to be impressed by their ability to solve any issue at a fair price
i purchased running boards for my mercedes benz glk i made several calls to different mercedes benz dealership and every dealership wanted a ridiculous amount of money
but when i told him that i wanted my money back so i could take it to my dealer he changed his tune  insisted on washing the car
they wont give the actual facts details rates information
dont do business with riverview
very professional not pushy but did maintain a good follow up rhythm based on my feedback
he advised us on our situation and we scheduled our new tire purchase on the day we were leaving town
jump time does have longer more connected trampolines compared to flip dunk
i visit this car wash every time i need to wash my ride
fast service and amanda was very communicative with me about the entire process
took an early acura tsx to them for repair  they resolved that issue and solved a problem that two dealerships could not  excellent prices and service
after the repair was done they delivered the car to my house
we will never come back here ever
thank you for doing such a terrible inspection and allowing me to drive 4 hours on a bad transmission
she said the lady who checked me in must have made a mistake
i get a call from a salesman
i highly recommend these guys
he is an honest man he returned my close to 1300 for the part
played with all the bells and whistles
i was skeptical but needed my windshield replaced regardless so i called and made the appointment
parking is a little tight and at times of heavy traffic can be a pain to get out back on the street but it is in a convenient area if you need to drop in grab a few items and be back on your way
this place needs to be reported to the better business bureau and the state attorney generals office
plus or minus a penny per gallon
that kind of customer service is rare these days and i will be sure to return when its time for new tires
well stocked for a smaller shop but very big in service
did i mention awesome
go visit prem lawrence  he was incredible and went above and beyond to help me feel great about my purchase
also btw i carpool people so im putting them out and losing money from them
im in wow at this point
well let me find out the soonest i can get someone to you and ill call you right back
i went in there today to get my tires checked and see if they were eligible for replacement through my tire package that i purchased through harley davidson and i was told that i did not have a tire package and that hd did not offer tire packages
the waiting area is comfortable and clean
these guys want to give you the best deal possible
my last experience in a cab was a guy that drove around 80 mph yes
ive recommended this place to many of my friends and recommend you try them out
they remembered our names from our last visit
i have a bmw and it can be costly for any slight repairs
we drive past bmw north scottsdale all the way in to phoenix to get our car services  for years
first he said the price was more than i had two coupons one for their business and one from a competitor the coupon for the competitor was 2 cheaper than their coupon
we were told that there was going to be no breaks in the cost because the laborers were the ones suffering
also bought tires here for a great deal
needless to say never again will i do business with them my steering wheel has never bees straight since they installed the rack and pinon
ive never been treated so rudely by a service staff member before
bethanne apparently had something better to do than to check for us
not to mention it was pretty pricey for what you get
he was so rude
i had better things to do with my day and could have made alternative plans than to just sit in your showroom
wesley took the time to explain every feature of the mercedes i ended up purchasing and shows sincere passion for his work
one hour later got a rental
ive known pat and have been referring people to him for over 15 years
as an aside the food is fantastic  blts are the best ive had  even better then when i make them at home
compared to other mechanics ive been to and have heard about sure stop is one of the few remaining places that wont try to nickel and dime you every step of the way
he stated that the truck broke down and he would try to find a contracted carrier and call me back
mind you i was with my family and my step mom is thai
i originally went to diamond because of their 5 star rating on yelp and they more than deserved it
this will be ongoing until the bbb decides the issue is unresolved and then the entire complaint will be available for consumers to view
ive had defective part put on my car 3 times
it took a couple times of me taking it back but he got it
that alone tells you what kind of shadey business they are running
most people would have and would be in some serious crap
i believe he was trying to take advantage of us because we were traveling
i was having trouble with my car so i took it to them they got me checked in and told me they would call when they found the problem
i kept coming back because of the warranty i had on one problem and i would leave with a few more
but well see what happens
i would def recommend this shop to anybody
this dealership seems to be rated only one of two ways  really high or really low
shortly after this my son took my car to school and my car would not start for him
visit the website for their backstory and coupons
they are not only cheaper than the german showroom but are truly sincere in their work compared to how other auto shops rip you off
are you kidding me
attendant was really efficient and friendly
after looking at it the found it was faulty and they didnt charge me
right after i got the car i took it to another dealer to get an extra key made and the service manager told me i got the red carpeti went to lunch and they fixed a couple issues and recalls and changed the oil and said thank you  you owe us nothing
i drive on the freeway quite a bit and get bugs galore on my windshield
ifwhen i go back to this dmv ill update my review but until then im happy enough to go when i have to because i have no reason to dread my visit
didnt think so or they would allow people to set their own time limits to complete their banking without all these problems
i just want to warn readers of yelp that their great reviews are a good indicator of the quality of the place but if you feel something is amiss in the quote or work cited do not hesitate to look for another opinion
i stopped to get a car wash and gas
it was slightly drizzling with rain when we came here but as far as the place goes its quite nice
the last place i got her oil changed had either not tightened the oil filter or used the wrong one
wowat costcoprime beef
if youre paying out of pocket they will do what they can to help you save money
have lost interest and someone seems ready to buy it
you wont find a better mechanic
theyve shut off my infernal service engine soon light with an oxygen sensor
everything was fine until it wasnt
here its at fair prices and you can be assured that you are being taken cared of
i have had my employees and family friends also take their cars in for service
any high end mechanic would have at least suggested this
the mechanic who fixed our car
all i needed was to have the rear view mirror reattached
never over priced and do many different services
my wifes brand new car got plowed into by a snowbird
we had great service and they went the extra mile
so i am generally the kind of person that gives places the benefit of the doubt if i go there once and am not 100 satisfied but i thought the price was decent i will try them again
i tried calling twice today and both times heard a recording that said the person youre trying to call is not accepting calls at this time
the dude was friendly funny and professional
they fixed it but still lost my business
next time i go swimming with my iphone ill be taking it straight here
add in the fact that were transacting the entire deal over text email and fedex and things can get very complicated
it was a 113 degree day and we piled into a non air conditioned outdated bus
new into az with none of my connections in the auto business anymore i picked chapman because they had all the options of vehicles i was considering
i recently went to ae to get new speakers and an ipod hook up for my car
now i need to deduct at least 3 stars as i finally left the dealership at 500 in a filthy car as i could wait no longer
finally by the time i got my car back the air conditioning buttons werent working like they used to
easy to find seating and just a comfortable experience overall
i bought my car three years ago and from the get go it always had a subtle vibration whenever i hit the breaks
i think they could have gone a little farther to right the ship but their actions were adequate
salesman gives one price they tell you that price is only valid if you buy 2000 worth of optional things
i will warn all my friends and family members never ever to go to dannys or now as it is called jackson family car wash  the worst experience ever
he was extremely friendly and helpful but also laid back and easygoing so i felt very comfortable and atease
instantly i was nervous
after i was told all of this i lost all trust with him and this store
dont go here
again seems simple enough but no i get there the next day and get the deer in the headlights look when i tell them what im there for
it was done in about an hour
i have never been more frustrating in just trying to get a refund for a car they couldnt deliverin fact they said that mazda didnt even manufacture a white cx5 with black leather
wanted a 199 shake they had only had oreos
if you need anything from tires oil changes and any other basic car services go here
4 days away to be exact
anyways the manger called us later and gave us an even better deal free oil changes for the lease period which was nice thats why i gave 2 stars instead of one
i 100 agree with everyone else who mentions worst place ever they use scare tactics and will use every trick in the book to get you to pay more
all this happened 62314
so i called to talk to jeremiah saying it was arts fault but he quickly told me it was his fault and he knew he did it
he should be reported to the authorities
if you looking for a kia this is good place to come in and kick some tires
it was recommended to me by a friend and it was the experience i expected and more
they take wonderful care of you with personal service
i am really disappointed about this because when i told them they left my oil cap off and my car started causing problems after i took it there they denied everything and acted like theyd never do such a thing
answered all questions and seems very knowledgeable with what my jeep needs
they pretty much just throw all your groceries around that you spent time carefully picking out and youre paying top dollar for it
i was more interested in getting an oem replacement that would last  be compatible with my rain sensor etc
for future reference just because a female walks into your shop do not assume she doesnt know when a car shop is trying to take advantage of the situation in order to meet your stores daily sales goals
i would never do business with them again
and i hate crowds and have never had a bad experience or had to wait a long time  i wish other stores could be as accommodating and helpful as the staff at the apple store
turns out it was a bad thermostat
the crack ended up spreading and i was furious since i just bought a new 15 dodge charger
annie handled everything for me and she was very friendly and did everything to accommodate my requests
i just showed up at 335p on a monday w2 cars ahead of me  including testing i was on my way 9 min later
you will see the best of packard rollsroyce duesenberg hispanosuiza talbot lago bentley ferrari aston martin bugatti cadillac delahaye delage mercedesbenz maybach horch isotta fraschini pierce arrow minerva plus many more
my car had serious brake problems that required immediate service
adam and cisco are great guys
my insurance company repeatedly tried to recover the money from day and from what i last heard finally settled with them but they were not able to recover my deductible
im in here for consumables and detailing supplies all the time
now i never write reviews but please stay away
we had the time of our lives
cobblestone on pima is the best place to go for fast oil changes as well as car washes
as a woman getting a quote for car repairs always makes me nervous
i believe 14 centsgallon is the average difference in gas prices between those 2 gas stations if anyone was wondering about cheap gas
i just got 2 used excellent condition continental procontact allseason tires installed in 15 min for 60
i called up and spoke with dave and make an appointment 2 weeks in advance
pulled the its normally 89 but well give you 20 off
be prepared to have to argue with your salesperson about this a lot but prevailing financially is worth a little back and forth to me
this was the third purchase i made from an autonation dealership in the past 12 months
there was no wait and the whole process for my car took approximately 20 minutes
he doesnt have a web site that he could update with his everchanging hours
a lousy 25 dollar check
i recieved a call within30 minutes of dropping my car off
he also spent a good amount of time demonstrating the new features and paired both of our phones
she was so wonderful
he was very upfront and honest with me about what was wrong and that he did what he could to fix it and it seemed to work  fingers crossed
i think that is cuz i knew it was a fair price
thank you to service manager frank chayney and crew you guys are awesome
do they even show these people how to clean a simple window
oh flipping sit
i will be a return customer for sure thanks scott
it is now sunday night  four days after she emailed us this nonsense
dave the owner is a very honest and knowledgable mechanic
great job guys keep up the phenomenal work
given that its only a matter of time before someone rear ends you in this town its not a question of if but when i will always go to michaels for my collision needs
they offered a coupon for my oil change and gave me a great selection of tire quotes when asked
all transactions were very smooth and we were impressed
my insurance agent recommended monte at ts and he and the team knocked it out of the park
alfonso helped me out during my visit today
dont go here
we werent fortunate in the beginning because le awd does not last on the lot but he found one for us
good selection of sauces liked the extra extra hot
everything moves quickly and efficiently which is great when you are in a hurry
next came the sales manager richie davidson
not very convincing or professional by any means
i lost jobs and rental car fees due to them taking over a week to put a radiatior on
shortly after booking my uhaul i got a confirmation email
about 30 minutes later raleigh guy called us to apologize for charlotte guy whod just totally forgotten about the appointment
sales pitched to get the chips fixed on your windshield as you pull into a car wash and they dont want to take no for an answer
this is one top notch body shop
pros super friendly staff great quality food fresh ingredients efficient busboys cons small waiting area super small portions way overpriced  tip call way ahead for reservations even like a day or two before or else be prepared to wait we went on a thursday evening like 630ish an hour after opening only waited 30 mins can only imagine if we showed up later
my first time getting my car interior detailed honestly think i made a mistake
a minute later another man comes up and wants to know which car wash i purchased
clean professional courteous and matriculate
almost every time i do there is someone standing at the door asking for money and making loud moaning sounds on your way in and out
if you have anything to do better do it before you go there
at 800a they opened the door and started letting people in
i had to get the tire iron out and put it back on in the middle of the 110 degree heat while my wife was waiting in the restaurant
positive brings good results and thats exactly what you find here
if i lose the other 2 i will take it right back to them
i will be back and would highly recommend you to stop in
im an automotive enthusiast who takes pride in his car
now they take care of my sasha aka 2012 mini cooper i feel at ease however from time to time theres little carelessness
we were in and out of the tire shop in less than 45 minutes and were able to get back on the road soon after
everything was changed and made just like its supposed to be
bill at master automotive is as good as it gets
jim i know this isnt tour fault
i just found out this morning i have to make another trip to pick up the plates i never received due to their clerical error
she said that is another more expensive treatment
this agency totally derailed my trip
well i needed a better solution so i went to ct auto repair based on a recommendation and the reviews on yelp
great service and there always honest
no grumbling no attitude he genuinely wants you to leave his garage satisfied with his service
one of the sales persons told me they have 5 years full warranty for the tires
they will look into it and get a call back from tammy  gives me an excuse that she is new and still no resolution
or me and flipper are gonna kick sum ayass
im sorry it took me this long to finally be getting around to reviewing this place
i read the reviews i was warned but i decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and bought a voucher for my husbands fathers day gift  anna at devons was quick to return my call and answer all questions making me feel very good about my decision  but then on the big dayno show no call and now all we get is vm when we call their office
when i arrived i was greeted and the employee tried to up sell me
he found one of the locks was old and he replaced this with a new one and charged me very little extra
oh well  probably a sign not to buy a car here
they shop around for the best price on parts and always stay true to their quotes
i feel like on a saturday i would typically wait forever
i said no i didnt want him working on it ay more and that i had to leave so i would pay him 100 for the work he had done so far and take the vehicle as it was
recent car repair service no problems fairly priced and no big sales push
they did a better job then any car wash we every went to ever
thank you walmart on pimathank you
they even said if i needed it they could have picked me up from work or from my house in their shuttle to pick up the car
the bed cover on my nissan frontier was fading terribly from the local elements
do not go here
i had a complete engine rebuild with new everything ac fixed blowing strong and cold steering alignment brakes and transmission flush with new filter
tnt used to be my go to
the tradein and purchase experience was fine it took a while but i guess thats to be expected
she said you cant have anything that obstructs your view
they did their magic super fast and for a reasonable price
i should of never had to call upon vegas management to render the situation
there is a 122k model s sitting in the showroom for you to sit in gorgeous tons of leg room but limited headroom but if you want to test drive it you need to get your name on a list
the service department here is staffed by a bunch of crooked liars
on a recommendation i started servicing my vehicle at sun auto on w craig
this work was highly recommended by a dealership  service department
the problem that he diagnosed had nothing to do with the part honda works replaced
the belt had come off the car
now they just dont return our calls
this was with  2028 down and miles allowed was 10500  mr carrington advised robert that he wanted 12000 miles for the same price as the 10500 miles
and holy moly
while you wait you can enjoy a cup of fresh ground coffee hot dog water or pop corn
overall i like it here easy in easy out and the staff is always friendly and helpful
paid 130 for the work and it took about 2 days
during the process of buying the car the pitch was made if you send your friends here you can receive 100 check per referral
also helen was very friendly and helpful
pedro was spot on with everything he told me over the phone
they completely ruined our plans and were willing to do nothing for it
and when i need new tires i know exactly where to go
so if you want good food at a great price and friendly service go to in and out burger
after basically arguing with this rude person i gave up and told him that it was my 4th dodge dealership who refused to work a deal with me and that he was the most ridiculous person ive ever dealt with
the guys wiping down my car have always been nice and thorough with their cleaning
i was never asked about alignment
highly recommend this rental
weve bought several sets of tires here and based on the service weve gotten i plan to continue that
i waited for someone to notice me standing in the front office
thank you dc sound
the manager says i quote we dont know much about cars
best experience we had in purchasing a car
and ron was push push push
since attending their offices on 3 occasions i have found an alternative provider and will not return unless necessary
brian did a beautiful job of tinting my new malibus windows
it goes without saying that these people are complete and utter slime and theyll eventually get what they deserve
upon review of the price i discovered that my budget could not sustain paying for the service
4 slight intermittent engine knock 5 fluids dirty to date invested 1870 vehicle value 4000 1 solved the trannytransfer case leak claimed to check out 4wd shifting smoothness and said it all checked out ok  220
joe the owner personally handled my car in a timely manner
he has a great eye and works fast and has a high emphasis on quality
i bought an suv at usa auto in november 2014 after i specifically told the salesman jr that i needed something safe and reliable because we had a new baby in the family
this is the last type of thing i would want happening to anyone
highly recommend them
it was neither quick or clean
avoid this car wash
they sure lived up to it
the sales contract was made and i saw that they were making about 800 on the car and was probably gonna make 153k on my tradein but that was the best i could do
ask for ken in service hes great
we had them install security film on our house windows with anchoring a year ago and i am happy with their work
they found that all four of my rotors needed to be replaced right front seal leaking my steering box needed replaced
this park and ride is not safe
after finding we would be charged an extra 13 a day more for spouse to drive we walked over to enterprise
thanks so much for all the customer service you provide guys youre awesome
while waiting i asked do you think i can get window tint thrown in and he goes no we really cant add things anymore this after weeks of them emailing me saying what will it take to sell you a car
five stars and then some
got a call from the service advisor saying they would have to run an electrical diagnostic on the jeep because supposedly my aftermarket led lights and the tire air pump was wired into any available harness on the jeep
he finally wrote us up and took our keys
i do fault them for having some sort of email server where email gets lost but at the same time i could have also called and i could have figured this out
i waited almost 3 hours before i saw my truck which after coming out of the wash rack was still dirty and had dirt smeared across the doors from the towel dry
i have used them for 2 years and several repairs to my 2009 a8
awesome helpful friendly work done right thoughtfully considered our budget in repair needs
great service today
the pick up area was not well lit so that limited my inspection of the body work
the only punishment for that is not buying from the dealer again and posting this review
on the few occasions that we have needed to leave our car there for a day or two they have always given us a ride home after dropping the car off and picked us up when it was time to pick up the car
had to clean the floor so my sons shorts didnt get pee all over them and had to clean the toilet seatgross
my daughter worked very hard to get this vehicle and honestly if we could return it we would
they did not mention this prior to doing the paint job but after they simply said this is the closest youll get
the salesman told me that the car was taken in about a week ago and they have not had time to clean it yetseriously
the employee took 5 minutes per tire on the first car before i decided to leave
upon inspection i noticed my rims paint is all chipped and cut up where the guy used the pry bar to get my tired off of the rim
i had a very pleasant experience here
my battery died 2 months later
a couple of days later a 1 man repair shop in another town diagnosed it and repaired it in under 5 minutes
we started googling what to do and came across upholstery works and found out we surly werent the first to have this happen too anyway they were very friendly and had amazing customer service
i especially like the habanero north carolina and the xxx varieties
james and his crew did a fantastic job on my acura mdx
and gave me a huge break on price so for this reason
if you have to go to dmv make an appointment online
do not waste your money
by the time it got here it was filthy with dead bug juices and dirt all over
had a crack right across the windshield
you look me i the eye on a saturday and tell me you dont have time for an emissions test
i rarely use the word awesome to describe anything but i was left with that feeling after spending three hours at shelby american saturday june 13 2015 the facility is immense clean and inviting
love this place its quick and easy
i called in advance and they were able to look it up our warranty and they honored it without any hassle
so here i am waiting 45 minutes along with my fellow car renters in line which now was at 10 people waiting for these two agents to services two people one each and then both decided to walk away from the desk leaving the counter completely empty of agents to intake the customers
i really thought hard about taking it back within the 3 days that you can just because of the treatment i received from him
if i could leave 10 stars i would definitely do it
i was willing to rent a car but after 40 min i couldnt even talk to the service advisor kevin gjerstad who was just there in the phone and ignoring me like i wasnt even there not even acknowledging me
you read above right
the showroom is sharp and open i swear that didnt influence my choice too much
whoever is managing this dealership should be proud of their team
after spending an almost 12 hour day searching for a used vehicle i had a limited time frame  an even more limited budget ben at mark mitsubishi found me my new car
ross the salesman was very professional and loads of help
i have made four trips to the dealer and assured the window and leak had been fixed only to find within 10 miles down the road the latch broke again and was flapping in the wind
the driver jeff just told me to suck a dk like i always do
i assumed that the price was just for parts but it included labor
they did an amazing job for a really great price
quick and easy with plenty of spots for car washing and vacuuming
well i drive past this place everyday going to work and back home and it had been two years since my last visit there which was not good at all
they were fast and efficient as well as friendly and professional
i love this shop its be best its clean its honest and the technicians are very knowledgeable
the owner struck me as kind honest and a small business owner looking to impress new customers and build his business
however this particular location on jones and tropicana has seemed to fall in the hands of lane and his band of 40 thieves
it was a lie too
its been almost 2 months already and second i just need to confirm my warranty dates
basically they thought my car was in poor condition even though it did not match any description of poor condition
the rep spoke to her boss and raised the amount on their 2nd quote to total 300
plus they repaired some other plug where the wiring was failing at no charge
can i give less then 1 star
the process was easy considering we had been all over town trying to get approved for financing with no luck on getting an acceptable interest rate payment or down payment amount that would fit our budget
this is a great place for a nascar fan whether you support 5 2448 andor 88 or not
a lot of auto shops would have added a charge to the bill for doing the work within such a short window of time but that wasnt the case with honest1
the young man who handled my hand wax pulled the car out into the sun afterward and went around to check to make sure everything was wiped down  an eye for detail i definitely appreciated
i have been to this location twiceonce in august to have my air conditioner repaired and today
i purchase the managers special with an upgrade to make my wheels look good and my car in the end was dirty as the moment i came in
there is an occasional awful noise that i didnt know if it was my shocks or something loose
the woman on the phone was the most incompetent person i have ever had the displeasure of talking to
their super loud alarm would go off for a frw minutes then stop for a while then go off again
everything was done same day and i am ready to ride
about a half hour later they called me back and said they needed to reschedule me to thursday because they needed 2 hours to tint my vehicle so i agreed
needless to say im getting my oil change and everything else that involves my vehicle done there from now on
joe is a great guy and very helpful
2 weeks later my husband noticed the registration sticker was up guess when the last day of june
so instead of doing the basic which was the 99 i upgraded
scott is the best sales person and my wife had her best experience ever
although the process was the usual tiring process to get the price where we needed to be but it was well worth the wait
they told me they tested the calipers and sleeves and everything was in working order
these guys are amazing
i guess he didnt wantneed my business
i will be calling and talking to the manager hopefully can salvage something
anyway im very thankful
i admit i was nervous but i am a happy person so i sat there and chatted with customers and staff
would i come back
vw customer care is also useless
how long can this guy possibly take
we have zag pricing through usaa which is a predetermined price for the vehicle and its only a few hundred over invoice
so i headed to their place which is located at the sheppard centre underground parking
didnt try to sell me everything
keep up the good ethics
they knew what we wantedneeded and rather than look for the answer they just spewed what we wanted to hear even though it was incorrect
i told 5 different employees that it doesnt reverse so when it comes out the wash make sure they pull forward in the front of the line
unfortunately for him after saying that he had to walk me around a large delivery truck blocking most of the side of the building in order to show me a window cling mixed in with about 10 other window clings selling various other items
and dont get your coffee there
took my car to the toyota dealer to sell
5 the customer service was great
because of my recent exceptional experience with getting my toyota serviced by toyomotors i recommend my friend to get her vehicle serviced by toyomotors
they told me if i didnt service my brakes with them they would take my vip status away from me
this was my first accident and to be honest i was worried about how the repairs would go
this place is awesome
im not sure how we got so lucky to find him but if i were you i wouldnt go anywhere else
many of these finishline kids were just lollygagging and halfaing it through their shift
they obviously did not like their job and i could tell by the tone of her voice that i was wasting their time
umberto was a character but he did end up finding a solution that cost me less money than my quoteand was honest about it and i wouldnt have been able to tell if he hadnt told me
twice within a 3 week period i have attempted to have glasses made for myself at this costco optical center
it wouldve been less but they fixed the problem that had my check engine light on as well
i have bought 2 vehicles from here and the reason has always been the service dept
they have great customer service
i called and spoke to chris
they initially told me there was pick up available on the last week of may but up until the day before the estimated pick up day i had not heard from tfx
thanks  brandon sevruk
when the driver finally found the registration the employee took it and said thats what i asked for awhile ago
they where really useless and did not have a clue what they where doing
the more we got to know each other the better the service and prices got
you wont be disappointed
i live on the north west part of vegas  but  i will still drive to nates cause of the service  thank you
and to do that you almost have to dismantle the entire door
and since then i been there twice once for a repair on my motorcycle and once to see about trading my bike in for another one and since i bought my bike i have not liked ridenow powersports
and she was like yes i can hear you hello
i came into today for a scheduled oil change appt at san tan ford  cody told me it would be no longer then 1 hr  30 at 2 hours i asked him what was taking so long  he said they were slammed
i was going to have my local best buy install it but they were backed up for weeks
i always get good service from this place  i have been in the market of buying a motorcycle for a bit but i am waiting until i find the right bike at the right price
good work we had to come back the next day now  we ended up getting a payment almost 100 over what we wanted but after spending two days here i was over it and just wanted to get the car and get out
she was professional and informative
there are a few things that you must find when you move a good dentist good doctor and a good mechanic
after the associate insisted i had come to the wrong branch i insisted on him looking up the part history by part number and he found my order
actually it wasnt bad from an objective standpoint either
so when i went into this dealership i went straight to the service director jack farris
excellent thai food
no new tire required
french fries and hamburgers have the potential of falling between the seats making a mess on the floor and hard chore to clean up for me
the car wash was actually half way decent especially the interior job
i had to point out obvious places that had to be touched up where i never had to before
go try one out
the radio was turned all the way up so my son was blasted by the volume
they never try to upsell you  in fact just the opposite
they made my car look totally different
they were able to get my windows pretinted by my choice tint person
it was always such a relief
are they trying to run it like a 5 stars restaurant when the  smell of roaches waft in the air and foods are subpar at best
die weine stimmen knnten aber besser sein
have been coming here after being ripped off by fletcher jones on a serviceb on my 2012 e350
after going through the wash i pulled up to the fullservice station where several guys started vacuuming my seats polishing the exterior etc
thanks again to jc and his friendly professional staff for taking excellent care of us
one mechanic pumped out the excess and looked not so happy
i let them know exactly how they are doing
ramon is a straight shooter
my salesmanpedro and lawrence ennis were awesomevery personable and honest to a fault
below are the before and after pictures
youd never even know he was there except for that beautiful new tint
good job findlay
i was told the front motor mount was leaking
sky harbor airport parking is my go to place to park when flying from sky harbor
went to safeway this morning for gas and the first thing im doing from work is writing this review
i was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the store
david danisi always greets me with a smile and assures me my car is in perfect hands
no hassles no trying to haggle out of their end of the contract
when at first open they were real friendly and helpful now they act like robots  from the moment you walk in till you het out
i specifically explained that my main concern was the inside
but no they all stayed over time and pulled it off
i called made an appointment and gave the salesman the stock
they were extremely busy
it reminds me of the hobby shop that used to be on base
he made my experience of the free truck service smooth and easy
job well done for my stereo install
want cheap gas
i did a little research on them and they are totally on the up and up
due to having to wait for the additional work i got back on the road much later than i had hoped
ill definitely be backdespite the fact that they were able to get my car cleaned up after all these years i dont plan on waiting that long to do a full detail again
bring my vehicle here everytime
extreme disappointment in the manner in which my transmission leak wasnot handled
every truck stop i have stop at has always provided a hair dryer so we dont have to go outside with wet hair
cant begin to explain how rude and unprofessional the lady in here was to me and my boyfriend
poutine from costco is good
they are always honest on what you need and charge a reasonable price
i know they are going to quote me a fair price and the work perform is going to be at a higher level than any other place in town
this is a small business that will turn you into a repeat customer
when the car did not sell within the time frame they came and picked it up and gave me a check
everybody wants to know how the cochran vw car inspection fiasco turned out
apparently he believes everybody should be a mechanic but but fortunately i dont have to be a mechanic i chose to call bill luke because the other jeep dealership in avondale turned out to be extremely rude as well i figure this is just how the jeep dealerships work nobody is held accountable for anything at these places you can ask to be transferred to somebody else like i did in avondale and the service manager just made a bunch of excuses why it was ok for them to be rude to me as a customer even though i overpaid for a vehicle from their lot the last time i added a review from yelp for one of the jeep dealerships it was deleted within a few days im not sure how these places get the yelp reviews deleted but they definitely are able to delete them so every time he gets deleted ill have to go back on and repost and ill do this as many times as it takes for people to know and see how rude these people are to the customers
she just wants to hug that bunny so much
after four hours and about to close the deal i noticed a new 250 fee that was not there before and we had already agreed what the fees would be
through all of it the staff has always been patient pleasant and trustworthy
a preliminary contract was written and we were told that the recon fee would add 1800 to the price
i never got said call and worried that they had not cancelled my membership i called back today
we ended up renting one of these slingshots for 24 hours
when i was in the shop he had everything from classic car efi to modern fuel injected monsters
at this branch the shaded parking is fantastic the outdoor full service driveup window a plus
7 walk in front to get that viewpoint and notice this looks cloudy
im glad to have discovered this location because of their team
is unfortunately not practiced enough in my corporations today
an honest business that cares about there customers
im always offered a loner vehicle if the service is more than just an oil change
we live in a world now where people kill and stalk others for whatever their reasons
a hazard light cluster button not working
still not happy there is no snack bar
i went back and everything was done very quickly
autozone put me through so many trials and tribulations just to get a quart of oil for my car
i decided to go ahead and invest in the ceramic tint offering and i have not regretted it one bit
they have converted me from bmw
anyone in vegas who has custom wheels into stance etc goes to alex because hes a wizard on rack
the artwork came out fantastic
sleazy salesmen highpressure pitches and ridiculous rounds of negotiations usually make for a rather unpleasant experience
i was surprised
the prices its auto repair nothing really comes cheap
excellent service from this dealership and from rico the internet sales manager who sold me 2 cars this year
barry even insisted on helping me get my futon in to the unit when he saw that i was by myself
apparently their people did not read the paperwork and were near complete with the repair by the time the estimator got there so now i have to pay them to get my car
we decided we wanted to go back and get our money back
thank you kindly
the price on the estimate itself was competitive with other shops in the area but not the lowest
patrick was great
had i not read any yelp reviews prior to going i wouldnt have thought twice about my experience
you would sacrifice all the items mentioned above for great quality to ensure your porche remains in the best hands
he also said it was hard to tint my back window because it was curved
findlay honda is no exception
wayne suggested starting off smaller  less expensive with over 200000kms i dont expect the car to run like it did when it was new but wayne and his team sure got it close
i cannot believe i ended up at this hell hole
he was so nice
this is absolutely the best pizza in deforest
especially since this family is hard working and genuine which is so rare to find
it is in dire need of an extreme makeover
so now i have a skid plate full of oil leaking all over my driveway and i have to pull the plate and fix their inability to be professional
as this was the second new honda we purchased this year i can definitely say that the car buying experience at right honda and with kareem is much more pleasant than at other dealerships
which i believe if san tan did see this puncture they should have replaced this tire because i recently had to replace that tire due to an old puncture and i got the road side hazarded coverage on it which i felt if they found a puncture they should have just swapped it out for a new one
highly recommend ordering this soup dish
this dealership not only had great prices but also kept all of their online promises
not too invasive yet not too rushed
the bumper had been pushed in so far the belly pan is damaged the trunk lid crushed in and the bumper mangled
there is also an on premise mechanic to help with oil changes and maintenance
in fact i called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because i changed my email address and couldnt get into the site online
well be back
we will not be doing business with them as we are completely devastated over the situation
was first annoyed that no pricing visible you have to wait for the sweaty heavy breather to pull out a price chart and make a quick decision
basically all of the reasons you dont take your car to the dealer for service
if you are looking for a mechanic that takes pride in his workmanship and is a fair and honest businessman then justin rubino would be your man
so happy to find an honest repair shop
almost 2 hours later and my car was finally done
and the best part they wont actually yell at you if you happen to maybe not be the best at taking care of your carsjust saying
i bought 4 cars from this dealership and with in a year and a half it all broke down and i never got the chance to use my warranty that im paying for because they said that the parts or whatever was wrong with the car is not coveredthey told me they will send me a check for all the troubles they gave me for going back and forth just to get my car fix but i never got the check and its been a year that they made me waitthey said they sent it but i knew they were lyingi used to send all my family and friends to this dealership because i want to give them business but i found out that couple of the cars they bought had problems too so that made me and them not a happy customersso if youre gon buy a carmake sure u dont go to this dealership because you will regret itthe best recommendations is through word of mouth and for mei dont want yall to experience what i went througheverything was just a big disappointment with findlay acura
the best part
please do yourself a favor and dont go here
never pushy with add on services or products that i didnt want or ask for and i love the 1400 off coupon as well
duh its brand spanking new
came here for some basic maintenance but they do everything here from basic bodywork wheels and tires upgrades and performance parts
they have horrible customer service if they arent making alot of money off your tire service then they do not want to service it at all
after phoning in advance as all of the website and yelp sites claim the car wash is open 24 hours i had the privilege of filling up my tank and then found a cone blocking the car wash which i was both told was open and was advertised as open
jj ordered it over the phone for me however the store that showed it was located at didnt have the part in stock
david burton has owed me 300 for scrapping my bike at freedoms choice since september 2015 he refuses to pay using excuses including the bank losing the check having a sickness in the family and the shop being robbed
for a 50k car it sounds like a 5k yugo and spends as much time in the shop as a 10k used pinto
also the little punk who gave me my keys is lucky he didnt get slapped cause when he took my keys he had the audacity to say ill take the tip not so fast there little guy where is his momma at could i would like to slap her too
john the service rep was really nice
thank you steve job well done
dan lives and breaths european cars which makes him an expert and very skilled at what he does
ended up canceling the tow since they had already tied me up for an extra couple of hours then they had promised
i am forced to park in the designated handicapped spot in the rear
im back to ordering some white out for a job that was specially to match up some old aswf white out film
in fact the previous review doesnt really make sense
i found everything i was looking for and more
we were told to wait and wait and wait
this gas station doesnt accept debitcredit cards
nice family business with reasonable prices
i decided i would check it out myself since im new to the neighborhood and i couldnt have been more pleased
the sales manager carlos who initially threw out that 15k number was now working a different obviously more nefarious angle
at this time if you have a two seater you and your partner could switch off
the car wash is mediocre
very accommodating of my schedule
to me this indicates that my efforts have saved people if even just one person from making the same grave mistake that me and countless others have made
set me up with an appointment the same at at 2pm
it hasnt gotten fixed and it hasnt been a month
do not trust them with your car
he worked with me in explaining what was most important to get done and worked it out so i could afford it
i needed my brakes worked on and i work around the corner so when i found this place i wanted to try it
another 750 later the issue was still not fixed
at volkswagen dealership they had car loaners
there is a air conditioning waiting area with snacks drinks and stuff for your car to purchase
and my god is he a sight for sore eyes
they noticed that the air intake on my car was loose so they showed me and said they would tighten it up
he had a potential 95000 in sales with us
thank you to the staff at new look collision
they arent out to sell the biggest and most expensive all the time they  will tell you what is best for you and your family after you explain exactly what you are looking for
was pretty sure it was vacuum related but dont have the time or patience to figure that out myself
jay ride in my car also noticed and agree to replace it
hence the 400 miles they put on itand keeping it for almost 2 weeksso when i finally got the car backit seemed alrightlittle did i knowthat they did absoloutely no tune upserviceor oil change like every dealer is supposed towhen you buyt he change oil light came on 1 day lateri checked the oil and it was lowthe car takes synthetic oilwhich ranges from 60 to 80 per changet he battery died 2 days after salethe repair man lied and said i left the dome light oni have never even used the dome light because this happened right after i  got it back from the firstin the series of repairsand had not even driven the car at nightor for more than 4 hours
the only reasons i didnt give a 5 star review is because they were not too attentive to our empty drink glasses  we had to ask for 1 drink twice
i now know to check the windows and not depend on any company to care about my safety
i told them to check the rotors and machine them as necessary
to me that says a lot about a place of business
i saw two charges for 99 per car as i had fueled them here two consecutive days one receipt i kept the other one went missing so i immediately called my card
about an hour later a service man from bmw north scottsdale was at my office to pick up the car and switch out the tire
no flaws no overspray and the fender was as silky smooth as the rest of the car
take your car here if you have any problems
they dont sell ice at the marina store
they gave me a loaner car for the couple of hours because i had to leave and that lady was great to work with also
we were told all the loaners were gone and the girl who made our reservation listed us as a wait
i recently purchased an audi and i took it in for service because the check engine light came on after driving a few miles
he phoned us as soon as the paint came in as promised
unfortunately the servers brought us the bill without offering us dessert
an oil change that took over a hour to service
maybe they are that way because its hard to get fired there and they know it
like a chip the size and darkness of a house fly annoying me right in the line where my drivers eye goes through the windshield got reduced to the size of a pepper speck so my naked eye no longer latches onto that fly with annoyance
yeah i also had a pretty brutal experience at this location
whereas infiniti of scottsdale gave me 14 options to choose from
the sales guy who met me at the door said it was in service
after said mechanic did the work i brought it over to franks for inspection and emissions
except the way hed written it it worked out to 7500 a month over the term
and they came the same day i called as time permitted
my mother is older so it is helpful for things to be fully explained to her
that being said here was my experience i got a motorcycle after taking the safety class
no back and forth
really cant beat it
he refunded me 203 which included diagnosis and ckp sensor replacement sensor
for thai food in las vegas this is really the only place to go
i bought a groupon for inspection on a brand new car a year old
not that think this place will survive much longer anyway
friendly and the shuttle is helpful
location aside the thai food at this location is out of this world
i like the tires and the price otherwise it wouldve been one star instead of two
two things about me 1 i am not mechanically inclined 2 patience is not my virtue so i want this thing fixed right away
i had a lot of dog hair and jesse took him time and pretty much vacuumed all of it out of the car
have a great vacation
the first few times i used cochran were not as bad but it was still a hassle
this place is definitely not a quick stop for gas
fixed my truck within an hour
the air conditioner was not working and i was dreading crossing death valley without ac
the more i think about my experience with fletchers this is the impression i am left with
i will never recommend this location or kia at all due to this experience
im used to making friends with my service advisors so its kind of a bummer these guys weirded me out more than anything
i as well have been taking my vehicles to frank honest auto
made an appointment and took it in
which was a lie to our faces
the only issue we had involved their subcontractor who installed the windshield
my ac motor is not working in my car
hmmm what can i say about a gas station chainwell this location is right after the canadian border which is good if you waited to refuel at almost a dollar a gallon less a gallon than our neighbors north
im thrilled with the service i received and look forward to being a good customer in the future
they spent a bunch of time talking to me about my car and the acoustics andor logistics of where to put the slightly larger sub
super easy to work with and andy made me feel comfortable that he would take care of my truck
they lie they pressure they make you feel as though there is no other option
so glad you are proud of being leed
our drinks arrived in 8 oz
the reason for 2 stars service dept
no issues here
you knew you were in good hands after talking with her
i think insurance preferred autoshop is a better choice
that was 9 days ago and no response
but they do a pretty good job so its worth the wait
had an awesome night sleep the first time we tried it camping
they are dragging out this operation for almost 3 months now to get my money back to me
just keep in mind that once you run the credit application and if you dont buy right away you will get several phone calls from different people
i realize that not all tires are created equal but i got a comparable tire to what the dealership had put on and added the hazard for a few hundred dollars less
the customer service has picked up since my last review
i would give them a zero stars if i could
highly recommend his services for sure the best in town
i shouldnt have to ask for a service i am paying for
its very busy and thats hard to shop if you have only a few items wish list have a checker for 10 or under items please
i had a flat tire on monday and thought i had bought my tires from big o so thats where i headed
if youre looking for an excellent honest mechanic
when i got in my car they had vacuumed my mats and left a flower on my passenger seat with a thank you card
grab a 20lb bag of limes 5 liters of agave nectar and you are ready to margarita it up
called my insurance company because my work truck needed to be towedmy insurance sent me 777 towing at 1st who by the way have the worst customer service didnt tow my truck and left me strandedi had to call my insurance company again and they sent me this companythe driver of commerce auto towing was excellent and very friendly a on customer service towed my truck wout any issues
after going around with them a while i left when they said that they couldnt come close to my top line of 350 per month with 3000 down
the guy was trying to up sell me on everything i just wanted and oil change
he comes out to you gets the job done in a timely fashion and is super nice and personable
brenda showed me several subarus and we did a test drive
as i pulled into the parking lot i expected to see inconsistent gaps paint marks black trim pieces painted over tape marks a different colored sagging rear bumper all the things i experienced at service king however my car was perfect
always stellar service but this time they completely out did themselves
so my take is if youre expecting to go in and get serviced by some polo wearing pc principal youll be disappointed
i recently bought nature clean unscented hand soap and now need a good source for that too
hmmmmm now about the service department
scott said the car would be finished by following friday at the latest as parts had to be ordered for the sunroof
i cannot tell you how much it means to have a car guy that we can trust
if you dont like it call another ford of just wait until they come
then the sales guy calls me and saysi cant remember what i said  i know what you said because thats why i bought the vehicle
i recently took my juke in for its first oil change and it was easy and painless
like i said on my other review this is by far the best dealership to go
jeremy made sure they had a loaner vehicle ready for me and my car would be returned same day with all work complete
i paid the automated machine and a guy slowly walked up to the spot where id put my wheel into place as if i was taking time out of his day
ive been in town for 32 years now and first was recommended to ted wiens in the early 1980s when they were downtown
and my last post on 212015 was 4 stars
other than that the interior was wiped down and vacuumed and the windows were all sparkling
still i accepted the deal because i could now apply what was to be my down payment to higher interest loans and the interest rate was now 479 per the finance manager
the staff is very knowledgable and has never let me down
paid to get a synthetic oil change that includestire rotation fluid fill and filter change that was post on the wall with price
i emailed the company at 10pm that night and chase personally called me the next morning
john jay is not thinking about his short term bottom line but knows i will tell everyone and come back time and time againjohn jay is the honest mechanic we all hope for
this place deserves a 0 my cousin and i came here to fix our car and they said 1000
it took a while to get the car clean and the paperwork done but i guess thats to be expected when you purchase a car
overall very satisfied with my experience here
while i was waiting a man came in and got his quote completed before mine
some things i fell for others i knew were total crap but overall i know i was screwed repeatedly and it got to the point where i would get physically sick to my stomach when i knew an oil change was coming up
the veginator which i had was on a ciabata bun
my mom went to this car wash and the machine stalled while her car was in the process of washing
zero  zero  zero
jen stamps doug and the rest of the team were amazing
if your looking for service look for danny
i went to the parts counter first looking for a simple plastic trim fastener used for reattaching the door panel on my jeep
so expect a call from me soon
in july i brought a 2013 subaru xvcrosstrek love the vehicle and sherri was the best and the financial department were superb but i havent even had my first oil change since i got it and i was told i need brakes and rotors
you will not be disappointed
the service rep did not mention anything about charging me for them to inspect my car thats still under warranty
one of the best examples of customer service ive dealt with
not only did i get no response while i sat there on saturday morning but as of now noon on tuesday no one from voc has bothered to 1 apologize for wasting my time 2 apologize for not alerting the people with scheduled appointments that the service dept
he made sure i knew everything about the car and how to use it before i left
i needed to write an update as i am disappointed in one thing i was told in regards to the 90 days same as cash
which makes me wonder about the process in which you handle your customers
micah and adam made the car buying process so easy and there was no pressure
wouldnt go there on a date but definitely go back for some filling barbeque
they are very honest and truly appreciate their help to me with my car
ez and advantage rent a car have a combined counter at the phoenix airport
excellent excellent excellent experience here
your midas touch really keeps our car running after so many have told us to give up and get rid of it
the appliance did get fixed
the reason for my last review is that repairs take weeks to complete
blamed it on a program issue and not having updated software to fix it
i decided it was time to trade in my 1999 lexus for something new and improved
turns out i did not need an alignment and went on my way
i dont want to mention any names or anything to bad
i tried getting up several times and finally told him i dont want to waste his time
the car also was returned to me with a full tank of gas
so i went back today giving the benefit of the doubt knowing that people to have a bad day once a while i went to the store with a small piece of exhaust asking if they can bell it  out little bit which i know they have a machine and i know they  it
tad and rob were excellent to work with
one call to junior my sales guy and all the fixes were handled in a professional and timely manner
either misdiagnosis or fraud either wy dont trust
tj m was my salesperson and he was super friendly and knowledgeable
recently we needed to put a hitch on our daughters truck after  checking rates we found that uhaul was the best price the work was one quickly
we proved on our bank site payment comes out every month on the 24th
i have purchased 2 jeep vehicles from this dealership over the past 6 years first a wrangler and then a grand cherokee
he explained and educated me with the different packages
i dropped my car off at noon and received a call by 1230 with results
i went back to meineke outlined the facts showed them the documentation from ford and asked for the following compensation from the 1500 worth of work they had done  6300 for missbilling of credit card looks like someone transposed the numbers and billed the card for 892 instead of 829 on the initial visit  27142 reimburse of the alignment and the labor associated with the install of the camber bushings
glad i finally found a decent place to get my vehicles smogged up the road from where i live in the future
they finished the work i paid and left on my journey
she offered to put us at the end of the line are you kidding me i just spent 4 hours here and left without my son getting his permit
if you get their tires get the roadside insurance with the tires
this is pretty much the definition of bait and switch
talked with john who was very friendly and honest about the work that would most likely need to be done and the worst case price
came in asked for the cheapest oil change
the guus were so accommodating
ive been using dannys for a few years now and im more then a little sad at my experience today
the rate would be 85
was in and out in 5 minutes
if you supported me in any way you can as you say then i would not have had to file the lemon law claim to begin with
canadian tire even has a stand alone gas station right outside this location
i left them with access to my home while i went back to la and i never once worried
basically its the only entrance which makes waiting for a car in the lobby or on the patio kind of unpleasant
ryan hooked it up great job guys
make no mistake professional window tinting is an art these guys are artists
i looked up the other blades and grabbed those too
i also told them about my back up camera that it flickered every now and then
ive used brake masters for oil changes for over 5 years and recently moved to a new area
we were scammed by this guy
moving long distance is full of surprise mishaps that can be costly
after going through multiple managers and more additional wait time they finished up all our paperwork
what a pleasant change from the way many business operate these days
s depending where you live but i can assure you youll know youll be treated fairly and wont have to worry about getting ripped off like 910 of shops out here in vegas
thanks for paying for my rental though
kip cut the film clean right to the edge of  the windows with no blemishes  on top of that the pricing was great
kevin said he wanted to take a quick look under the hood and quickly told my son they might have him out of the shop quicker than expected
called him later that day to schedule an appointment and was able to get in the very next day
the people are great and helpful
i probably will go somewhere else next time
the wrecker was able to jump me off but i decided to drive to the dealership anyway
all the employees dont like being there just look at their face when you go in therelike a zombies
i am giving them four stars for giving me the correct information
one thing that was another warning sign was they had recharged the ac unit recently
the most absolute expensive and worst car wash ive ever had done to one of my vehicles
this time a delightful young lady who was too busy texting rear ended my q5 while stopped at a light
and i loved their price
like other reviewers said they take very  long after the actual wash and afterwards the car is still not as clean as they used to get it dirty seats poorly vacuumed floors etc
i have to laugh because ive swapped out my headlight on my own before
there was a lapse in communication that wasnt his fault  the manager should have told everyone
just a switch out simple enough
i scheduled an appointment in advance through their website
the next day i get in my car to go to a meeting im facilitating and it has permanently locked me out of starting my car
called them for wind shield replacement
i told him i had a vehicle full with family that i was in a hurry and that they wanted to sit in two different vehicles to see what felt best
i was quoted 240000 for a rebuilt transmission and brake rebuild
it was an expensive lesson to learn but i will never set foot in this place again and will steer any friend i have away from this dump
they have always been fair when it came to trade in values and always did everything they could to get us into the vehicle we wanted and at a price we could afford
bill my finance guy was extra special too
i wouldnt expect anything less coming from an earnhardt dealership
are the devices they sell pricey
oil change tire rotation engine flush and antifreeze top off
thought golf carts would have assisted for the pricey fee they charge to valet
i would be very wary when signing anything at this dealership
i will for sure be a repeat customer as well as recommending your shop to others
i called it to our salesmans attention
definitely not full service
when i finally got my truck back five days later  they blamed the tire distributor and didnt offer me any credit for four days of inconvenience caused by their  lack of attention to detail
yes i just crossed those three things
peter is a consummate professional
the cars are given filthy dirty
equally as important i feel like they dont try to sell you but really try to help you and find more cost efficient repairs then always replace everything
told the driver i needed to be to the airport and he ignored my urgency and ran around the city picking random people up while almost re ending traffic on whitney way texting on his ipad
it is situated inside a half closed strip mall that has 4 korean bbq places a korean grocery store a saloon that was pretty hoping at 430 on a sunday and the green door
office staff is also very polite and accommodating
he stands firm without being pushy
i will never go back to alamo car wash
love that theres other non employees working here theyre employees of the brands they represent example samsung apple microsoft
i agreed and waited for the service to be completed
was just at the dealership and wanted to purchase a new f250
their prices and labor rates are always fair
daryl did an excellent job for me on my vintage mercedes
the car wash was good but as for the inside detailing im way less than impressed
i finally visited this facility and i had a great time
i will keep my unit here for the 2 months i have am supposef to have it gor
which to me thats fine
their sandwiches are phenomenal and the lady that works there is a babe
when i got home the unit did not even open up to allow access to the cd player
in all they are great to their customers and i am so thankful that they helped me
there are other nearby dealerships getting 4 and 5 star reviews
theres a line right there
great authentic thai food
we have had repairs that we planned out and it took 6 months to complete based on the money we had available
over 3 hrs for oil change and tire rotation
i couldnt make it that day but she called back to check in with me on how the car looked and if i came in
in december i had taken my old truck to have the radio and remote start removed
in about an hour  later they call me up and say that it would be 158 on top of what they originally quoted me  which was 79 for the alignment for a total of 238 plus tax
stay away from these guys
theyre the best in bc as far as im concerned i have used others over my 18 years here and finally found them and will remain
was actually disappointed with the dish featured on the show but everything else was wonderful
i asked to speak to manager
ill be back
if you have a bmw and want excellent service give steve a call
i was very happy with what they offered  it was about 1000 more than i what i expected for my 2004 rav4
my sales inquiry came through the ecommerce email and alan responded and he just happened to be the volt expert at the dealer
great guys to deal with and very happy with end result
bottom line is this isnt our last vehicle purchase but it will be from findlay north and any findlay dealerships
the guy who called me supposedly was with another customer and they put with me with somebody else
his techs did another diagnostic evaluation and there was nothing wrong with the o2 sensor or any other part of the car
tk the desk manager also warmly came to introduce himself
transmission fluid changed in advanced and good advice for keeping it that way
full attention on your car
if any part of the service is unsatisfactory the manager will immediately make it right
they look in their system and they claim this was not the repair completed in january
this place is wonderful
this happens to be the closest place for me to fill up my car and get it washed but i would go anyway
theyve helped me out of a few binds and offer low prices
whomever the woman is in the mornings is extremely lovely and sweet though
the prices are competitive and the quality of work is amazing
youll get great service and youll probably be pleasantly surprised by the cars
is that maybe why this company doesnt accept credit cards but will pass along a fee to debit card users
i will never go anywhere else
worth getting but as i said before  he was again speaking to the wrong purchaser so i opted to buy it from edit the next day
thank you for a very easy and smooth trade in and sell
very helpful and quick to get to work
this place has lost all my business and my friends business as of now
they were amazing royal sun alliance  through bruce stevenson
it wasnt ready by friday it wasnt ready by monday
went in and the sales pitch started which i hate
ridiculous attitude for a car sales person given they earn a living by being nice to customers
i just purchased a brand new vehicle and was worried about the type of machines they used due to my previous car getting scratched up so justin beck was very helpful and actually took the time to explain to me how everything worked and gave me reassurance that my car would be pristine which was true
gab and his team give me the best service as well as factory parts only
they also found that i had a nail and bulge on the inside of my left rear tire which i didnt notice being that the bulge was on the inside
i put off calling to get my windshield replaced because i thought it would be a hassle and long phone call
it is nice to have a service provider that you can trust and feel good about working with
i bought the ultimate wash with the 7 day guarantee
i am sorry
i worked with kyle during my whole experience of getting my engine rebuilt
i again kindly told her that i had already made an appointment that im planning to stick with and honor the commitment that ive made
i know where to take my ferrari in the future
in less than an hour he had my rims looking like they did when i bought the car
make a long story short i am 100 satisfied and happy with my 2017 slingshot
showed up talked to lee was introduced to spencer who went on the test drive and did the sales stuff with me
i had to come back the next day
based on the parts diagram darren ordered the correct replacement part but when it arrived it was a different size than the original part
friendly and accommodating
i was very disappointed as a long time attendant at monterey ca auctions during car week in august
now that is some service
the pads were changed over and everything was done very quickly total time there was no more than about an hour and that was with a few other vehicles being worked at simultaneously
thank you for the great test drive experience
i love this place
thanks for making it easy
anyways he changed the other wiper and i paid and went on my way
again youll be hard pressed to find better customer service at an auto shop
in and out in about an hour
wait is not too bad since the last time i went it took them 45 mins and the second time took 1 hr 27 mins from the time the service manager grabbed my keys to the time they handed it back to me bottom line is they are really friendly their price is great
if your ac freon is too low to engage the compressor johnny will insist the compressor is frozen
and pssafelight wanted to change me 100 bucks more
i took my truck to a couple of shops and they could not find anything wrong so they cleaned it up and told me to keep an eye on my fluid levels and whether more power steering fluid was coming out of the system
he had a very unprofessional demeanor as well
i told him i did not want to pay for any extras then he proceeded to explain how valuable the service would be if i had a blow outblah blah blah then proceeded to bargain with me by reducing the cost of the extra service
windows were nasty
thank you jeff
they always do a good job here
thank you both from the bottom of my heart
youre the best
the service is always super
then he discounted the cost or painting the parts on the estimate to meet my insurance companys rate without my asking
ive been looking for great mechanic for years
i walked out pretty contented with my thai food craving
he did not ask for anything in return and told me to return if anything else happens to the car
sears had installed a new battery in late october which then proceeded to go dead every time my jeep wasnt driven every day
with a base price around 2000 less than their competition we quickly made an appointment
ricardo was honest down to earth not going to take your money
i only wish that we could give gerber collision  glass more than 5 stars
i have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing
run through the gauntlet of voter registrars
the service was awesome and i would recommend carolina volkswagen to anyone seeking a no pressure car buying experience
so nice and respectful
first the flex pipe for my 1999 nissan sentra was broken and they fixed it in a couple of days for just 120
so here i am warning you about it
it was by far the best experience i have ever had buying a new car or truck
so after all of that i sit there for another 30 minutes while no one at all is working at my car at this point its just sitting there to have doug come out and tell me that with  that check engine light he googled it and it could be a number of things
thank god i was able to get my vacuum back although the entire cord assembly was completely gone off my vacuum
now after as summer started and because of suns heat glue melted and handle broke again
horrible customer service
they also really tried hard to get me to agree to have them do the work by offering me 100 discount for the diagnostics fee
best in the areawork and customer service speaks for itself
an employee said he had no idea he just works here and isnt very good with carsnever really did any of this
so if you want to build a lasting relationship go see deneen
i went back to the counter where i originally signed in and i was ignored at first because three employees were busy talking to each other about the deals they just did
all in all this shell is convenient clean and safe
my old protege prolly needs a timing belt soon  although ive moved to downtown phoenix ill make the trip to accurate id never take my car anywhere else for more involved maintenance or major repairs
then my dad called furious that they did this to his daughter only to get screamed at by jay the gm
showed up on time and did a great job
pay for it with your gas then use the code from your receipt for the carwash
this place has everything thing related
thankfully i never agree to anything until ive readreviewedcritically analyzed it
1970 dodge charger rt 440 magnum this car was also featured in the movie gone in 60 seconds
they reassured me that they were just moving locations
i have been taking my car here for years
are you kidding me
way better than the 5 other shops i got prices from
i will be coming back when its time thanks valle verde team
give a person a price and stick to it
my engine light came on about 2 blocks from their shop
i had a problem the first time i brought my truck in but after vince found out about my issue he contacted me
great service free vacuum
there are also great coupons in your local mailer
i couldnt be happier with the excellent customer service i received
the shop is nice they were prompt and called me when ready
after agreeing on the type of vehicle and the price i was willing to pay chris told me and my wife that he wanted to make this the best car buying experience of our lives
we showed up and the guys were in the middle of removing a transmission from another vehicle and werent sure if they could get a look at it before lunch
you get the impression theyre not going to screw you over and if you dont know much about cars i dont thats really all you can hope for right
you may have to leave your ride with ken for a day or two but hell find it
pricing is fair with bonus coupons available on their website
this place was great
so i called him 2 days later then he was out of town for the next week
he then gave me a order slip and i pulled my car up a few feet to the vacuums put it in park and stepped out of my car and went inside to the register to pay
keith returned letting her know that fixing her brakes wasnt necessary as she had 50 of her brakes left
we have a campervan company here in san francisco and these guys have helped us  out several times now with minor problems all the way up to  major issues
i made an appointment on a saturday  they were ready for me as soon as i got there
they dont have suction that can get between the seats and most of them come apart while using them
right when i returned morris kept his word and my car was shortly brought into the garage
this review is primarily of the service department but the sales was also only soso
in the end we purchased the lexus for what we wanted to pay for it and they gave us what we had hoped for for ours
honestly i didnt want to pay that much for another car but i thought we could negotiate a better price
clean 3 cars in a day make 100
as a former car rental employee their job is to upsell you into a diff class car for anywhere from 5 to 30 more
audio express did the install and i was happy
getting burned once is enough for me
they want to sell tire instead of repairing it
good stuff thank you guys
cheaper than the 7eleven across the street cheaper than rebel with your station boarding pass
after i selected the correct transaction i asked her if she had stamped my club car wash card she sighed and shoved the card across the counter to me as she rolled her eyes
when you go to dennys you have the choice of 3 services
he futher stated it carried over between locations and bestbuy online
i took it to another mechanic and asked him to replace the bulb which he did solving the problem
after another 45 minutes i called and they said it would be within the next 30 minutes
they were comfortable and quick  a massive upgrade from the bixi bicycles which are great for getting around but i wouldnt recommend doing the entire lachine canal on one
the one that is part of the chapman business
the guy found a hole on the outdrive nozzel the size of a grapefruit
because mechanics have way more knowledge about cars than your average joe they can easily make you feel dumb
so i wasted about 90 miniutes of my day and left with a dirty truck
i would vehemently dissuade any of my friends or family from using penske collision for their auto body needs
i got there and suddenly the vehicle wasnt available
i was shocked to see that the entire bill was less than i expected to pay for the tow alone
where the boys are man store
this is what the manager told me where my pgw glass came from
no matter what state i have lived in every discount tire has delivered amazing customer service
the guys were able to give a great deal on a vehicle for my mother
the woman on the phone was kind and personable but was only able to arrange an appointment a week in advance
the young man at the desk greeted me and replaced my battery in minutes
when i attempt to telephone and speak with the manager terry haisten all i get is hes not here or hes in a meeting
the difference is night and day
when i walked in the second time i was not even acknowledged and i finally sat down to wait
he even did little things he didnt have to do just to be nice
one stop shop for anything with your truck or jeep
a ghost truck
tips are for those who go above and beyond not for those who do a quick pass with a rag after taking my car through a machine
i have been back ever since
everything on my sandwich tasted really fresh the pesto on there was excellent
so takes about 70 minutes longer than a drive through oil change even when you book appointment costs more they perform none of the checks they said they did
like i said i have bought 4 cars from toyota so i am very familiar with how they normally are at other dealers
he knowledge of my vehicle was very thorough
took my tires to get them shaped they did a great job will come back again
so after the oil was changed we drove around to the other side of the building and dropped of my car for a wash  there was an entirely different waiting area there that was attached to their convenience store
my truck was a mess with bug and road grime and the crew at auto bell did a fantastic job
he ordered them and had them delivered and placed on my car all today
we had an excellent experience with freemans car stereo
i wait for my car to roll out
i do recommend to always make reservations at least 1 week in advanced
i am very impressed with the customer service at this location
he got our bumper put back on the same day at a great price
paid for the service asked a question if the wash would clean off all the bugs on the vehicle from a camping trip
gave us a verbal estimate which we authorized
1015 more expensive than other gas stations in the neighborhood
worth the drive off the main strip
in contrast our experience with another hyundai dealership in toronto was the complete opposite friendly welcoming and comfortable
my review is for planet hyundais service department as ive not purchased a hyundai from them yet
after that ordeal
i needed a last minute oil change  thank god for mark
the guys mentioned it was no problem and even held the unit until i got back a specific build that is rarely in stock in az go figure i pick something special
for dessert we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice
i did a yelp search and found that mcfalls was nearby and open on a sunday
literally thats all they did
told me it is the customers responsibility to roll up the windows
i said we would be in that afternoon
so i thought it was a bit pricey but this may be average for the area not sure
the price was extremely reasonable and people were friendly and very helpful
i purchased the air filter 30 min later i was done and on my way
decided to give them a call angie let me know they could get me in immediately which was fantastic
my regular mechanic told me he was not doing side jobs any longer so i was concerned to say the least as to where to go for some much needed brake work on my honda accord
when i went to walmart a few months later the same item was regularly priced at 95
so thankful i married a mechanic
my truck is serviced by american made only
he tried to spin it to make it sound like a good thing oh well you can take it and put it in any car you own in the futureno idiotmy car will always have xm radio installed because i wont buy a car without it
we enjoyed dealing with himhe was very eager to help us and not pushy at all
this shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs
kevin was very nice customer service on service side was unpleasant
also whats with the woman as your profile picture carmax
i highly recommend this safelite facility to take care of business
really disappointed with this place
they also made you feel like they had your best interests in mind
i called monro early this morning to see if i could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest
i cannot say enough great things about them
that is true customer service as many places wouldnt have done that but randy did
whether that was done with bad intentions thinking i may miss it or again incompetence i dont know
came in during nonbusy time and got a bit of a discount
they command their employees around like they are their little slaves
the laws are set in a way that protects the dealer ship and offers nothing to the buyer
if you are in need of some help go see them
youve got to be kidding me
i do recommend calling and making an appointment because as you can imagine they are busy
you know there are some coupon cost 10  15 only
i drove all the way to the other side of town to look at a specific car that i had been emailing one of the sales people about and made an appointment to look at the car and test drive it at 6pm last night
sam replaced it
will definitely be coming back
thank you guys
obviously sct does not give this to the auto buyerits worked into the price you pay for the cartruck
this was my first car buying experience and cameron walked me through the process step by step
went to this dealership to look at jeep wranglers as we were in the market for one
after speaking with antonio he listened to my concerns and stated that he would talk to the general manager mr kevin bushey to see what they can do
the hose was on backorder for at least a week so they crafted a custom one to save us money and time
i will buy every bike here and wholeheartedly recommend this dealership to everyone
i got the ultimate car wash and used a 30 off coupon  it ended up being just under twenty dollars
the services performed were overpriced and we will never go back
you lost a sale and a customer that was loyal up until that point
he didnt have to but he did
the owner ended up helping me since i had to wait for more than 30 seconds bonus points for immediate customer service and the owner obviously caring about his business
i ended up just taking it to my dealership and i told them what they said and they laughed
no thanks ill do it myself
they sell em
after about an hour niki called to informed me that after contacting other locations she could only get 2 out of 4 tires the size i needed had been discounted everywhere by the manufacturer  michelin
i asked if he would like to give me the spelling and he walked away stating that i should get a dictionary
friendly auto has done a great job keeping my fleet on the road
nice guys great work fair price
i made an appointment for an hour later
wash bay was a bit tight as i have a full size pickup
this makes it easier on the owner of the vehicle and less wear and tear on the seal of the tire and rim alike
they told us the car had to be there at 8am this morning
they will deal with you as i am done doing so
okay i want to start with the good things
but he seems genuinely positive and we continued
we got a great deal and got a nicer than what i thought i was going to get
they were reasonably busy for a tuesday and had a lot of repeat customers
the finance manager then proceeded to tell us that the altima loan had been approved with me and my fiance on itim sorry we never authorized you to put our names on that altima loan only the jeep loan
he was so nervous about lying he started taking pictures of a scratch on my fender that happened years ago
the main issue that we experiencedas did many many many of the other sellers that we spoke to was a real lack of qualified buyers in the auction
i bought my very first nissan at this dealership
my g37 was paid off no accidents low mileage44000 and was in great condition
i cant wait to visit  the shop and ill definitely go to lusty wrench any time i need a mechanic
they are all just so nice helpful and considerate
2 days at village auto electric did the trick
avoid this place at all costs
this place is where you wanna be
the highlight for me was the thai dishes i had never seen before
no answer so i decided to just make an appointment the following day
when she asked for the information about the date the repairs were initially completed we didnt have them on hand of course because we are stranded
this place is the best
could not have been happier
a salesman named jay helped us and i told him that i was not there to buy i was only there to see what cars i fit in
im shocked at how this business handles customer complaints and especially yelp reviews
made an appointment to come and look at a vehicle at 6pm
so we scheduled for august 4th
today i went to get in the vehicle after being called that they were finished cleaning
i work literally around the block so i called in to just talk and explain my situation and needs
prices were about the same
i bought my motorcycle there over a year ago
anyway i made it clear that it was running perfectly when i brought it in and it needs to act the same when i pick it up
i went in to have it fixed and had to fight with the dealership on getting a rental covered
we met with the team and went through what we would like to have done on the vehicle
nobody wants to have to take their car to the body shop but taking it to rob wagner is a pleasure
certainly a top notch operation in all areas i would highly recommend george and his partners body shop
did not get the wax off in several places missed spots overall bad job
and it was exceptional
my car seems to be doing great and i definitely recommend johnson automotive to anyone
yea i know i should have had a spare friend recommended blaze so thought id call
also entry and exit for the customers would improve substantially if they were to open up a path from commerce st craig rd is always busy so maneuvering a big truck through steady flowing traffic that hardly eases up is a bit stressful
i live pretty far from gilbert so i explained that i was going to go to breakfast then i would wait until the tinting job was done because i did not want to drive all the way home and back to gilbert
three when i asked them to provide me with the bank that was approving the loan because i did not accept the loan they lied to me and told me it was approved by a different bank and not the one that actually approved it
update  even though i dislike this dealership i saw a car that really interested me in their website
i almost question their skills and incompetence
thumbs up to these companies
the weekend goes by and monday comes and no word yet
he presented me with a couple of important low priced warranties
halfway during my experiences with master engine rebuilding i found that they had 2 listings on yelp and the other listing did not have rave reviews
i ran into a customer of mine today that said they did the same thing to his neighbor
after 3 trips and 2500 dollars later has left me in the poor housei guess its my fault for going back but never again
being older and wiser now personally i would not go back to audio express
the manager bill was very helpful
there are still some minor issues that i had noticed after leaving the shop that he has stated he can and will take care of upon my return
tues they started on it got truck at dusk
i talked to a manager the most condescending human being on the planet and told him my situation
i bought my car in cali from a dealership that i actually loved
the estimate was 13 the amount i was quoted just a few hours earlier at shitboys
he offers me six free oil change coupons for the inconvenience and states that it doesnt normally take this long
there were a lot of accessories for sale but it was disappointing that there were not many things available that had both las vegas and harley davidson together on them
my tire light was was on and they stated the light was broken and  it needed to be replaced at a cost  of 600
im never without my vehicle for more than a day and i appreciate the free shuttle
paul please take a class on how to treat your customers or youll be a used car salesman your whole life
it cost us 140 to complete the recalls
he will tell you things he notices about your car that could use attention but he doesnt do it in a way that makes you feel like you must buy now like jiffy lube does
i will always deal with berge when it come to any service needs on my ford explorer
gregg didnt perform any services for me but he did help me understand the cost of replacing a clutch in my 2008 honda civic si
needless to say my experience with this dealership and toyota including all the recalls on this car which is a whole other story have been less than glamorous
i came in and had my 4runner tinged with the ceramic tint and they were extremely helpful in helping me decide what grade of tint i wanted and explained the benefits of it
they did a great thorough job too
hopefully you will be as please with their service conduct honestly pricing and integrity as we are
i test drove a honda element which was clean and comfortable to drive but the brakes on this one needed work  very slow response to stop
her reply this is not an option but you could have purchased over the phone this am
they were able to replace the bolts right then
the service was outstanding they take care of their customers and they have gained a life long customer in me
i stopped here with a nail in my tire they where going to fix it for free seeing i had bought 4 truck tires here back in 2006 that was impressive but my car was my issue
need gas late at night
the car would start up but was quitting after going over bumps
mark is so nice and i have paid the kindness forward already
paid 5 and they even scraped off the sticker glue from an ad someone left on my car
my concerns 1 material contract changes to the purchase price and extended warranty to pocket the difference between the quoted and final loan interest rate
leave here knowing youre getting an honest deal
unlike certain nationwide chains of transmission shops that will tell you that the transmission needs to be replaced allied did a full inspection and only found it to be a minor problem to fix
once the insurance company decided to stop being lazy and actually do their job fernando and his team had my toyota back in perfect condition
do not bring your business to them
again this is me best memory of arizona ever
it will seat 6 for all our guests coming to town
on top of that they ripped off my sun visor that was somewhat already broken
a friend and long time champaign resident recommended this place when i mentioned my deflating tire
they had me pull into the booth with no lift checked the tires added about 5 lb to each tire and sent me on my merry way
i was called 2 or 3 times to try to reschedule my appointment for their convenience
jim drove me to a restaurant that was 10 minutes away
2 for 2 at a carwash omg
they also got me ready for running 37s with a pinch weld mod
congrats you lost a paying customer
after waiting an hour and a half for the free oil change on a 2015 honda fit i was told that offer no longer existed and was charged almost 60 for the oil change
i brought my f350 73l diesel that i had recently purchased to dahn automotive for weston to diagnose a nonfunctioning bd exhaust brake
i should have checked these reviews first anyway i purchased a groupon 60 bucks for 119 worth of service
patient to a fault even with a borderline retarded landlubber like me
their finance department is super easy to understand and the facility is just beautiful
only took a couple of hours for my car to get tinted
honestly i never knew that getting my oil changed could be such a pleasant experience
no because i dont know what it was like before but i do know is wasnt dangling like that when i brought it in but what i can complain about is the dirt that was all over the back side of his car and still in spots along the side maybe the dirt just really wanted to stay with the car but it did wipe right off later that day when i pulled in his driveway and took a towel to it because i wanted it to look nice
i took my friends car in for her and when she got it back she had a nonworking air conditioner which worked perfectly before i took it in for her to get her battery
this company will take great care of you as their customer
yep they got her in and got her on the road again with a temporary repair
ive been to this location many times and have always been pleased
he arrived on time and was done within 2 hours
i told them at the very beginning to not waste my time and if they cant do it or dont have a truck for about 810k then wed leave
super clean grounds best gas prices ive ever seen in the east valley and plenty of stalls to accommodate the flood of drivers who already understand this with room for more lol
needlessto say the chemical all team auto provided me with did not get the job done however it slightly softened the clog however it was nowhere near strong enough to penetrate the clog
we negotiated a deal on the car we drove and he sent me the deal in writing via email on sunday
a week later turns out my car had apparent leaks and now will be fixing it
they have never charged myself or anyone i have referred to them to diagnose there vehicles problem
the guy at big o told me that i hit something
the price of the scooter tour is the same as bicycle tours in the city so why not save some energy on peddling
i didnt know what to expect with my oil change and he explained the entire process to me
it has the tiny crushed ice that i absolutely love
the customer service at this location is lacking greatly
had the car towed home and found they didnt even look under the battery or at the cables since the terminals were eroded
lunch was amazing the kraphao moo krob and spicy fried beef rice has inspired me to try and recreate it in my own kitchen
i wish they had better air fresheners the ones in the cans that you put under the seat are great they just have really weak ones
the store itself is clean and always has a great variety of products
being a chick coming to an auto body shop can be frustrating
kira who runs the front desk is the friendliest and most professional person whos ever greeted me with a smile
first their pricing is a little more than other locations and is not as clear ie
anyway i was on for another 20 min myself despite prebooking and had to wait 20 minutes to be checked out
they were super nice and totally understanding
my return to phx went well also
i chose to go here after reading reviews on yelp and am sure glad i did
whatever beside the point
i called them as soon as i left the place but of course they are closed saturdays which their service employee didnt bother telling me
and robert goes on to say that if it takes too long for my warranty company to pick up the phone and he has a customer in front of him he would take care of that customer first and hang up on the warranty company if hes holding
so far not good
the guy that worked there was pretty cool and fixed all the little problems with my older car but didnt charge me an arm and a leg
the job was done right and when it came to pay i got a repeat customer discount
i recommend chris ross the car dealer and johnathan isfahani the finance manager  and tell them i savannah c walters referred them to you
then erika came to the rescue friendly knowledgeable and able
the price will go up upsell because the standard is 10k a year
and now its 2850000 do i look like a moron
there is almost never anyone there
hes always been great to work with and does a great job with the repairs and is always more than fair with the price
outgoing and knowledgeable
excellent place to get a bit to eat
prices for service
after working my up the chains i was offered a 50 discount on the paint repairs
if and when itll be at liberty
with that the review grade goes down then
i wont buy their tires
don was really friendly helpful and knowledgable
the bill was 13 of what i would have been charged at a jiffy lube plus they repaired a check engine light problem for free
one day my car works fine the next it wont even turn on or unlock with the alarm remote
there were a lot of little things i noticed that were not as clean as i wanted them to be for the 40 diamond package
say no more
goldies had a car i wanted but i lived pretty far away so i called them up and micah was quick to answer the questions i had on the vehicle
so many tire shops will automatically tell you that it is not repairable even if it is  just so they can sell you a new tire
i would never recommend someone do business here
the only thing about this place is that there are bystanders at the entrance looking for jobs but just ignore them
thank me later
i was at the dealer for about 30 minutes and hassle free
andrew and his team at ozbraz did an amazing job on my bmw m3 with suntek clearbra
thank you again brian for everything
mark and david recently replaced my brake pads and rotors all the way around my car
do not buy an extended warranty with these people
they were all great to work with
car wash and auto detail
i have a long list to go thru
like i said before just say no
i am usually a diy mechanic but these 2 things would have required more time than i had available since i do work full time
the only reason i havent decided to switch cars is that i know chris will watch out for me and help me take care of this car
i bring my vehicle here every year for a smog check going on 4 years now
all i need is to get pricing on services they do to be exact its an synthetic oil change
he then takes off and i am left sitting there watching him spew black smoke all the way down the road going as fast as he can
i went there and they lost my remote control off my keychain
it took about 25 minutes for all of this
they gave me an estimated time of 225 hours to tint the whole cars
my wife and i love our bikes see pics
oh wait that would be intelligent
when i left i said i paid for the air freshener and the employee stated oh yeah i forgot
the review pattern is interesting
theyll treat you well
so if you have the cash and want to pay cash you can but you cant get the sale price
they asked if i could bring my car in the very next morning and i did so
i do own dogs and knew is was from there but to pay 200 to have your car detailed and to have them forget to even clean the windows is totally unacceptable
taj apologized and gave me the facts on what to do next time
avoid this place at all costs
the crew at discount tires is second to none
quick service and very professional
i buy my milk at the grocery store so i didnt have any problems i guess
my car had several minor scratches and a few very deep ones
i took my car in from a very routine check  and thank goodness i did
everything about the experience from the scheduling to the service itself to the reconciling of the error to the customer service follow up was an abysmal failure
all the body panels were replaced with custom parts we had ordered from a company in taiwan
looking for a truck bed cover
if its such an issue to order a 9 part i cant imagine buying a 30k car
one additional note at chapman chevrolet in tempe my cars always came back spotless clean
then they give pictures of the things that need to be fixed in the future
then later told me it was never apart of the agreement
still though these folks are accommodating and great
so i ended up searching for another place and was specifically looking for a place that was open on sunday
honest and reliable
he answered all my questions gave me competitive pricing and got sample books sent out to my address
everyone that i had dealt with there were absolutely wonderful
in short i went in for an alignment and drove away with multiple repairs of other shops mistakes for the same price
i expect to return to this shop with more work shortly
if what they offer doesnt suit you walk away andor get your financing elsewhere and they will most likely follow youagain with a better deal
its so hard to choose just a few dishes because everything sounds great so either come with a large group of people or get ready to come back
it was 715 and i hadnt heard anything so i called
so i called the main office in irvine and told me to leave the car in the parking lot and leave the keys in a box they have at the lobby
soaking up the som tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious
do yourself a favor if you need body work done go straight to red mountain collision
so now were on the 5th call and you inform the rep that you need them to assist you and youre just looking for an update
i highly highly recommend brian at future service
it worked and now the car os up and runming
the owner did agree to remove the 14 charge for the insurance as he should have but refused to refund the 25 cleaning fee
i called the dealership where i bought the vehicle and they only charge 41
minced sour sausage mixed with green onion fresh chili ginger peanuts crispy rice and lime juice
sun auto refused to accept my money
i would suggest to have a ride to take you to and from though unless you dont mind waiting for awhile but thats for any type of service you go for
just recently traded my car in for an audi and had a great experience here
i found this place via a groupon and have since taken our car back for service and inspections
they quoted me 30 on the phone but charged me 40 when i was there but i didnt question it
at hour 2 i asked for my car back and they said they could not give it back at this point but it still had not been serviced
i will say that though i felt my old car was in great shape first and only owner no accidents within 10 yr 100000 miles warranty i only was given 3 grand
the gave brats on special
i used enterprise in chicago for the first time about a year ago and the service was excellent and the price reasonable great considering the service
chris gave us a ride to the mall while we waited for him to work his magic which was a nice gesture
they used a bunch of fresh herbs and it came with green mini eggplants and peppers
i am very happy with how all my cars have turned out
jason and his crew are very straight forward about your options what itll cost you and what their suggestions are
on the day of our visit a saturday afternoon there were plenty of people wandering around
anyways i hope you dont need a tow truck but if you do give these guys a shot they treated me well and were priced reasonable
the worst service ever
she then tells me if i want them to check to see if there is something wrong with the front brakes it will cost an additional 5000  i am too livid to think straight at this point and tell her to forget it since i will be charged an extra 50 in order to have them do what i brought the car there for in the first place
for some of you that might be a scary proposition but for a a clever deal maker like myself this was everything i could ever wish for
by 730 when we left there were tons of people waiting
he made sure the car was detailed and spotless when we drove it off the lot
i usually prefer to have the inspections done
they were super friendly and didnt try to up sale me on other supplies
the vehicle was in the bay within minutes after signing in
i have driven by many times but did not realize that the cars are washed by hand
and of course the other patrons who blast good jams while you vacuum
i never ever had a gas station attendant try to sell me liquior
shes very calming
the views were incredible the fresh hot bagels wonderful and the fresh fruit from the marketperfect
i am very happy with quality of work
he tells us that the car will be done in an hour
when i thanked him profusely for the immense help he said something that i havent heard in a long timei believe in repeat customers thats where its at
its a bit disturbing when you show up to the register and the employee behind it is so bored out of their mind that they are on their phone while the other is staring out the windows
i have never been more pleased with the price the work and the knowledge of the staff
it could affect how fastsmoothly the air conditioningheat flows but if i havent been experiencing any issues there or strange smells the cars performance is not negatively affected if i dont replace it now the cabin filter would be 75 to replace he did however say the engine filter should be replaced as it directly affects performance and ill get better gas mileage if its replaced this filter cost 25
technician james came out to give me a quote on replacing dual windshields on a 1997 dolphin motor home
he is very honest and is always looking for ways to save you money
i see that my experience mirrors many of the other reviews here on yelp
also trust somebody you know
the reason i am writing this is because of the repeated unhappy service i have gotten there and from getting the phone hung up on me when i call in
i made an appointment
definitely recommend it
i did have some questions about a paint sprayer once and the fella i talked to was quite helpful  they didnt have what i was looking for but he knew where i could find the stuff
they are easy to deal with and they have a great service department
on my first visit i wanted to wait for the work to be done and they even drove me to the nearest dennys so i could get breakfast
i was called to come pick up my car and as i was halfway there walking i got another call from them saying one of my front ball joints was bad and that they recommend i replace it and to not drive on it longer than 12 weeks
but we couldnt take the car home because it was still being touched up
i asked the service manager mike to please simply reset my automatic windows because with a battery change those features are affected
but i always have a problem when im checking out
kind of like saying my plane ticket is free but all i have to do is pay for the jet fuel before i can get off the plane
my previous review was flagged for some reason but i believe consumers should be aware of the lack of professionalism i encountered and lack of return phone calls that went ignored after the mishaps
after picking the car up our son called and said the brakes felt weird
i started asking around and a few of my friends had tried method glass and said they had received a really great price and great customer service
literally the best customer service i have ever experienced
i got my first smart phone somewhere else and needed ear buds and  phone case
526pm on a weekday and i drop their rental off
thank you findlay toyota for a flawless car buying experience
nam kao tod crispy rice salad is a great starter
called them the next day to discuss the deficiency
she handed me off to another salesperson nick as she was busy with a customer
we were frustrated and angry at how we had been treated
the work was passable at best
i stopped by this dealership and the initial experience was disappointing to say the least
i then told he is a liar and a thief
i waited two days where i have driven 300 miles to write a review but things are working perfectly
thank you all for making an exciting endeavor even more enjoyable
everything took about 30 minutes which is much faster than big box car shops on the other side of town
i purchased a 2007 chevy impala which was probably the best car i could find on the lot
let me tell you this employee his name was chance put on a big heavy coat went into the huge freezer i could see him spider monkey jump to the next shelf it was quiet for a few moments and the boom here comes chance with a box of edamame to save the day
then went as far as to tell me i wasnt yet approved and i should just take the van home anyways
so i said whatever grabbed my umbrella and started to walk around the shadyside area
all good i likey
got there at 11am and they quoted my wait time at being around an hour
friendly service guys also
the guy also threw in an oil change for 20 extra
thank you yelp
that everything was complete
they also put in a tire rotation while they were at it
phone numbers out of service now
strong integrity and work ethic
they also havent responded to any voicemails and are never in the office
initially they were pleasant
for something that most people dread my car buying experience was made very pleasant by joe
when the drive is finished i will simply exchange the device for my license
this would have been fine if they had a loaner car for me to use as i had to work for the next three days but unfortunately all of their loaner cars were unavailablein use
tables are filled quickly
i have since opened up an account with one of their competitors woodies auto service in hopes that they will have much better customer service
since this was my first time i passed on everything
they then asked us to wait an additional 45min for a quick detail
the customer service pricing and attention to detail has always been perfect
thats less than what you offered him the first time
drew is a great guy but my mechanic did not give me good service
i use 808 automotive for all the work on my car and really believe jesse gives me honest service
we used this marina for a few years but the service level and overall quality has really gone downhill
beware of this company
i have no conflict of interest
he is a person that will take the time to discuss what repairs are needed and doing what necessary within his power to help his clients
it most certainly did not need to be replaced
between the company and jerrys i am now in a 2016 model that was far less expensive than the new 2014 2015 and 2016 models found on line
inexpensive fast good work
when i returned home i opened my glovebox to get my paperwork out so i could call nissan i found a sales receipt from the car being sold on 29 for three thousand more than i paid
will not be using this dealer again
funny i was going to replace the 2002 truck this year  toyota 4runner here i come
anywaysmy brakes sound horrible and i knew id have to get them looked and most likely new ones
in any case back to the good because he knows that you are going the extra mile to powder coat rather than paint juan actually respects that fact and always makes sure to do a stupendous job
weve used the detailing service a couple of times and have been satisfied
and if its that time of the year for you theres a smog testing station off to the side
scotty was super helpful over the phone
these days bad service and insulting customers can cost you more than just one sale
i still really really wanted to test drive the car so i figured id drop into a dealership to try one out
the service adviser was detailed and clear
one star for you sir
that was my 1st and last time going there
after reviewing my deal a couple days later i see that i owe 26k on the note after trading in a car with 4k equity so i paid 30k for a 2016 dodge caravan
must try club sandwich with boars head quality gourmet meat
i would give him 5 on diagnosis and knowledge and a 3 customer service
its crazy to say i have brand loyalty for gas stations but this place is so convenient and they always have everything im looking for
chocolate chip cookies
i had the khao soi which was so hearty and flavorful
the manager gives me a free wash but only after i asked for some form of compensation
i rebuked that it would cost me 400 to replace the key
and just like every other interaction ive had with this location they went above and beyond
he told me that by driving my vehicle i must have reset the sensors and since the check engine light was off it would be a great time to go get a smog test
everyone i know now goes here and you should too
this is the part where i give the dealership two stars for this
ive been coming here for years now and highly recommend them to everyone       car repairs can be a bich but bring it on in to see mitch
but for nowi wont be back
i literally laughed at him thinking he was out of a dang mind
he told me as much as he would want to fix my jeep i would be better off not putting a penny more into repairing and just do a tradein for a new car
the technician brandon arrived in less than 2 hours after i first had the thought
i have been coming here for over a year
brians boss was almost more obnoxious than brian
the guy ripped the offer out of my husbands hands and said rudely  happy hunting
after an hour i called several times no answer
i had the misfortune of dealing with a young woman with an accent when i dropped the car off
no fighting or arguing just fixed and returned
after i left i opened the armrest to get something i keep there and it was a disaster
most of their reviews are actually 5 stars
when i wanted to see the final estimate the owner himself spent 15 minutes showing me my poor torndown car and explaining every piece of the estimate
great service but get that crew a credit card machine
would highly recommend this place to anyone that needs general car repairs done
vehicle did not enter the device area until 140pm
so unless your stuff is some sort of super fuel that last twice the distance drop the tude
i only have myself to blame for being dumb enough to go back there twice to have the service department do the exact  thing twice
they were even nice enough to discount the new wheel and installation because they didnt have the match in their inventory
also they have not credited out deposit back
the brand its suck
and to think i almost let these guys touch my focals fk that
i would recommend them for all of your auto body needs
few sold and those that did sold for about half their value
which was fine
he referred me to another dealer in avondale rodeo kia
i tell all my friends to take their cars to this locations
the same day i got my 2nd car wash and mario sold me on a full car service with detail cleaning which i would have never done and just felt generous and did it
there is a place to get coffee or smoothie right on the premises and the man behind the counter was nice and put on the misters while we waited for the car
my insurance company said nevada is a noninspection state and a glass company can make you do unnecessary claims without accountability
the team at recon is a great resource and im glad i gave it a shot
be sure to stop by mighty auto pro today or call to reserve your appointment
even if they are only doing an oil change they are inspecting other parts of my vehicle and will let me know if anything seems off
yes i paid double the mvds fee but im sure i saved a lot of time
they allowed me to create appointments that worked with my schedule they offered coffee and a bag for my things small but makes a difference and explained each step before theyit happened
very nice company we drove over a screw with out vehicle and it was stuck in the tire we read the reviews on yelp and rushed there minutes before closing they happily fixed our tire for free  and within a half hour we were in and out
we also remembered oil change last tuesday and they did a battery check
im happy to take my business to another audi dealership who will put together a better deal and isnt so arrogant
and i said why would you even show that to me i have my own financing
worst customer service ever
she tried to find out the one question that was the most important to me
bela is passionate about providing his customers the best solutions and working with their budgets
would definitely recommend stopping here during your car shopping process and ask for mark
polite customer service
everything very clean and put away and it is in a great location
the process was painless and dare i say enjoyable as iris has a great attitude and honest approach
we like it and they have one fresh off the transport
hell even costco carwash tells you to
maybe its because its so hot but im again annoyed and tell him i gave them all this information when i booked my appointment
mark was very friendly and honest needed a new battery and i thought i needed an oil change but they checked the oil and said that it was good and i didnt need one
the shop should have admitted it and fixed it but they didnt so i have my car back and i have a nice scratch on the hatchback door as a souvenir from the body shop
the gentleman who helped me pablo i think was his name was very helpful and i tipped him after
and their customer service is out of this world
as an executive elite member i was horribly disappointed with the customer service i received at the lv airport location
so i take time off work to come pick up at 8am and they werent there
isabella was terrific
thank you to dj quick malcom and stretch
even after i pointed out that ive had this same bulb replaced by autozone including this store previously with no problems
it now looks great no thanks to dunrite
on calling green cab again they say it was a mistake and my driver was still 510 minutes away
well it doesnt stop there
lotus of siam is tucked away in a sketchy area but the restaurant was just renovated and its actually nice inside not fancy but nicer than the standard hole in the wall asian restaurants
i want to look at the vehicle tonight and why look at the sticker price i was shocked at what they decided to add as additional expenses
its for business needs
we were satisfied at the price and we did the deal
being worried i checked the manual and it said to top it up and it may have a leak so take it in for service
shady organization to say the least
i dont usually give reviews but if any yelpers ever need to have their car worked on by an honest shop with an honest manager go see  brandon  my folks have an older german car 380 sl and we discovered our brake light came on
ill be stopping there on my travels
returning from my road trip i took the findings of the dealer to include the evidence of the faulty repair and parts back to this business and asked for resolution
service    in the final months of my saturn lease findlay chevrolet was the authorized dealership performing saturn service
i did not catch it until after leaving but that was my fault
i have gone to the website 4 times now trying to buy  weekend general admission tickets 12500 for the 4th time and it does not allow it
i got food poisoning from here but the food was so good ill still give it 2 stars
he answered the phone promptly and helped me understand more about the entire process and what kind of film would be best for my needs
the folks behind the counter were really friendly  much appreciated on a hot day when i was thirsty and brainfried
i came through the express wash lane
then youll have to wipe down the inside dash yourself
if you are in las vegas and need tire work or tiresyou cannot beat these guys
just this morning i had to get a service and didnt have an appointment
i stopped and turned it off
she delivers on all her quotes and timelines and knows how to get things done
they seem to have the oldschool sleazy used car sales mentality and dont seem to value educated newcar customers harder to upsell
i went ahead and leased for another 3 years and when i turned in my old lexus i had no problems
i test drove it took it for a car wash and it looked amazing
at this point she also said dont worry about the warrantythe important thing is your car is doneand well work this out
the next day i noticed an even larger puddle under my car and could see an area where liquid was still leaking
thank you subaru of las vegas keep up the good work
not like some of the nasty arcos and circle ks
there seems to a drastic shortage of car washes in the toronto areabut this is one
normal dealership greediness
these guys will sell you a subaru
you can tell this is the goto auto repair place within the community with the amount of calls they receive
was available to arrive within 2 hours of my initial call
i have been a customer since 2009 because theyre honest reliable and affordable
i brought this to the guys attention who started to try and clean the tar off
we went to kia sands where we were promptly greeted by a sales person and we told him what we were looking for took a couple of test drives and got down to business
tell me they have to claybar it and add some other stuff
the quote just for the rear was 380
thank you joey and all your help
they lower the truck and he says if you want it louder we can remove the rear resonator
did i mention 113 degree heat
car gets taken to henderson 90 miles away and the service manager shane said there is no issue
he simply said thats fine
i would never take my car anywhere else and recommend cary to everyone i know
i have both cars detailed more than once
a lot of employees walking around doing nothing
we will come back to get my wife one as well
when i came to the auto place they worked on a simple oil change and showed me all the problems with my car
great place to take your car
i was so relieved when he fixed my front door locks he did an amazing job fast and efficient
i have been here few times now and every time i come here they find something new which needs to be replaced
i told them i would leave the car but they would have to provide me a loaner which they did
it told them not to check the tpms too much
i wouldnt recommend this place or this people
that should account for my credibility on why i would even take the time to write this
they just supported my decision and said to contact them if i ever changed my mind which i did 3 days later i called them to see if the offer was still good and they said yes and that they would do the prelim paperwork and it would be ready when i got there
i returned the car to big o tires that day and they kept it for more diagnostics until monday 71717 on monday they called and told me it would be another 115 dollars to recharge the freon
this was definitely one of my favorite dishes and a must order
as a single woman i feel very confident that daves is taking care of my vehicle in my best interest
friendly staff and great service
they offer full service auto cleaning
all in one day promised again 4 different delivery times still dont get it right and im still waiting and ruin my whole day plans with family that flew in for the weekend
you cant blame me for that right
went in today because my tire kept going flat
easiest and fastest smog check ive had
highly recommend and would use their services again
randys is highly recommended
he did give me a wax for half off which was nice because i needed it
amazing cant get any better then this place
they turned off the light for free
so thankful i bought a honda
heres how it went down not only did the rental place have a car waiting for me at the shop when i arrived but throughout the entire process i only dealt with tory who was accessible and polite and competent
i dont think ive ever gotten a car wash this well done for sure i will be coming back to this location from now on
unfortunately i was sadly underwhelmed
give your car a bath and reap the benefits of some jealousy from the dirty cars
omer the ownershop manager checked it out
walked in and was immediately greeted
i would definitely recommend this place for tinting and alarm systems
he delivered services at a very competitive price about 300 less than the next best offer and as promised
first words said to me from some bald gentleman in a black shirt is we close in 20 minutes so we wont be able to do anything for you today youll have to come back tomorrow
ford country inspected the ac and said that the issue wasnt covered under warranty because the system needed a recharge
the service manager at auto nation superstition springs chevrolet said that it is out of his control and that i have to call gm customer assistance
i got into my car last saturday morning as the temperature began to drop and my low tire sensor light came on i thought oh god i must have a flat tire and i am not prepared for this to happen again
its got all the details
alonso and chris made my experience really sad
clearly costco will survive without my membership but i will never shop at costco again thanks to the pharmacists refusal to even apologize for their system having screwed up
after waiting a week to have my car repaired properly one would think i would be triaged to the top of their list
be careful when going to this place
the gas here usually isnt the cheapest but for me its the most convenient
he explained to me that almost every auto garage and dealership out there use a particular computer program to asses how many service hours any given repair takes after inputting make model part that needs replacing etc
they would rush the service for me
they should have determined we needed the engine on the first trip
but what can you do
my daughter and i were in vegas on the weekend of new years and only had a short time in vegas
well normally i wouldnt expect anything more than a governmental experience from such a place
i noticed my wifes tires were staring to wear and crack
i had to call dispatch at 1130pm to ask were the tech was
i explain this to the manager james and he tried to explain to me what all the readings meant and that the other place that did the previous alignment has old equipment and their machine is messed up and that if i dont get it realigned ill ruin my tires
and everything because they were guessing about the problemjust dont goseriously
i have tan cloth seating thats very hard to keep clean
really i just needed the basics so i got a motorcycle jacket and some gloves
we will continue to buy and service our vehicles through bell honda
i loved everything about the experience from the clean lobby to the free soda water and coffee
fortunately my salesman was alex moussa
papaya salad soft shell crab noodles drunken noodles pad thai fried prawns the soup that could have been my last meal and i wouldve been fine with that
as soon as i got in my car i noticed a 30inch crack across the windshield that wasnt there before
however the guy who did answer asked roger and there was no answer from him
i was able to take care of it easily thoughthe dashmat fit every vent and corner perfectly i mean perfecti am very pleased with the productand would recomend dash designs
on the upside i cant recommend scottsdale harley davidson enough take your money there and you will be very happy
i was on off back on around under and draped over that bike about 15 times before we left the store no exaggeration
tow my vehicle fine ill pay to have it picked up but to enter my vehicle and remove my personal belongings crosses the line from being a business to a bunch of criminals im not gonna say exactly what was stolen as there is a police report in process but it was high value i spoke with the owner of company who stated we get complaints like this all the time  yeah no crap when you employ thieves you get complaints of theft i showed him signs that someone was in vehicle and he walked away from mea real pos beware of this company and its felonious drivers they will rob you in more ways than oneshady tow drivers have nothing better to do after towing a vehicle than to go through the vehicle for some extra money to feed the rest of their trailer park family members or their meth addiction
i will definitely go back for future detailing and tint
i have all the texts and papers saved of them admitting their carelessness
josh one of the guys who works there worked with us and when we got there let us pick out whatever car we wanted
bought a 2014 corvette from colussy
i appreciate all of mrtrails help in making me make the right decision
frankly i probably wont either
while mr smooth was doing his song and dance and working hard to get the best deal doing an appraisal of the trade yatta yatta yatta all information was taken
he took the time to sit down with aaron and i to run through the numbers
they even got all the hair my little pup jeb left in the back
the line is ridiculous you would think they could move faster than this
my wifes car has been in twice and ive had a mirror replaced on mine
they werent the least bit busy that day and now i understand why
i was so impressed with thier professionalism and highly recommend my friends purchase here
which includes the interior as well
he has treated me with kindness respect and understanding
i have used safelite to repair or replace my windshield multiple times over the last 5 years
i received a coupon in the mail for 10 oil change and 10 smog
in the end my daughter is unhappy with her car payments 340 for a lease
i highly suggest everyone try them out next time you need your home or car taken care of
professional and informational
they did miss two spots that i could easily see
had a coupon
i called them based on a referral from a friend
found a car online drove up and meet with a sales rep  after a little drive and discussion on the price we were able to come to an agreement
well a couple days passed then a couple more and the problem is still cured
sammys did just that and i drove away happy
didnt try to up sell me anything which i like that a lot
he said they would have to keep my car overnight and he would call me the next day to test
the pain was easily managed with some aleve and a few drinks after i was done drivingriding the atv of course
workers even huddled up to count and disburse their tips
the employees here are very friendly and helpful
james spent close to 3 hours on my vehicle
when my husband mentioned this to the receptionist she merely said ok ill tell them
the reason why you would want every little detail done properly is because it aint cheap for a suv
i fill them out truthfully and if there was something i mention that was below my satisfaction it is always followed up by someone in the complaints section who will request more information to fully understand your complaint and work at correcting it to your satisfaction
i had to argue with the manager about this
are they perfect
from the second i called i felt like more than a costumer but part of their team
while my windshield was in need of replacement i was told that because i chose to book my appointment through the company that they superstar car wash are affiliated with i would receive a 25 gift card for future services
that following morning i had an email from adam one of the owners
we identified the issues that needed to be addressed today and the ones that could wait
auto nation nissan tempe met my needs and exceeded expectations over other dealers
too often that doesnt happen
it took them about 6 hours to finish fixing the car
returning was easy but the first agent still stuck with me
im a big fan
2 days later today i call them because i havent heard an estimate yet
they call non stop from different numbers because each time i block the number and yet somehow they keep on finding another number to call my from
the sad thing is i really want to get a new car and would have got one if every aspect of this experience did not suck
its an older car and the drain plug would not seat correctly after the oil change
gas prices seem a bit higher than a lot of other places preperks card
we have been restoring a truck for over a year and took it to them a few moths ago to get the entire inside done in white linex
i obtained my device in november 2016 and i chose this company because i was given false information that the cost was considerably less expensive than other places
i was also told that the vehicle would come with a full tank of gas and only came with a half a tank
frankly this place just confirms for me that all of guy fieris taste is in his hindquarters
the stuff are great
the owner at car connection was nice for about 2 minutes of conversation  until i expressed concerns about being charged for a repair on a car that we bought only 5 short months ago  especially a function that should have been checked before it sold
she is the best service adviser at this location
it was idling too high needed a tire replaced and it was leaking oil
it was affordable and convenient and great quality
it was tasty but there was definitely a lot more rice than meat
the second time i went was for inspection and they were very upfront about what needed done now and what wasnt necessary for inspection but needed looked at in 36 months
i wont say what spilled on my floor carpets but their vacuums can really suck
when we came in the guy was not friendly
i found the 15 wash to wash the car quite well
however he wasnt able to hear me say that because of the second phone ringing in the background  which i have to assume was his cell phone
the car received two coats of wax
terrible terrible terrible
their service fee was 14900 including tip and they told me they will call me when they have my things
however dont do anything until i call him so we can go over the contents together
had them fix a dent on a notevenamonthold 2016 honda fit coming from a trip to ca
they said that the rotors were so bad that they could not be turned
i keep coming back every time my truck needs fixing
also i get that it was the end of the day but the guys that worked there were kinda short with me and didnt really explain what the different options were
i knew it was a long shot given how last minute i was asking
i stopped in to just brakes and described the problem to gene and the guys
i got there and the guy was friendly and told me about a promotion 203h
some of the best thai food i have ever had
meanwhile my wife overheard the financing guy rhett yell at the salesman get him back out here
the driver was a nice enough guy and provided value to the unfortunate circumstance
you will be shamed
upon calling the 800 number i was told they are unable to not charge for an inspection but would request a refund on my behalf to see if it can be refunded to me due to the difference in assessments that caused the second mechanic to not complete the recommended work
hands down great place
going to canadian tire for any sort of car service even if it was free because they will crash your car into a wall and saythats they way it came in
twenty minutes later she gave us the price of 190 for the same service minus the unnecessary brake fluid flush
im just being cheap but reason i came to try this place was i got a groupon for it  2 car washes for 10 soon as u pull in they check your windshield for scratches  one way for them to do business with your insurance
the staff at this location was very friendly and they got my car in right away
singh as always was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about audis and also the various leasing programs
made it to the desk and just flat out asked someone if they were a salesman and if they could help me
and although i dont think they are the least expensive shop in town i do think you get what you pay for
decided to go for southern nevada locksmith
this place does stellar work
truth is he seemed pretty out of sorts in general and not very professional
ill write a review
i certainly am not a tire expert so i had a lot of questions
and when i show him hes wrong he wont man up
i highly recommend this place for any automotive needs
it was my 1st time at this pep boys location
i originally came here for a flat repair
i own a 2016 jeep grand cherokee overland with about 5500 miles on it which i wanted to trade
and basically he is an overall good person
the strip at las vegas motor speedway is a top notch drag racing facility
marcus lamonis needs to step in and end this location
they didnt fix the original problem
we chose the 30 minute mini baja adventure
a great car wash  best service i have got for a basic car wash  i will be returning any time i am in the area
got another peace ice tea to scan it like that exact ice tea was going to ring up differently than the first one
they hand wash and dry and blow out the crevices so you dont have water streaming across your car as soon as you drive off
not a big deal but stealing is just not okay with me
they are honest reliable and fair
530 and my husband calls to make sure i wasnt murdered or something
my rep wgerber constantly called my cell wany updates and gave an accurate eta of when my car would be finished
couldve called earlier to let me know and i wouldve went somewhere else
other places are 48
would i come back
he claimed i needed a new water pump 2 months ago messed some stuff up
i was done and on my way in about 12 hour  and jason only charged me for the battery  i tipped a little on top just to show my appreciation
i wasted almost 3 hours here today for them to tell me i owed too much on my trade in and that they couldnt finance me at the payment i want
it was the last straw
at this point i was very upset
spent 20 minutes looking for the bolt before he told me what happened
i especially want to mention steve which was my sales rep  amazing
i came in for a basic car wash and the employee tried to get me to buy some 250 detail and i told him im just here for a basic car wash and he kept at it for about 10 minutes
it was ridiculous
sales mikewhy are you doing this to me
seems that few dollars ended up being more like 78 before tax was included
very helpful and thorough service department
ive splurged on one of the more expensive thorough cleanings and they did do a great job
they gave me a 100 warranty for all 4 tires  free
the weather stripping was damaged upon the install and the tech tried to hide the piece by tucking it under the existing  stripping
reynaldo mike lucy  and all the rest were fantastic in making this deal happen
the worst dealership experience i ever had
i called around but since it was memorial day week 4 business days  nearly the end of the month most people were swamped with inspections
i was pleased by this
these guys are great
overall they are telling me they will remedy the situation fully which i feel they may but ive spent too much time trying to get things done and have been extremely frustrated the entire time
avoids calls and doesnt have the decency to keep his word
they are the only shop in las vegas that carries dainese high quality riding gear
the car was washed and detailed in the drive way
its going to be my last
mike himself drove my car for a short while and initially thought it was something minor like perhaps a dented dustguard
but if you can afford it go elsewhere
couldnt be happier with the service that we received
the original estimate was higher than what i had to pay for in the end which was much appreciated
he sent me here
definitely recommend this place
they dont staff the firefly counter in vegas all the time and send you over to dollar with huge lines and long wait times
hard to find a shop nowadays that actually cares about the customer keep up the awesome service guys
the service department does a great job communicating about the status of my vehicle once its in the shop and they have a comfortable waiting area with bottled water tv wifi and breakfast bars
i showed up at my reservation time and was greeted as i walked in the door
the gentleman in the car care center that handled my caranswered the phone  sam was excellent
this was the best car buying experience of my life
when i went to drop my car off i initially drove right by the place because its a filthy little garage that doesnt look like it would even be open
thanks will for your kind customer service to my dear old dad
i had informed him that i was looking for a quote on carpet cleaning and i had taken measurements on the areas that need cleaning
i highly recommend this place and hopefully  they will be 5 star long time
i had to pay for all the damn time spent the original suspected part wasnt the prob but a roll over valve on top of my gas tank
the reason for my 1 star review
ive used this firestone twice and now i realize this is the only one i should keep using
i told him no he had called with a progress report  that was it
c they use a tool to delete the trouble code from the engine computer and will not agree to assist further
this def helps me want to come back because i dont need guys feeling the can scam the girl
the time really goes by fast though
they pulled up my order verified it and get thisthey didnt try and sell me more expensive tires
we begin to follow him but he disappears off ahead
he helped me with a stereo connections for a good sound
my air conditioning system was not working so i went in to have it checkedfixed
thats about the only unfortunate thing though
this place is awesome
treated like a family member
sometimes i leave so satisfied and feeling good about the wash sometimes not so much
so basically discount tire if they damage your property will lie blame you and be rude and disrespectful
to save money many shops would just cut the quarter panel off at the body linenot acceptable to me at all
best mac  cheese ever
very satisfied with the service
dont fall for the windshild repair i didnt do it even though i felt pressured
i emailed the salesperson the link to my sold vehicle so that he would see it was no bull from me
the guy says i dont know what that means
ive sent friends and coworkers here and theyve had equally great results
it had liquid petrol in stock which is a plus
making my appointment was a breeze
now that is exemplary customer service
i have a limited edition vehicle with several high performance andor aftermarket parts so this seemed like reasonable price
one of the things that i do not appreciate is that when at the cash register the cashier or an employee will always try to sell you the upgrade to the executive membership
he had done work on both of their vehicles and still checks up with us from time to time to make sure everything is running smoothly
my cup holders were not cleaned
i went back on 124 the next morning and as soon as i walked in employee melissa said  your check engine light came on again
snacks and such are inexpensive here which is a steal bc at coffee shops youd be spending 3x as much
at the end of 6 months a balloon payment was due of 1206
its great and still my gold standard outside of kidnapping my friends thai mom and having her cook my dishes out of my own kitchen
super reasonable rate and scooters in great condition
i would definitely go back again in the future
free of charge
they cracked the chrome off my door handle and the window doesnt work
2 expensive i didnt pay for it but my insurance but let me tell you the cost was significant
the food is awesome  everything i tried was exceptional and worthy of 5 stars
a paying member feels an attachment
they also offer up cold bottles of waters while you waitgreat hospitality guys
theyve been very accommodating working with me to get the washer i wanted even though it was on back order for 45 days
gas is gas but this location is new clean and convenient
i get all my service work done there too
i have experienced purchasing 2 vehicles here and would recommend any nissan lover to purchase at autonation nissan tempe
the dealership never even checked the air conditioning on the paperwork it shows everything that they checked and the ac was one of them
i called town and country ford where i had bought my personal vehicle a 2002 ford sport trac which i still have and love with over 175212000 miles on it off the show room floor and right away i knew i should had started here
i should have taken it to an unauthorized shop and dealt with whatever trouble it brought because it couldnt have been a bigger pain in the ass than this situation
is this intentional to make the pay stations appear to not work for tourists that are not in the know regarding the green check
my wife had tried to find a quality reliable place to take our vehicles
nervous that this situation might get worse i stopped them  asked chris if purcells would pay to have my car cleaned by a professional
i recently had a ford transit wrapped
they told me i needed new rotors and calipers
she made sure that we had the right lock actuator for my car and then set up an appointment for their mobile service
ive been here a few times now and i feel that gary and his wife are trustworthy and honest something hard to find in lot of mechanics out there
when it came time to crunch some numbers mike the sales manager came over and explained to me how much i got for the trade
when i took my car to a toyota dealership for repair they had no record of my warranty
update i received a phone call last week from rahim because he wanted to resolve the problems ive mentioned on my previous review
i asked for someone to help me fill out the damage form and again i was told that it was on me and if i missed anything i would be charged
the manager tells us he can not honor the price because there are no rebates available now what
like wtf shouldnt you know a little more considering what you are upholding with your position
but no one from car2go is picking up the phone
he did great job on tint my 2015 bmw  it was an excellent price i will be coming back soon to get my windshield tint also
anyways dropped the car off the next day at the scheduled time
i like how it connects to the waterworks mall
he worked late just to get it back to us within the same day
i began calling 5 days prior to my scheduled appointment
no joke he declared it proudly
their charges were reasonable at 112 for the paint job
and the last 6 cars i have owned have been brand new and i drove them all from brand new all the way up to 100k miles before i traded them in
the duck is super tasty too
he and the other clerk went out of their way to help other customers all the way to installing some refrigerant in one customers ac system and diagnosing a code on anothers obd system
when we buy new trucks we have them inspected  first for his approval
recently remodeled and much nicer
its unnecessarily stingy and inconvenient
the car was picked up at a neighborhood sight and not the pittsburgh airport
how would they know
then my credit card was charged an extra 145 for no reason
the best cadillac dealership in az
my smart child said should i take putt putt to pep boys and i said make a beeline girlfriend
be prepared to waste lots of time with these guys
when i pulled into the service bay pamela was very friendly and informative
no goodbye or thank you just a loud next a it left a sour taste in my mouth
everyone was courteous and professional i was quoted the price i expected based on coupons andexcepting the necessity of replacing a paperthin rotor that even my notmechanicallyinclined wife could see was badwound up paying the price i was quoted
then the thing that really pissed me off was that he was telling to go get money from friends and family or trade my guns or other things
by the time we got to beachwood the price increased by 150000when i indicated i was no longer interested my keys were held hostage
made an appointment and they were able to come to my work and install the windshield
we were thrown off at first by the location and how sketchy it is but dont feat
i will continue to come here for service
i was very disappointed in the lack of great customer service this place used to have
if you dont want to stay and wait they have drivers that will drop you off somewhere to pick your car up later
way more than a 6 car wash
its a nice building its clean and the staff is usually very nice
because of the saftey situation brian was able to accommodate my concern
my wife and i just purchased a used chevrolet traverse and were very satisfied with the service
its refreshing to see such professionalism and pride in a job welldone
in comparison to the other salesmen i met with at other dealerships earlier in the week jeremy was literally the only one who was had my best interest in mind which really made an impression on me
turns out there is a 4x5 card taped to the bottom of the gate to the entry lanes that does say their card reader is broken
although they have some safe and chinese inspired dishes which i think they should cut from the menu their specialty is northern thai and the surrounding regions
i definitely recommend toyota of north charlotte for your service needs
there was a lot of work to be done so they kindly asked if they could keep it overnight
so unlike most maintenance shops midas was very honest with charging me for what i actually needed done
such a time waster
i would also note that the prices i encountered on the parts are high at br
i recommend this shop highly from smog checks oil changes to more detailed work
they were very pushy and aggressive
they directed us to a waiting room where there was free donuts and coffee
that shows that this place is busy and highly recommended
but         apparently you can recommended but not open till very late which sux because i think everything in vegas should be open 247
id heard that the chef was once a chef for the queen of thailand and so had been quite impressed w the restaurants reputation and was eager to see if it lived up to the hype
most of the staff i dealt with personally were very unprofessional and provided short uninformative answers
very impressed its nice  clean but not the best customer service
cant imagine paying a few days of late fees on top of that and then it happens
i also dislike how i call in he says to bring it on and he will look i end up waiting 23 hours before my car is looked at
echo the comments from others that their sales department is low pressure and helpful
i asked the server if i could get something without msg and he said ok we wont add any extra to your dish
i would recommend this location to anyone who has car needs
i never want to go back for obvious reasons but they are my first choice in repairs if i ever need to
the best car buying experience i have ever had
the prices arent the cheapest but for things like this you get what you pay for
any how he calls me back with a 800 dollar quote and says that still might not fix the problem but that the car drives in 2nd
also the machine isnt very friendly with low cars
highly recommend contacting them
i have never had such a bad experience with a business
decided to go with 20 on the back windows and 35 on the front two and it looks sick
i did get an awesome car at a fair price so im very happy about that
at sunset auto i like how they thoroughly explained the estimate and what each fee was for
i needed an oil change and thought i could have my windshield replaced at the dealers
and all this gasoline just drenched my friggin arm
my boyfriend serviced his 91 integra ls over a month ago
thank you big o tires
this is the worse place for customer service
you can wait there approximately 6 chairs in the waiting room or since its in a great location you can walk to starbucks or any other restaurant to briefly wait it out
they seem to be helpful
wes and the rest of the auto mobile detective team have been upfront honest and fair
i really couldnt have asked for a better experience and when i need new tires i will definitely be back
we finally got somewhere after asking for the owners information
he asks what im trying to achieve today i tell him im trying to get an idea of what i want to buy
they fixed my car for far less than i was expecting and their lobby has free wifi
i feel they run a good shop over there
this place is the sh
luckily my car was brand new and in perfect condition
drove it home without any problems and saw that the power steering pump was indeed replaced albeit with an aftermarket oem one
i should have listened to my friend when he said camelback fordget out of there
spend the extra money and go somewhere else where are you will be treated with respected and dignity
the price tag was 43xxx
she looked this place up and found a coupon and was hoping to save 1020 on the job
i said i love the car its beautiful all im asking is for you to do what is right and call santan and make sure they do whatever it takes to fix the engine
this facility provided an oil service to my 2005 volvo xc90 in january of 2015  in early april of the same year i noticed that oil was dripping from the oil filter they installed in january
the main kicker of this place was that we went through the tiny inventory for about ten minutes waiting for someone to greet us or ask us if we had questions or anything and we got nothing
thank you richard
they always have what i need and there are times when they do not but the staff are helpful and will directly tell you which location has it or will order it and it will be there usually the next business day
every time i bring my car in at this location for a simple oil change i get it back w a new problem
so of course i was was told i had been approved for full coverage by my existing auto insurance company and that i was good to go
took our 30000 down the street and purchased our mazda elsewhere
marcs glass responded quickly to my request and scheduled a consultation to come to my home to measure the two broken windows
ive yet to get the hard sell here
frank is awesome
so i book a flight to vegas but guess what i call him back hour later but salesman said
i dont like spending money on my car but when i do i know these guys will give me value
they did the job and the car sounds great
i showed up to the appointment and waited for 2 12 hours in their uncomfortable waiting area
ray the guy in charge  slangin  was very friendly and made me feel welcome and set me up with an appointment for a great price
when it comes to choosing a reliable honest and affordable auto mechanic and body shop it can be rather difficult in selecting one you can trust
got the part installed and made it back to vegas safe and sound and not stuck on a desert freeway on a sunday afternoon
he was very easy going and knew plenty about the car we test drove
in the second in the auto section the salesperson  a different one  was highly knowledgeable and helpful about jumper cables and helped me pick a good pair
the employees have a complete lack of integrity and are willing to lie about your service needs in order to make easy money
i pay im pissed and im out the door
our 1998 toyota sienna sprung a radiator leak en route to our sons college graduation on the east coast
frontend is squealing but after reading previous post afraid the brake system may be bad also
ran into antonio and he made the process smooth and easy
this can happen to anyone
i ended up going there to get my e testing failure fixed and they wowed me
i feel like i paid good money and now i have to sink more money into something that should have been done the first time
i am so done with this dealership and i only went to it because it is the closest one to me
honest and helpful mechanics
spark plugs when i felt unnecessary but they are never too pushy
after his explanation as to why my car cannot get a proper alignment he shoves me off to the dealership to have them look at it and get it resolved instead of him fixing the problem himself
i came here the other day with a friend who got her jetta washed and it looked great so i decided to try this place instead of the regular fabulous freddys or something which is where i usually go
not only that but these folks are honest
never going for conveniencecloseness  again
dont take your car here
i wish i had gone to n scottsdale or chandler to buy a car
i guarantee you they will tell you you need your transmission rebuilt
im certain ford paid siriusxm handsomely for this 5year subscription
the new owner tells me that since i have my receipt he will warranty all the windows and redo the job
in august 2013 i took my van in for a back light problem a noise coming from the brakes and my abs light was on
though the gentlemen we had started with seemed to be impatient and unhappy being there it did not change my opinion on the place itself
when i asked after an hour if they had put the damn tester on it yet an hour after it was taken into a garage for a mechanic to look at the service rep eric couldnt be bothered to ask and find out he just repeated ill let you know as soon as i know
i highly recommend this place if you are looking to buy a vehicle
in addition to installing a bed lift system in the back  which they had to interface with suppliers that were generally unhelpful they also designed and installed a custom screened in room that we can use to enclose the back of the toy hauler when the back ramp door is opened and held up by cables to make it a deck
he was incredibly friendly and very helpful
have taken my car here for years and its always mind blowing how great pam and scott are
usually im very hesitant to give out 1 stars but this place deserves it
they now have nozzle air at each vacuum
brand new calipers were now damaged and the blame was placed on the customer
i called spitz and sephen answered
ill definitely recommend them to anyone looking for tint
they could end up blowing their food money
so glad  i didnt pay the 1300 they quoted me
the wash has a large selection of wash species plus a regular rinse and a spot free
i was not belligerent nor rude to him i just asked him when he was going to look at my car
i wont be surprised if my rebate never even shows up
that is not alright with me
my car was in their shop for over a day and afterwards i paid them 50142  for a rear main seal job a very labor intensive 5 hour job
he said i could leave my car overnight if i wanted to
they try to convince you there are chips in your windshield absolutely none are in my new car and they will fix for free
once they have it good luck having promises fulfilled
its worth the drive for quality service and products
i added on a wind deflector after my purchase so that had to be ordered and installed by their service department
i own both honda and yamaha 450s
must say stellar customer service friendly knowledgeable mechanics clean lobby and great prices
he finished their transaction but then pulled out his phone to show the woman who i assume was his children
its clear that his priority is the customer and it is evident in the amazing service he provided us
the inside of the store is always immaculate
when i got there i was demanded to pay 80 and no work was done on my car after 6 hours
highly recommended for any vw owners
great service dannys
even after i showed him the price list that they had posted  and told him what the other guy said  he still wanted to charge me more
does not get more relaxing to wait then this
john is a very honest and fair business owner
you will not be sorry
its hidden in a notsonice strip mall behind the vegas strip but its quite lovely inside the thai spice aroma lifts me off my feet as i float to the table and begin contemplating what new adventure i will offer my mouth with this next order
these pushy clowns love the hard sell
not a fun trip with my 3 young children and mother in tow
when i arrived home there is a large puddle of fresh oil underneath my truck
great guy great service and a great price
i dropped off my car at 200 pm and told them i was bringing it in because of my abs light
i had shopped a competitor in scottsdale i will not share their name just days before my visit to sanderson and lets just say it was extremely less them favorable
everyone at dr auto is friendly and knowledgable
adrian and co did a very thorough job diagnosing the problem and getting back to me in a timely manner
good thing because they would have had to drive to another pep boys to pick up another battery for me
and then came the encore as if his ego somehow couldnt bear to be told no again as if he been told no for the 100th time that day
i just purchased my tires yesterday
i had the car towed to courtesy and they took it in and figured out it was the fuel pump
answered all of my questions in a promptly manner and got my car taken care of in the best way
we did and now a month into owning our new car we are so happy and although we also own a hondai gotta say that i think were hyundai people now
i cut him off and said to shut it down ill take my car elsewhere
nice vip hand wash guys half of my roof was washed
would blow hot air for minutes on initial start up no matter thermostat setting
so i went back  they checked all my tires and found a screw in one and fixed for me no charge
i always try to support local businesss but it was difficult to find a local auto repair shop i actually trust and feel comfortable recommending to a friend
the restaurant offers a full wine list with about 300 different wines
in the end i booked an appointment at a rival mini garage while i waited and have now bought a new mini
the customer service representative that i worked with was very knowledgeable and friendly
quoted a rate over the phone and stuck to it
keep up the good work
they did not deliver it to us on the day of our visit
i wanted to talk it over and said i would call back
dave made another suggestion even saying if this were my car this is what i would do
would definitely recommend as a friendly and affordable alternative to a vw dealer
after you do the touch screen menu you insert your money and the gate arm lifts and allows you to drive up to the wash  you have to stay in your car but thats okay
the convenience store is clean and carries good products
if you value your sanity and money then stay away from these crooks
i couldnt be more please
there will be no attendant at the end of the wash to wipe your car but the last part of the wash totally blows away all the water droplets so you have nothing to worry
reasonably priced as well
based on all the time ive spent on the phone and in this place dealing with them 2 stars is the best im going to give
real talk  i took my car through the carwash here once got a nasty gouge down the side and the guy at the counter didnt seem to care
3 easy chairs on site that require money to use
they walked me through the inspections of my car and the process they will need to complete to get my car fixed
we were only going to give a 2000 tip for both cars but watching mike do something that made things fair he got 4000
the gas cap was not seated properly
i have been here twice for required repairs
and they worked on my car so fast
thanks guys i will definitely be back
he had called first and arranged  the price and what was to be done
hopefully we wont need to be back but if need be we have their
total confidence in this place
the greensburg sams club is always more expensive than this one is
shari   my sincere apologies
specifically he provided technical details and advice on how to talk to the dealer about the problem in his view it was a problem that any car maker with integrity should take the responsibility for repairing
told them my ac compressor seized up i had to remove the clutch to keep the vehicle going
you are better off going to the dealership
i wish i had found adrian a long time ago
i wont be coming back
i will be returning highly recommend
do not go here
go somewhere else if you can
to top it off they did it all for free
i will miss 2b so hard to find a great and honest mechanic
i had a groupon to come here when i first discovered this shop and have been coming back ever since
i had some questions before going in and called the sales rep billy directly
there was no attempt to keep me as a customer and i drove away
they couldve filled it that day not asked questions and probably made more money a couple weeks later when i had to replace my compressor again and have them fill it again
i had been going here for awhile for an oil change and carwash with usually good results
his son is only worried about ripping you off and doing a not even halfway decent job with way overpriced labor
hes an honest and hard working guyyou will not regret coming here
before your car goes through the wash there is an option to fix any chips in your window
we were told we should have received at least two phone calls with updates and that our truck should arrive september 2 we got a call the next day saying it arrived
a wasted time of over three hours
customer service definitely needs to be improved as well as their old software for cash registers
the food took maybe 15 minutes to serve
i spoke to both a salesperson named maryann and their gm david
they seemed clueless
it didnt help that i went to and from home twice over a wheel lock key issue but that part was my own fault
the prior vehicle owner had gotten an inferior paint job on same so additional services were required from the original estimate
this is the only place i go to for any car issues i may have
i had mentioned that i wanted to keep my part for exactly that purpose
i highly recommend this place
i kept trying to go see the car and they would ignore the fact you wanted to see the car you want to buy
and i was told well you can go buy a car from them
collision center of peoria was great
endlich hat mr wash seine waschanlage in stuttgart erffnet  ein muss fr alle autowaschfans
i dont know if this is nissans policy or the servicemans unwillingness to negotiate to keep a customer but i will not bring my nissan back there for service again
they take your keys and hold you hostage they dont listen to you they promise you once price then come back and offer you something much higher
after taking it there and spending only 250 to repair the engine my truck hasnt had any problems
he explained to me that the tire to be repaired was actually the wrong ply rating for my vehicle and could pose a danger
get the shrimp
because not only were the keys missing still but the vehicle had never actually been through inspection and something was wrong with it and needs to be fixed
offered to give me a free ride home after i dropped my car off for an alternator replacement
so when one of ours cars died the ultimate death i was not looking forward to the process of purchasing a new one
there is more to this story but i have other things i value more than providing a complete timeline of the lies and poor service provided by this shop
they are educational they smile and they are relaxed and fun to be around
i wouldnt recommend them to anyone
basically a salvage yard where cars get stored then sold for parts or to be fixed and made roadworthy again
i have been taking my car at the time a new mx5 to keffer mazda for service since i got it
thanks to all of you guys for the great service
im stuck with something i cant use and i paid 59  thats a full tank of gas
the car is perfect for what we need it for its for our company it was in perfect condition and had been expertly detailed
i honestly dont think they have replaced it
translated to your payment will be more
taylor and sergio assured me that i was going to walk out with a great deal and i did
thats right the actual dealer was better customer service than these people
made me feel super welcome in and and was very helpful
upon arrival i advised the employee of what id had done a few days prior and asked him  to have his service techs take a look at the issue with the cv boot leak
after discovering a huge nail in the tire they plugged in in 10 minutes
well i decided to do some shopping after and with my car sitting for awhile and turning it back on it was very hard to steer
they will brainwash you to buy a car and offer you the world but be aware when it comes to servicing your vehicle
since that was the cost that the initial mechanic estimated i decided to have my vehicle towed to his shop
stopped in at discount tire today to find out about a tire repair  woopie  its free
after talking to the store manager to hurry up because i had to go to work they finally installed my tires
not words i use for all car places
apparently its policy to mention anything broken while cleaning
one time one of the cashiers said that the mechanic suggested i take a look at my radiator
thats what insurance company told me
i called cr tire to get information and they were very helpful and nice
do you not need the sales
when i first walked up to my car it didnt seem that clean to me but i thought whatever it looks better than before
went for an oil change service for the first time and for sure will be back again
engine light was also on and dealer was not able to fix it
i guess i should have asked around first
excellent job excellent services and most importantly excellent price at 250 vs dealer  other quotes of over 500
just went in and paid my payment at cash one today and jessica the teller  was amazing always helpful very friendly
my car needs a transmission fluid flush and an oil change
they wanted all my contact information including full address etc
rene vasquez is the only mechanic that i have trusted to take car of my daughters car
my wife and i can only eat so much lunch meat during the week but this will be our go to place to buy it
i too was approached by the glass people  what a scam
the staff was great too will definitely be back
after some time i decided to give them another try
he also made me an offer i could not refuse so i went ahead  bought two tires instead of just one like i originally went in for
great customer service the people here are super friendly and reliable when it comes to inspectingchanging your tire brakes
i was frustrated with looking at cars out of state and in nevada he found a car within days
i highly recommend
i found one who seemed to know what he was talking about at a reasonable price
weird that less than 2hours earlier it was ready for me to testdrive but know it wasnt available can you say baitandswitch
the manager stated it was a clean no accident car with a clean carfax at purchase i guess i should have checked with my own eyes and not believed him lost 4000 on the trade in value because i cant trust this dealer
my husband and i worked with jerry reis highly recommend who was a jeep wrangler owner himself
i told him the issue with my car and the what ifs and he and his fellow workers came to my truck outside to see the potential issue
i highly suggest you find a different place to service your vehicle if you want it to last
the 40 to change a light bulb ticks me off but really thats a car design flaw and i am glad the service department gets it done quickly
take that sizzling summer heat
owner friendly and professional
if your tired of dealing with typical dealerships or the whole car buying experience come see jilmar at honda west and he will take care of you
he tried to point out how the air pump was bolted down properly but only the hose was loose and i said that it would not affect the electrical system
he stated he had nothing to do with it
just had gotten my first oil change not long ago from you guys
jordan accommodated my request to see the rims and tires prior to the install to make sure we are all on the same page
they said the front two should be changed the back two are still good for another 6 months
we bought 2 sets of chains which at 5999set seemed like a good price
the other two items were not even touched but were listed as completed
there were water spots everywhere again how
including the lifetime warranty
from the start for an appointment till the moment the service was completed and step out the door it was provided with excellent care and professionalism
this company is great
after we went elsewhere he sent me text messages calling me a liar and making me feel very uncomfortable
instead i wanted a place that specializes in new car protection
that same tank of gas gets sold and partially resold so many times it must generate fantastic profits
dropped off our nissan rogue four days ago and they just started work on it this morning
best experience by far ive ever had in purchasing a new vehicle
screwed me out of about 5000 by selling me a bent set of asantis
remember your car also needs tlc
the sale process took less than an hour we spent maybe 3 hours at the dealer total hunting questions test drive purchase finance etc
they were nice enough to pick me up from the airport and take me to  the dealership the day i was picking the car up
sooo happy thank you bill and lina
i pass 4 stations between this one and homeservice does and will change patterns
they always say they are busyisnt returning calls their job
great place to buy a car
hope you feel so happy causing others bs
jenny made the entire experience a delight
it definitely made me feel like i should have bought life insurance also before getting into this car
i got an excellent car for an excellent price and all thanks to these men and this dealership for making it all possible
id heard such great things about your service that i assumed it would be fine
he made us feel at ease given the stressful situation
if youre in the market for a car and dont stop here to see marko youre cheating yourself
a decent chunk of change
meanwhile they dont keep your original dealer in the loop about a trade in
i would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for an honest shop
i drove down checked in and took a seat
he made the process quick and easy
their shuttle driver peter was very kind with suggesting places to go and prompt with dropping me off at the nearby mall
a service writer christian attempted to sell me 2 tires that only needed to be rotated
i booked a van ready to pay 1999 plus some mileage
we told them we would be calling a couple of more places before we committed to him
they may be hard to find but once you doyelp them
dan got me in instantly and out in less than one hour
it looks awesome drives correct
they also keep that garage very clean which is something i check for if someone is doing work for me
therefore who would want a repair shop to work on their vehicle when false information was entered on the repair estimate and no return call
with that said salesman goes talks to the manager and comes back at us with 49apr
she did not tell me there was a 60 installation fee i had assumed that was all included in the price of the windshield that i was quoted
just had an exterior wash polish and sealant from the guys at gannon and i am very impressed with their service
he has always been available has gotten me in on short notice and gets it taken care of
these clowns need supervision
furthermore they read out the last 4 digits of your phone number now so you have no way of knowing where you are in line
i had them install a used diesel engine new carpet radiator and other work
i am a service advisor myself at a high end dealership so i am always on the critical side when im dealing with someone that does the same job i do
the vehicle also supports 4 beds too
i was buying a car from someone and had it taken into action to get checked out
none of these 5 star reviews have accurate information in them take it from me i dealt with these people and know that once the deal is dead for them they decide to walk away
took it back they denied any responsibility for it saying the car was fine when it left their shop
staff was friendly and helpful as always
look im not going to have a customer dictate to be what needs to be fixed  long story short they refused to do any work on my truck  after they broke the engine down to the block  unless i allowed them to fix a whole bunch of things that werent broken
i talked to mike to make appointments and got my girlfriends dodge journey  and my scion xb in
very fast service friendly staff and always a pleasant experience
the q7 didnt seem quite right either
no one tried to con me into buying a service for something i didnt need
showcase honda was able to match arrowhead hondas price they originally quoted me for gave me all the options and accessories i wanted and more
booked my suv in for an oil changeroutine maintenance
nobody ever calls me back
not to mention a small fam owned business who treats all the clients like family is what makes us return each and everytime
i have three dogs so this was much needed
he was patient and willing to work with my situation until he found the best solution for me
i come here from time to time and am usually disappointed but since my company pays to have this fleet vehicle washed i come for convenience
if this is how service is run i wonder how the sales staff operates
even more so they actually swapped out the muffler the next day after i thought the one i originally had was too loud for my liking
i can keep going
apache has never been pushy with sales
they tried to tell me that all of this stuff happened in 3 months since my vehicle was last in their shop
i finally ended up sending an email to the general manager of zimbrick eastside detailing everything that had happened and i never got a reply
it was nice that the carpets dried in about an hour
many dishes can be modified if spice isnt your thing
again after a brief phone tree routine i was pleased with the customer service
all in all my dad was out of there in less than an hour and didnt have to wait a single unnecessary minute
i tried that person and they said i needed to drive my car back 900 mile roundtrip for him to evaluate it
this one does the trick its one of the few in the downtown area its only 2 for about 4 minutes the stations are clean and its pretty empty when i go during my lunch break or after work
ive already paid 1000 as a down payment and he still had not started working on my truck
go see them you wont regret it
the first time was fine  not particularly good not particularly bad
pete is a great guy and totally professional
the tank looks brand new no rust no holes nothing is wrong but it needs to be replaced
my vacation had to be cancelled because i cant drive in 100 degrees with no ac and my oil change visit cost me the 200 at jiffy lube and over 500 at the dealer when the part arrives
this is the only ford dealership that i feel comfortable coming to
if someone is a walk in and has a crazy problem dont make the loyal customers who have appointments suffer for it
after the first week the car still looked like it had just been detailed
he was very thorough and professional
i finally left the booth and asked what was going on
they reported the coolant level being low and refilled added die for leakage ect
my husband called on a ford explorer that was listed ready today
these guys are the best
we shopped in person looked over and compared many units
the problem was when they drained the regular oil it came out black
you can tell them what kind of car you have when you get there and let them know what you need and they can use their computer to look it up for you
im a fan yay
i couldnt be any happier and feel fortunate to have found this place
29 to wash my truck
great communication before and after service  never an issue
fortunately i recently had a very good experience with a bike purchase from ridenow
first thing out of the guys mouth when encountering a new customer
they are family owned and operated and you can tell they love family and kids
we have a few vehicles and i can say that no one else will touch my vehicles
i saw one man pound on my brake drum so hard and on the oil change
i feel i received terrible and incomplete service
it had a lot more than the one we initially were going to get but they did give us a bit of a discount on a few items
i will never take my car to get serviced there
this team is top notch
when i went inside i was shocked to see a full service sandwich bar selling high end pressed sandwiches like cubans jamaican jerked chicken eggplant parmigiana and capresi
they will be getting my business for years to come
the guy who helped me at the end was very accommodating but overall i think its overpriced when they dont get the car totally clean
the ladies behind the counter are more interested in talking amongst themselves than paying attention to customers and beware the morning maintenance guygas station gestapo
the bakery is very good and i like their rolls and cookies
the car came out spotless
the red haired cashieras she was ringing me up heard it and burst into laughter
do not hesitate to use rg motorworks
i go over to east mesa auto they told me they would figure it out and guarantee the diagnosis
its easy to get to but a little hard to find you can not see it from the street
dan and caesar were great
the owner  im assuming from reading reviews came out to ring us out  let me know what else it needed
las vegas collision center went above and beyond in regards to the repairs and customer service
the one very minor complaint i have is that while signing the final paperwork with the ford person joint dealership i mentioned that i wanted to hurry and was not interested in purchasing additional warranties
yet more damage to my vehicle from penske auto glass
the only purpose of this company is to pump money out of tax payers therefore they use archaic technology that ruins vehicles and provide some of the single worst customer service ive ever seen
the terrain was amazing remember the arcade game off road
kudos mr city  you know your craft
we were told it wasnt their fault because it was a used vehicle and there are no guarantees
i knew i would not be back to purchase from them and they turned me off on even buying
on too of this there is no negotiation in price
because i wanted synthetic i just had to pay 14
though she calls far in advance to get a cab theyre frequently late leaving her standing out in the cold on crutches she has to get down the stairs in her apartment in plenty of time to catch the cab and she cant just go back inside if theyre late
ok first i never have actually liked any dealership service department
i purchased a certified used tacoma pickup truck from bell road toyota last month
he says it could affect the sensor reading and that its probably messed up because of the product
everyone was so kind and helpful
since uncle bobs storage is right down the street and also the least expensive we could find in the area although not by much it seemed like the review could be bypassed
he had no answer for me
however after driving it she loved it
they charged double for a simple battery install that id get most anywhere else
trip to brazil come back ac isnt working check gauge light back on
like most people my wife and i work long hours during the week
service manager claim no fault because of tampering
he clearly takes pride in his company and wants to make sure that you leave happy
i have a coupon for a 999 oil change
i agreed to the extra repairs and when i got to pick up my car the total came to almost 250 more than what i was quoted
the response was that he did not know the situation with my car and has not been looked at because i brought my car in at the beginning of the morning at about 745am for my 11am appointment
patrick promptly connected his test equipment and ran several test
when i called they would say its just now being brought to the back
i was assured a couple of times that they would order the part and call menever happened
i got my brake pads and oil changed
he continued to say how it was unprofessional of me to steer business away from him by speaking to his customer
love having a place like this in the kensington market so you dont have to waste your time with the big corporations
one of the most pleasant buying experiences ive ever had
the mechanics and the owner bob are great
all o got was a free spray wax by evan
i couldnt believe how he  his techs did all of this  pro bono
the number is still in my phone as this sort of thing happens to me at least once a year
sticker after oil change every time ive gotten it from don miller is for 3000 mile oil change frequency
i was so angry i just left
the best part is getting free upgrades by being able to choose from an array of vehicles designated for emerald club members
i get there and speak with the most inconsiderate man i have ever spoke too and he said no way can we do that so i tell him i just got off the phone with the lady 20 min ago and she said no problem bring it in and he gos on to say he dont care what she told me that it is not going to happen
i was too full to get dessert however i had some nice green tea that was done exactly right so i left lotus of siam smiling happily and am planning to return next time i am in the area
this was our first rv purchase and we appreciated that cw took great care of us
once there he deftly parked my car answered any questions i had checked in with my mechanic to make sure everything was cool and then he was off to go help other outofluck folks
everything was wiped and vacuumed accordingly
later i drove down to the dealership when i arrived i was not greeted by anyone i had to wonder around passing lots of people in blue honda west shirts
now i have to admit i live in the heart of downtown toronto and that makes zipcar a lot more readily available to me
bought a new to me truck and i cant even drive it
someone finally came up to meon my third attempt calling the store
had a great time with a bachelor party
this is more of a uhaul review than a review of this location
he is very patient and professional
if i could give it zero stars i would
better than walmart i would say
he said he would call me back after he checks on the issue
we call these guys about it we can advance to our move in date and they were able to help us out with no additional problems
a little bummed they are closing part of the lot off for some archeological dig but it wont change my pattern of using them almost every other week
i selected llumar ceramic film and it is doing an incredible job of keeping heat out of the cockpit
i took my van in today 1916
i got a rental car at no charge
she sounds like a nut
the wantons the sea bass which seems to be a perpetual special
they never left any trash in my car unlike other auto bell locations
my car is new and was not very dirty
i didnt have a canadian tire money card
made an appointment and came the next day
first the oil was overfilled past the hash marks and in fact past the indents on the dipstick
i have an older diesel pusher motor home and finding the correct double windshields took some time
this places has one of the worst customer service i have ever seen
my husband and i took his toyota tundra to this car wash for a total detail job
i would recommend this tire shop to anyone in a hurry or just needing some basic tire stuff done
his price matching tactics are reminiscent  of a time share presentation
its full synthetic so not that big a deal  annoying but i just marked the calendar in my blackberry to remind me a few months down the road
if i could i would give this shithole zero starsmatter of fact negative stars
it is great with the crispy duck
smog busters is literally a shack located in the same lot as shell gas station sw corner of twain and ft apache
doug was great very polite and knowledgeable  kept me up to date about the cars progress
the office and her reaked of pot i will be finding out who the owner of this place is and contacting them
they told me i would have to put in a claim for it
sat there for about 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging i was even there
my wife and i are new to the area and were in need of a good quality pre owned vehicle
or anything remotely close to what you asked for in the first place
buy from them
b even though my 1 year old jeep tradein was in perfect shape the postcard i was mailed that told me what theyd give me for my trade was a total lie
i take my car over to the dealer where they tell me i only need a 2 piece to fix it
among this list is an alignment sheet saying my car is out of alignment
here is just the basic every day things not much of a huge selection
will definitely be using enterprise when i return to phx
i was visiting family in another state and flew into the phoenix while my wife and kids drove the truck down from las vegas
she further stated that due to the labor day holiday weekend the car may not be available until 9214 but she would back date the contract to 83114 because she wanted to include it in her august sales
id choose this gas station over others for that alone
nice waiting room fast servicegreat day
we never did have to put more gasoline in the vehicle
he said well i guess well have to put you in a rental car then if thats what i have to do and told me to go to hertz to pick one up
each time ive come here shopping with friends the sales associates have been friendly helpful and most importantly patient
today i get here and they are 80 each and have to be ordered
we got back to the parking lot and my car was waiting outside with the snow scraped off the windshield and back window all warmed up for me and ready for my drive back to my home town
i called on friday and was told as soon as a driver came in they would send the part out
so saved at least 1000 and i guess it just goes to show if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself
ive taken my 14 year old suv to this facility since it opened several years back
if you value your time money and sanity  do not take your car here
no big sign at the front
fernando is the worse low class salesman i have ever dealt with in my life
first the positive friendly front desk man
this is way to frustrating and not worth my time
my dirty black car came back looking amazing
they overprice their products and then put high sale price in many situation customers are not really saving
get your car fixed here but i cant imagine the hassle youd get if you were actually looking to buy a car
lotus of siam is a tad bit more expensive and you get a bit less of food than at other thai food places
the salesman jason santos was professional nice and very helpful
i wish ford hadnt stopped making the ranger so that i could have found one elsewhere with equally low mileage
i had a deal a good deal so i brought it here thinking at least id get another 50000 off
and this visit came to just under 130
mike asked them to double check that the tranny was good and after receiving assurances from them ordered it and called me to schedule an appointment
he got extremely rude when i started asking questions instead of going in there in person
they seem to care about their business and not ripping you off
i checked my mirror and could see he was full of
the waiting area is small but you have chairs a tv and magazines
while i was there a ring that has sentimental value to me fell out of my pocket
i can hardly drive it because of the back injury so i dont pay much attention to the car for several more weeks
the garlic prawns were definitely super crispy and flavorful
got my lexus tinted windows here the results were amazing it had no bubbles nor scratches
once again they are great on customer service and are very cautious of their work and customers requests lets just say
i even considered driving at night but that wouldnt have been safe either
turns out since my car is from ca it was on because it would have failed the smog test
a little annoyed but still had plenty of time
um  crispy shrimp
i cannot recommend this shop
i told him exactly what i wanted fix the day i dropped it off
the shuttle was fast and the man who drove it also very nice
meiling chingling and lingling
not so much for the car but for the service lack of service
oh and for the first few months of trying to sign up online to pay the storage they couldnt find my account maybe its because they put in the gate code that i chose wrong
but dont take my word for it
this is one excellent dealership all the way around from sales to service to parts
why have the option to make appointments if you overbook them and make your customers wait excessively
their customer service is second to none
they have an automated answering machine and no one ever picks up the phone
the lr4 is awesome and its hard to fathom i am actually writing a 5 star comment about a auto dealership and buying experience
was 400 here but 260 on ebay and im dealing with an experienced installer on craigslist
really know how to treat customers
before even looking at it he said it may be an easier fix than i may think and he was right
i guess since theyre one of not many mini dealers in the area he felt he could get away with it or i wouldnt notice it
i picked up the car a couple weeks later and it looked just ok
we went back for another battery this week and just wow
as the food goes its pretty goodbut overrated
i just bought a 2016 honda fit and i love it
i have had a great first time experience with this dealership
i got an estimate from the hudson ntb and the price for the same tires was almost 100 cheaper compared to lakewood without any discounts
its often upwards of 30 for other places 4 the guys are nice there
any savvy buyer would be put off and insulted by their tactics
thats all we want out of our automotive service
while i was driving i received a call from the sales manager i was dealing with but i did not listen to the voicemail until i got there
they also made me feel comfortable about leaving my car for a few days
has a shop full of cars that never leave because nobody ever actually works on them
its been at least 6 months since ive done the repair everything still works fine thanks mike
will not coming back here again and i will not recommend this place to anybody
friendliest guys and so helpful
after that i had no intention on purchasing a vehicle from pgh east but after talking to my husband and because the salesman was nice and not pushy like a lot of salesman can be we decided to give him a call 2 days later and make an offer on the vehicle
locally i also sent the letter to this actual location and its been nearly a month now and i still havent heard back
the only reason i wouldnt give them 5 stars is because the prices for the oil change are too high
ive purchased two cars from them and have worked with 4 of their consultants
worst business practice ive seen
it was a pleasant experience and i will definitely return for future purchases
the manager is even working out back
very nice and professional
ian in financing came up with a great deal for us as well
easy in easy out inexpensive 10 for exterior wash friendly employees and no annoying salesmen trying to upsell me on unwanted services
refill propane tanks starting at 7am
half way to vegas my transmission started slipping severely
so rather than let me leave they made sure it was done to the best of their ability
extremely friendly communicative and wouldnt settle till i was completely satisfied
thats setting the bar pretty low
they then refunded me only 100 dollars due to the fact i saw the receipt they had and that i was still responsible for a 250 repossession that never took place
he really doesnt try to upsell you on anything
the brown sauce was flavorful although i would have preferred it to be a bit more spicy
they left my car spotless
the coffee is not too bad either
the vp of gruelichs called us sunday morning and directed the manager mike to meet us there to get the car
also a thank you to andrew and chris that worked the late evening car pick up for their help last night
we hit a deer at 75 mph in nebraska and got our minivan repaired just enough to get us home
camelback gave us a great deal on the 4runner we wanted and a fair price on our tradein
not in the best neighborhood but the food is wonderful
the entire staff is very inexperienced and confused
i went to 3 different tire competitors and they were 100 cheaper for the same tires
and he didnt even care my son 5 month old couldve been hurt
above and beyond the type of service youd expect friendly personel and zack helped me out of a real bind
they were able to look at my car earlier than expected and even though i did not receive good news about the condition they were more than understanding about me not going forward with fixing it
i drive across town just to have my vehicle serviced by these guys
they have everything including a massive selection of iced tea
first time here
definitely order either the coconut ice cream or a thai tea just to cut some of that spice yes if you dont get a reservation the wait is atrocious
my front bumper had bug marks and they were never removed
i took before and after pictures
they took about 2 hrs for a full interior and exterior detail
the repair was done and i picked up the bike
completely disreputable company with delay tactics meant to leave the vehicle owner shouldering the cost of repairs
i tried to return my rv step covers and the tattooed girl said she could only give me back the money for the rv step covers and would not give me the 2000 coupon
1 hour later after talking to conrads on the phone in which they treated me with disrespect in a condescending way  i put on my emergency lights and drove to conrads
i call back and the dispatcher said he said 1 or 2 blocks away
just wanna say to everyone give sun auto service a try to serve youi bet you wont be disappointed
always being on the road in the city you need a few neciisities comfort great ride air conditioning and of course great gas mileage
steve later showed me something about the oil filters that a distributor was trying to sell him
thank you jared van aken for your exceptional service
i recently visited for a routine rotation and was very pleased with the entire experience
they will always have my business going forward
i will never rent from them again
i told the employees today specifically to make sure they vacuum the backlast time they didnt
consistently the interior looks like it has been untouched
maybe because this location had just opened days before my first stop we didnt care for the 4 or 5 food items but by now those expected kinks may have ironed themselves out so give it a try for something quick to eat after gassing up
the layout of the carwash is very confusing you drive in and nobody immediately meets you
dont  know why all the hype
whats not to love
always taken my vehicles in to firestone
this is when i realized they were trying to get out of a mistake that they causedso i looked at terry and the mechanic and said well when i came in here today for an oil changewas this part broken
the worst customer service from both i have ever received
i will never go back to this location and i do not recommend them
best place by far
it was 3 weeks before i got the vehicle backthe work cost 8100 it looks great no denying that however i went to my dealership as i was planning on trading it in only to be told that they are suspicious of my claim
i was quoted a price before the job started which included throwing out my plastic bed liner
under 400 out of the door including labor coolant and the hose
will be stopping in more often to take advantage of the price match program for future purposes
i tried to speak with two other service reps but they had no record of my car being there
i would highly recommend as the 4141f bus stops right there and you can drop your car off early
i was happy with the efficiency of the service the good initial phone call which was polite and helpful and how quickly i could get my windows replaced since i use my car for work
seriously why the fuck r u working there
i confirmed they had a shuttle but he told me they dont start the shuttle until 730
so reasonable for hand car wash locally owned by a mother n daughter team that also own harveys bar and wineburger next door
guys were nice enough
to their credit they will get you financed even if it means going upside down for the rest of your life
i probably should have went inside and talked to a manager but i just didnt want to deal with it and i would be doubtful the behavior would be corrected
it doesnt matter if u show up 30 minutes before they close you shouldnt have to deal with smart ass attendants who call you big guy and make u wait in line when there are open lanes
the only nice person there was a manager named mike
i went in for an oil change had a scheduled appointment ahead of time and they took 2 hours to do it
i know it was only 7 for the wash but it left worlds to be desired
great customer service
you said your time wasnt free but me not having a car for 3 days wasnt free either
always superfriendly over the phone and a pleasure to work with
we will not be back
we made a online reservation and were charged
also a sign is up saying that they will not install any parts brought in from outside
i guess i expected more than a message saying sorry cant help you
on my first visit they had my car fixed in less than 2 hours
and very responsive to my phone calls
i went to your new shop on cenntennial and 5th  on sat at 345pm for a oil change and the fluids change and i told them my daughter put oil into the car and forgot to put the cap back on  so oil is all over but my car is ok the guy say ok so when i came back at 530 for my car they told me i had to bring  it back on mon because it was to late to do a oil change and fluids
so beware of this dealership
they got me in same day  done before they closed
the staff is friendly as well
and your wallet
definitely will be coming back for sureeasy to work with
we were in and out in a few hours which is to be expected when getting a new car
when i came back for it they tried selling me on multiple items that either my truck didnt need or i didnt feel comfortable with them doing because it was a diesel
its a cogocitgo combo
nothing like watching employees with their pants pulled down around their asses looking all confused trying to figure out which side of the towel to use to dry your vehicle
my interactions with the service writers and the mechanic warrant the extra star
we waited 45minutes for someone to tell us he wasnt there
the third associate said i could take the display modelbut then never came back when she went to try to find the box for it
i really appreciate the work they did and how easy they made it for me
thanks guys for treating her great
i found this shop on yelp here
we had a fun talk on the way to my house and he even parked the car perfectly in our driveway
their solution was to replace the other front tire at no charge
they dont care about you or your car
and not once on the way out did he even try to salvage the sale and not one manager or other sales associate even came to see why we were storming out of there
he was the one who suggested the right vehicle after testing a few models and styles found it on the lot did my test drive put the temporary plates on the new car removed my personalized plates from my tradein they gave me a very fair and decent price did the full and i mean fully 100 no holds barred training and setup of the car for me
these guys are great
i asked for  a quote for that and was surprised to get a 50 quote
we bought a certified preowned chrysler crossfire here and the service was pretty good for a car dealership
my wife pays about 49 to get a full synthetic oil change at zimbrick chevrolet
you really dont need to bring the coupons just mention that youve seen it and they can apply it
not to mention they are unethical and gave money to political cronies in support of prop 123  crooked company
very organized and knowledgeable people who will not steer you wrong
at least with a dealer they know the models and not some yahoo reject
my recommendation is not to assume that because our coach is old that we dont keep it clean  so invest in a large roll of news print and lay it down
being a woman i am always skeptical of getting my car fixed by men
some people at the table didnt like it because the sausage is sour but its supposed to be
really nice car wash clean environment and made my car look nice and shiny
ok  but then the next odd thing happens
san tan honda was hands down the best dealer experience weve ever enjoyed
the driver inspects his bumper and theres no damage so he leaves
so at 1000am i walked across the street to see my car still sitting outside
i know this is normal in some places but all of the toyota dealers that i have gone to all provided this service complimentary and go above and beyond to provide me with great service
were so grateful to have found a place we can trust
i actually found them through the yelp reviews and after comparing their reviews and prices to three other places i decided to bring my car here
this will definitely make me think twice before purchasing another vehicle from surprise fordof which we purchased 3 in one month from them but never again
they said i needed all these new parts and all these things needed to be fixed
and to our surprise there was a very long line at budget
if you want to save some money check these guys out
see ya next time
oh and you can browse their inventory online and they can ship down any car from reno that you like thats what we did for  no cost
after 3 warranty repair trips with no success including to a vw dealer thanks sunnyside and ganley maria and the gang got my car in figured out what was wrong and actually fixed it
later that week i went to towbin dodge in henderson and i bought the same exact car for 24000
the trick to their 9900 deal goes like this  you present your coupon for 99 limited lifetime warranty brakes  shoes for car including the installation and theyll inspect everything cousin related to the  brake system and of coarse there will be made up problems and they will annotate it on your vehicles history attached to the serial numberclass of the 99 deal you bought and then next time you go for your check up and claim your warranty they will state that because you did not get the suggested recommendations that your warranty becomes nullvoid
the car still had bug spots streaks and smeary windows
we took my daughters car in as she was having issues with the car stalling out in intersections and gas was leaking from the rear of the gas tank
we were given 3 options with horrible pictures to choose from
today was even worse than the last time
great carwash great convenient store great customer service
very poorly run service department
20 off most dealershipbranded ts and 40 off their christmas ts
these guy went over and beyond for me
they made what can usually be a hassle into a seamless experience
royce was amazing
i like this location too because the parking lot is pretty big and theres always room
let me seefor the privledge of having my car repaired at a premium cost i might add at their center i nees to pay an additional 100 just to diagnose
very accommodating to take all of our photo needs
i paid for the platinum coverage of the toyota extra care service but the handout i received from toyota financial services showed that my coverage level was gold lower coverage level
i am so upset that i didnt read the reviews on yelp before i went to the extremely poor dealership
im so happy with the service i received from oscar and charlene at dealers choice
so i called and talked to the guy who helped me before  randy and if course he was amazing
3rd i got an alignment done 80 and the report they gave me showed that tires were still off centered border lining on the unaccepatable range  the tech was unable to explain what the numbers meant but said that was usually as close as they can get and the car still pulls the same way it did before i took it in
i know that i am in good hands whenever i bring my car there
customer service a staff knowledge a you guys are honest and i look forward to stopping by more often
no problems ever since
easiest experience ive had
all my family will use this company from now on because of the outstanding customer service i received
i got in my car when they were through and looked directly into my cupholder which still had coffee drips and crumbs  great
that in itself is ridculous
should have switched long before this
mario and his staff are very helpful and friendly i will recommend them to everyone
i live in virginia but my car was in charlotte and i had to have my car towed here
do not ever use this service
we rented 5 electric bikes and had the best time in our trip to montreal
i am now getting emails from the internet dir once again insulting me that    hes sorry im confused but would still like to sell me a car
we went back this morning to pick it up
i went to buy a car from them on a saturday an urgent basis and was assured that the car would most likely be there by monday tuesday at the latest
their customer service has improved over the past five years and they actually acknowledge your presence when you walk in as opposed to pretending like you dont exist until youre walking out of the door in a huff yes thats happened to me before at this location
i have to say my favorite part though is the fact he set up my appointment and was available to come to me and actually did the repairs and service right in the parking lot of my office before i had meeting and such to attend
should i mention the kitchen forgot two key ingredients in my 11 salad
though i would be up shis creek when it came down to price because costco is the supposed price leader
they do their service at a fair price and are very honest
i will be recommending bmw of henderson to friends family and associates
well done guys and thank you very much
he tried to increase the price to 2800
needless to say they didnt do their job  i got charged for the rent a car bcuz they didnt handle the extension that was needed
i spoke to a salesperson bosko who was very nice and gave him my code for a nissan vpp corporate deal
he said i dont know about our website but the gm website says we dont have any
they dont even say where to go so there is no suspicion they are sending you to their cousins up the street
i will be back
car was towed there and they reported to me that i needed a repair that would cost around 400 and the diagnostic fee was 110
ill follow up with what happens next about getting either my large down payment back or getting them to eat it on the loan paper work they gave to to drive the car away with the dealership listed as my lien holder
they have a large selection also to choose from and the staff is very friendly and professional best prices in town hands downif you are shopping for new tires this is the place you will not get better prices nowhere else
i got my oil changed and was suprised to have a lot more done without extra charges
when i returned i see vanessa taking down my wifes information in a credit history check application
i especially like their food court where you can get frozen yogurt and my favourite  mocha freeze
his shop is located in chinatown its a small shop in an industrial business complex
auto nation had countless chances to make it right already so no i dont want to make it right
i have this coupon thats good for 2000 dollars down and i can probably get you 4000 for your trade
if i have any complaint at all it would be with the keyless entry factory set security code
what happened to that 4000 i put down
the thai tea is yummy
they are the best shop in town
yesterday i called back and made them move my service representative to jim who has always been professional and genuinely expresses concern of my vehicle and customer satisfaction
beyond 3 hours of wait for a scheduled oil change is unacceptable
i was so happy he then told me but the payment is not going to be what we told you
being an emerald club member has the additional benefit of skipping all lines and simply picking a car from the lot
get to the counter and there is a 35 minute wait
this guy is a superstar
my wife and i walked in with an online quote and they made it happen
i am glad i chose bill luke fiat for the place to buy my preowned explorer
life decided to keep throwing rocks at me and apparently pebbles at my windshield leaving a decent crack on my windshield
i bought a used f150 from airpark
apple used to care about its customers but now theyve got everyone exactly where they want them and the customer has zero rights
from the moment i walked into the dealership to the moment i left they were kind generous with my deal and made me feel extremely comfortable
do not trust these people
i said my story will be heard
im writing this going on hour 2 waiting for my reservation
i will come back when i need their service
a man who was just leaving said he had been in line for an hour
i will definitely buy cars from this dealership in the future
will never go there again
one of the reviews i read was from a guy that actually lived in another state and brought his vehicles here when visiting on business
42 is expensive but didnt have a wait
my wife and i were interested in a 2008 hyundai santa fe they had
saw her speaking with the manager but no response
world class service and class acts if you ask me
i brought my car in kinda dirty and when i picked it up it was so clean on the inside and out
he said to sit tight until tomorrow as he was doubtful he would be able to get the gm on the line who was not at the dealership
food  mediocre at best
big john and joey johnson helped out big time
i was about to head up to colorado so they saved me  the entire staff was so polite and friendly
thank you all and i highly recommend giving them a try
i didnt like the food and cant believe people actually wait in line for this place
which is pretty much all the time
stewart detailing is the first true hand wash and dry i have found that is in my area reasonably priced and seems to perform a very good wash  the only thing i have noticed is the bug cleaning on the front is not a thorough as it should be and i tend to finish the job when i get home
they estimated a week for the repairs to be finished i was a little worried it wouldnt be done by that time since it was in a terrible shape
best buy wont take back the tivo
simply put everything about this dealership is absolutely awful
just had my first tire repair done at big o  the staff was friendly and courteous and they were done in a matter of minutes
really bustling and waiters earning their tips
they check your warranty explain why service needs to be done and dont pressure you to have too many unnecessary work
personnellement jai souvent eu loccasion dattendre dans cette gare principalement  pour me rendre  ottawa avec la compagnie greyhound et  qubec avec orlans express
only changes besides oil the past 5 years have been rear brakes and just recently a new battery
however getting to him was an adventure
since my last review i still have received the same level of great service
so nice of him
i recently purchased a 2010 mini cooper s from carmax and also an extended warranty on it because ive heard these cars come with some issues
after reviewing those pics i realized that that bent fork wasnt bent in my pics
so for the 1st service i had to get done was the part b service which to my understanding is pretty much is the function check  cooling system brakes windshield wipers and filter
the big difference not even considering their lower prices and having so many options to choose  from was they listened to what i wanted do and made matter of fact confident choices on what would work best and they were spot on
after i decided to purchase he helped me through the paperwork fairly painlessly
he understands that time is valuable so he managed to give me all the details and info on the car more quickly than most dealers greetings
it was perfect timing and they were very quick and friendly
they were charging normal rates but something told me just not to trust the guy
when they replaced the passenger side door it was painted but not well
normally to retint my 90 honda civic hatchback would cost over 250
i would highly recommend affordable german for anyone that needs volkswagen engine repair
i only wish i had read yelp first before my husband even went there to check out the car because i can bet that he wouldnt have bothered
pricey but thats what you should expect when going to a dealership
love this company and have referred many of my friends and family to them
battery starting leaking under 120 days oil life came on first month the leather was upholstery painted which faded away in 60 days beautiful inventory expensive sprawling property
the interior and exterior are both spotless
we brought the car and was promised a warranty
this place is awesome
after going back and forth i just said that ill just take it to someone that will fix the car not going to argue with you
slammed my brakes and pumped to the next shop over to get my brakes fixed right
hows that for bad
i stop here once and a while to pick up a 6 pack after a long day
they are honest and truly skilled
i literally was in here for 58min max
hopefully this review helps the blind and uneducated that go to your dealership
i definitely would go for lexus now once i can get this stupid vin issue situated
i found me a mini honda prelude heaven
i drove from scottsdale so i ended up missing half a day of work for a 90 minute service
cheaper than dealership but a little more expensive than your lowest rung auto shops
best car dealership in town
i have requested laura and her boss john to pick up the tab  or part of it for the rental car or make alternate arrangements to ship the car to us through another carrier but they refused
i was apparently told whatever was needed to make me think all was well throughout this whole ordeal
usually when you see a company with so many 5 star reviews you think its too good to be true
id have to bring my car back another day
this time tires
two ladies on my plane experienced this same problem they were in line before me
i appreciate the straightforward simple language about what my car needs
only 2 docks were full so pulled right in
i then came back on a saturday to get the back brakes done and although they were very busy i was out of there quickly
i am writing the review in hopes that others will not experience the same horrible situation as i did
we didnt show up with financing available so he sent us to andrew and mt fcu and we were able to call and get approved with a trip to see andrew right down the streetall awhile mark was addressing some minor issues we had with truck and before you know iti was off with a truck i loved
like absolutely adore all the people that work here
sarcastically 15 mins
sounds like he is avoiding us
i hadnt bothered to check it when i left bromleys
needles to say she was pretty embarrassed when she realized that i had caught her in a bold face lie
they looked at the car and sent someone to polish the hood on the way home i noticed that the dash was shiny and the so called protectorent was shiny and everything on the dash was dripping this stinky substance
this is an extremely busy location but having the fast pass makes it worth it since you can bypass the line
i was in the middle of a serious repair dispute from a day earlier with subaru supercenter of chandler
he recently sent me an email that said i really enjoyed helping you select your new toyota corolla and that customer satisfaction is at the heart of how we do business
now i dont trust anyone else to work on my car because they do such great work
ive dealt with a handful of body shops but sw collision takes the cake
from marlene to the mechanics everyone was great
he knows the products and is willing to spend the time sharing his knowledge with you
i explained this to him and informed him i was definitely going to buy the car at that price but wouldnt be able to get there until friday
i had been turned away in past by dealerships for my credit
been driving over 20 years and bought many cars
edit 2  after city tv aired a news spot about his practices  michael low finally paid me back a portion of the money he owed me 4 months later
the place is always very busy because everyone loves it
all of it was very flavorful
i chose this repair shop because when i called to ask a bunch of questions andrew wasnt in a rush and was very helpful
over the past several years both looking and purchasing both new and used vehicles across the country
i was going to pay cash for a new windshield
surprise there are not any reviews here
would recommend this place to everyone
as someone new to the jeeplife this was extremely helpful
get a second opinion and make sure mikes is not your second
they were very friendly and we felt like they cared about us and our situation
i followed advertising for a week on the 2015 rogue s  i even printed out a list of 6 vehicles listed at 18999 minutes before i left for the dealership
i highly recommend him
my friend and i looked to purchase a car from charlies
earlier when i was quoted 300 for the repair i explained i had 245 cash on me and no other way to pay
these guys are crazy they did my alignment 5 months ago and its wearing my tires already its a waste of money on this place dont go to this place please
the staff is usually very friendly here and almost always wishes you luck on the lottery
i payed them after everything was said and done over 2000
sometimes they are very good and the car i have requested is ready to go and easy to pick up and go
these folks are shady and they never let their unhappy customers rest
if you book a rental online expect more fees when you pick up the car
i will be recommending them to everyone i know
im so disgusted with this dealer i seriously cant come here again
i test drove the 2013 corolla and the 2013 matrix and decided on the corolla
we called and talked to someone else and they said they were really busy so they put us through to leave a 3rd message
it takes a little bit longer then other car washes but i know they will do a good job so its worth the wait
the office staff are all very friendly and the service is honest and reliable
getting my trade in was impossible apparently
i appreciated it
this is a big deal to me
jim is a no bs guy he will tell you upfront what is going on what the process to have your car fix
so the lady said i dont know go find the guy and come back once you finalize it
however when my transmission failed i took it to the service department
now the salesman i signed the contract with lied to me and he convinced me to pay extra 70 every month so i wont be responsible for anything he said that i am responsible only for the gas
now that ive bought the car i cant get the help i need
up sell starts with the line we have no compact or economy cars right not
we were happy with the service dept
no hard sell here
at first i was a bit shocked but hearing the flamboyant voice i assumed he batted for the other team
while i waited for my car i thoroughly enjoyed the parade of characters customers  friends who come and go
such a nice touch
the salesman claimed ignorance
i will be coming back as long as i can
i went to him considering a gently used car due to price but with the good incentives they had on a yearend model it made more sense to buy new
ridiculousand hence the ridicule i am now laying on them
went around the corner to another place of business and had my car inspected and it passed
he is a master at customer relations
a few weeks back i purchased a used quad from the craig location
this place is truly the diamond in the rough and is the first place i will go for repairs from now on
came in to get my plates they told me they would call me once they arrived shortly after they called i went to pick them up
4 no pushy sales pitches at another tire place i had to go through a 10 mn convo about which tire was bestwhy i should upgrade
the price for a lease is a bit rediculous considering my car windo was busted out when the garage was supposed to be gated and shut and no one seemed to know how in the world that could have happend
i saw the billboard advertisement and decided to google to see what auto glass places were near me auto glass express was first on the list
if youre interested in reading about my experience its there for you to read below
there is no detail as to what work was actually performed  just a price for the service requested
yep these dudes tried to pull a scam
i say but u sold me a part that didnt fit he said i dont care
damaged my car while attempting to drive up the ramp to perform an alignment on my car
9713 update i dropped my 2013 camaro off in the findlay chevrolet service department on july 18th for a routine 8000 mile service and then went on a business trip to washington dc while in dc i was hospitalized and did not return to las vegas until september 4th
i literally cannot feel more strongly than i do about how well this dealership took care of me during this situation
not to mention all the cold bottled sodas and beer
i will write a review everyday for the way i was treated from this company
i would recommend james to anyone looking for a car
just got back from a trip and using skyway park
what more could i ask for
took it to a nondealership shop and was told one hose was leaking at the clamp  and they repaired for 225 even the service writers work on commission there so they screw you out of everything
why would a car that is only a year old fail a smog check within one year right
from the front desk to the guys who were working on my car this place is great
from israels i was quoted 495 plus parts
staff is so gracious and kind
i had to give a star other than that it would be half
there was a coupon in the paper that oreillys would not honor because we could not find the exact type of oil my husband needed he asked if they would at least give him a discount of some kind if he got another brand
it took me months  and by that i mean almost a year  to get to the point emotionally and physically that i was ready for nellis to come in and start cataloguing
pascal was the best
i finally pulled my motorcycle out in may 2016 theyve had it for almost two years
use another car rental place
i got on yelp and found daves
we came here for lunch as a group of about 7 or 8 and got pretty good service
she said it wasnt and that the person on the card no long works here
he said the tires are cupped
they had went straight to crunching numbers
turns out you really dont there were streaks on both my windshield and rear window
this lack of attention was causing the poor performance that i had been experiencing
he came over and installed while i hungout inside my house with my kids
i recently had car troubles and needed my car towed into the shop
i guarantee you that kwicksilver wheel beat out any prices here in vegas i called around already  but dont take it from me find out yourself
upon service they noticed one tire was bad
i asked him who i needed to speak to about it he again stated that he was not the one who overcharged me
according to what was posted i could park
everyone there was very nice
luxury motorsports made a weak attempt at trying to doctor up the issue and my vehicle was in their shop for one day and this did not fix the problem to completion
i will never be going back
isnt that the standard at places like this
dont fall for it
i would literally go anywhere other than this shop
the way he was talking showed too much attitude and lack of respect for the customer
i got quoted 4999 for an oil change by kayla jenkins when i called to make the appointment then they told me 80 when i was being walked to the cashier gardy harding is the only nice person there he got the price reduced to 60 then i had to deal with a rude older hispanic lady at the cashier who refused to apply a 25 gift card this place had sent me in the mail she said i had to talk to the manager to get a gift card applied
i would walk and walk and walk
since then i have not heard anything from anyone at the dealership
german autotec in mesa rocks but german auto care in phoenix blows
thumbs up to ganley parma imports even after 2 years
i was only trying to gain an understanding of the product you try to sell
i went inside to check the place out
i get there and guy tells me his name is mr ed
car kept stalling and not good wasnt happy
postscript i had to go back because the bushings had been installed upside down
upon return a few hours later my car was ready and after some confusion as to who would give me my keys i got in my car and drove home
this is the third time ive been there and every time the service is slow and snotty
i had previously requested an inspection which they do for free any ways my service tech
he had not
it was ok a few years ago disappointing nowadays
i got in quicker than expected even though i showed up early and made sure they knew i was prepared to still only get in when i was scheduled
i cant wait to go back
very racist place refuse service because i am african american i was paying customer and they still refused me service very blunt and unapologetic about not wanting me to use the restroom because the color of my skin
they are deceitful liars and the gm should be fired for allowing this to happen and his poor handling of the situation
they seem very conscientious about helping out and were very creative in working out solutions to difficult situations
the location is definitely in a shady area but well worth the trip
have you noticed all the onestar ratings here are from women
both of these gentlemen would bring me back to buy another audi
after that she gave me the price for the repair and it was fairly affordable
i went in to service king after having my car hit in a parking lot
wheels were greasy greasy hand prints inside on glove box and on wheel
they called an hour later to nail down the costs and it was ready a couple hours later
ryan arrived on time he was courteous and professional
they also gave us a loaner car for the two days ours was in the shop
i have attempted to detail that thing before and it is a very daunting task
they came to my work and got my windshield replaced in a few hours
well after about 5 minutes i walked over to him and he said he would be right with me
when we first pulled up we were a little surprised by the restaurants appearance
i will go back
david politzer made the transaction seamless
big shout out to the guys at cycle tech nick  badger
they only would cover 1 labor hour one
we took a camry in for a minor repair and were amazed at how quick and capable this place was we will be back for all our body work
that being said no complaint about the service just charge too much
i got in an accident in january 2016 and my insurance geico had it go to brighton collison center
there are eight pumps from which to choose
they didnt touch the vehicle until 06222016 which we said was fine as it is a spare we are preparing to sell
i wish there were more ralphs in the world especially on a busy saturday morning
a pleasant experience overall
christian took care the chrome trimming of my subaru crosstrek and i was very satisfied
after taking all 3 of my cars there every year i will say no more
but since the sun is hanging out all day and trying to kill mei knew it was time
well while i was on the phone with her i noticed that on the checkout slip it says that the bypass hose was broken upon arrival
dont make the same same mistake i did
what more could you ask for
i sincerely hope a regional manager reads this bc i am going to make it a point to tell every dingle person i meet to avoid this store and the worthless manager
while this specific location made me rather upset if you dont agree with them i would ask for second opinions
shop claimed they needed to replace body control module bcm
he portrayed himself to be a manager
its no longer the economical option
thank you martin and adrian for all your help and going above and beyond in your customer service
after my previous review i was called by the store and told that it was the bearing that caused the problems not the cv boot
approximately one week later i drove it home
this is my go to car wash
its not only because i get a free cookie at paradise or that they are the closest to tucson
she spoke with you about the thanksgiving time
cabin air filter           58    vs 31 engine air filter          24    vs 15 fuel injection flush     140  vs 74 motor mount              152  vs 113 power steering line    264  vs 122 shop fee  taxes        70    vs 16 total                            843  vs 371  garys automotive was 56 cheaper than big two
i dropped the unit off and two weeks later they call to ask when i am bringing the unit in so they could make the repairs
maybe they dont respond because our 1st 4 oil changes are supposed to be free
second time they broke my lug nut while changing my tires
if you are looking for a particular type of car that they do not have in stock iautohaus will find it for you
worst experience ever
the guilty defendant was a nice individual but concluded to be a challenge
now the location of motorcycle tire center is not on the most richest of neighborhoods
he pointed out a brand new lexus and said this is what cars are supposed to look like
i am slightly mechanically inclined and still send my wife to brian due to his great work
and all of this from the comfort of my own home
she did not care one bit about my concern
again i know it is difficult to keep everything perfect but maybe this is to be expected
fast and easy
cheapest gas around need i say more
shuttle driver came by and left
however the crowds disgruntled workers with sour grapes expressions lines back into the socks in bulk section leads me feeling claustrophobic and equally sour grapes as the irascible lady checking me out
in order to get to work on monday
i was nervous about what a small dealership could do for financing but they actually had better rates than scottsdale porsche
as another customer said they are really honest and just a classy group of professionals
stay away from desert nissan and chris the sleazy sales manager
he just got here lmao but from what i gathered this free work they do all the time as a matter of course
costco is the best
he seemed totally fine with that and was happy to let us test drive until our heart was content
no problem but to bring back at 14 tank and if its over that thanks
drive to the north scottsdale location if you can
outstanding customer service great drive through wash free vacuums
solid visits since my original 331 visit and i am happy about the consistent service i receive here
definitely have already referred my friends  and family to come see him when in need of buying a car
they will take every opportunity to deceive you  create problems with your vehicle in order to steal your hard earned money
they have to hire security guard sometimes because so much goes down
and even if it wasnt
polite and friendly personnel who honor a contract
towbin prestige is awesome
i like the vacuums more than i like their car wash and i especially love the machine that takes in your floor mats and cleans them pretty good
so normally i dont write reviews if they are unfavorable but i feel the need on this one
maybe im a princess but nothing makes me happier to know that after hours and hours and hours of travelling i will come to a car that is not snowed in and ice cold
they said i could wait it was only going to be an hour
they made my 2016 prius look amazing and helped block this hot vegas weather
service was amazing the guys explained what needed to be done and had the car fixed up within ten minutes of arriving
would recommend them to anyone needing all types of work from an oil change to the worst possible thing
2nd strike firestone could complete the work for less than 500 and the service tech said even they overcharge
wasted my gas and my time for them to be out of four advertised things
finally returned to me with oil change free car was and no gas fillup
thumbs down all around
he got right back with the specified auto available
i mean just great customer service
however the burger and fries were cold
worst car dealership ever
that was our second trip
ill be here again next time
hats of to harley and themthanks a bunchmichael sievers
he was more than happy to listen to my story concerns and my frustration
they were friendly and fast and with zero dollars spent who could ask for more
this was at least 50 due to not wanting to deal with this dealership or nissan anymore
we were worried that this restaurant wouldnt live up to the hype but it did
told me no way my loan would process with out him because my score was too low which he lied about and told me it was 40points lower than it really was then told me the warranty can not be taken off but will give it to me at half price
thanks again lance
they know what theyre doing and takes the time to make sure it performs the way it should and lets you know about what they did to your vehicle
from the time of the call to the technician arriving and unlocking the vehicle was only 15 minutes
i booked online through kayakcom and got the best deal available their office isnt  at the airport but they picked me up quickly and boom i was in their office
she spoke to a woman named tatiana and she was kind at first
we moved onto finance with andre who was also very personable knowledgeable and good at his job
i will fix my headliner your 25 star overall speaks for itself
my jeep was hit in a parking lot as i was waiting to get in it
i have been a customer here since 2008 although ownership of the dealer did change hands two years ago from billco motors to cochran and have always gotten very good service with my vws
i have never in my life experienced such quality service and genuine interest
he corrected himself and said that there would not be a manager there at 4 again deceptive
i tinted my 2012 mazda 3 with charcoal 23 tint all around at audio heaven
but ever since they got the new manager its gone down hill
anyway i had extra time at lunch near where i work and a colleague had told me to try peoria vw
awesome experience today
if you want a cheap price expect a cheap job
highly recommended if care about your car time stereo and money
other than ive urged them to reconsider participating in the program but they just wont change their minds
this is our brand new vehicle and now it will start to rust with every car wash and rain storm until fixed
i took it in the week prior for an estimate
for 8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website the folks at sky harbor parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time and ive used them a handful of times solo and with the bf so i know its doortodoor consistent service
its 1016 am they just opened the check out lines are long elderly people scrambling to find a place to stand in a busy unorganized costco mess seriously management must awaken to a better effective way to care for their patrons
stay away stay far far away
they got me in at the last minute and had the car ready to go by the time that i requested before actually despite the fact that they had to do a bunch of extra work that we hadnt anticipated
the shoppers here are aweful
they still offer uhaul rentals
since i didnt want to deal with her attitude i grabbed the redbulls and told her never mind and left
i asked him if he was sure of the quote because i didnt want any surprises
i got there around 4 they close at 530 and explained the situation and pointed out a few paint issues they missed
want i got was the shaft the car went in for the oil change which took about 25 minutes but then it came out and wentback into the line for vacuuming
the curry was tasty but we were full by then
in fact im thinking of making a pilgrimage to vegas just to have them service my jeep
believe they produce the c e and slk classes here as well as some of the more specialized series
this time no people and no cars
we were the only riders without experience
unfortunately i have a rudimentary knowledge of the phledging digital dashboard camera market
i contacted them right away and they asked me to bring it in
a spacer lift changes the geometry of the suspension in a way that the vehicle can no longer be aligned to factory specs
this is my third time coming here to fix a crack on my windshield
thats why respect
stop talking and gossiping open another register and move the line along
and then the service is fantastic
that i could blow my engine at the next stop light
however they manage to keep it maintained and fixed it at their own expense
there are signs asking patrons to limit use to 10 minutes or less during busy hours but there are enough baysvacuums where im sure there is rarely an issue
but it was very affordable and to my surprise he even went and had it smogged for me which is why this whole journey started in the first place
quality quality quality
for 23 bucks you get 23 scoops
im curious if perhaps we received the wrong order as there wasnt really any noticeable black pepper
this is the place you want to go
friendly staff that cater to your valuable time
eric went above and beyond taking care of everything related to my experience
it is a slap in the face to knowingly require something that the person doesnt have as a condition of reimbursement
little pricy comparatively  but worth it for the in and out service
this is a place that will take you for everything you have if you are in a hard place
when i told him i had enough credit cards he rolled his eyes
they told me even though i had the expired permit i had to bring utility bills and proof of ownership just like getting a permit for the first time
so they didnt even follow up on that
the service is spot on
meanwhile you get to sit at the place you originally rented it from where you get dumb looks and that well have to see what the manager can do tomorrow
thanks jiffy lube
no cost to me as i have full coverage
the bearing on my drive shaft broke while i was driving and they were able to fix it  and fix it fast and cheap
he walked me to an office with 2 guys and i kid you notone of them was eating an ice cream cone with his feet up on the desk
not a happy sams club shopper
i took it to the dealer who said sorry they put in a very weak systema recall should have been placed but sadly the general manager of the service department sadi its nothing i can help after i explained the fact that my son had breathing problems and the heat left him exhaustedaverage temp in july and august 100 or bettercan anyone with good lungs handle thatno is the answer
if they want to make it mandatory at the very least treat their customers better
all the owner did was give me excuses instead of being a professional
not for that day not for the day before not even for any day in the future it was bizarre
nothing impresses me about a honda
lesson learned here
if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to share them with us at wwwgrouponcomsupport
but heave forbid you actually want to buy something
i spent 41536 and got nothing for my money
the rear end of the car is perfect
my salespersin mike had just started selling cars which was totally okay because he wasnt pushy at all
for someone who knows nothing about custom cars that someone being
he treated it like it was an art project detailing every single crevice
im sitting here now while my car is vacuumed for a second time because there was literally dirt still on the floor and seats
in spite of several requests for him to do a little better on the price he said he wouldnt until we came up on our offer
its getting old and keenan and randy always make time to listen to me and take a look at what code those pesky lights on the dash mean and explain it to me as well
if you need your vehicle fixed give this place a shot
sal was my salesperson and although hes embarrassed at the yelp shoutouts he was great to deal with
clean facility
2220 w horizon ridge pkwy henderson nv 89052   isaac with a large sanctificado tattoo on his left arm said they can repair the tire for 20 but can only accept cash as their credit card machine was out of order
then you get a bottle of water for each person as you leave
however this is not a female friendly dealership
once i get in the car it drives 20 times worse than when i brought it in
since then they have moved and expanded which im really happy for
between the paint and repairs my car was back in less than a week and i had a brand new car
very fast service    wouid recommend him to anyone
there are lines of valet parking drivers all in tuxedo
i would write a better review but i dont want people going hear cause there that good
he answered all of my questions and made sure i knew how to use my new purchase
im coming in next week to get the 4th tire and warranty because i will be bring in my car here for all my tire needs
i could barely brake
you have to hold the pump the entire time
so you have to do a prepaid amount of money inside the station desk which means that unless you dont want to do a full fuel tank you will pay more money that fuel you will put in your car
if fred were an honest man this shuttle he says they have would have handled the rides to and from
their waiting area is pimped out with over sized leather chairs lots of reading material and free wifi holla
not only did they lose a sale but a potential life long customer as well
now normally i would replace the brakes my self but i am getting married next week and i dont have time
they do not have equal or slpenda available at the coffee area
thank for all the great service mario
clearly this place doesnt want or need business if they can just let people stand around and wait to not be helped
okthose made absolute sense
she is an exemplary person  charming warm polite and courteous
my wife and i dont feel pressured with upsells and have actually been told services requested werent needed from time to time
keep up the great attitude
and she went to grab a salesperson for me when i asked her too
they were very professional and knowledgeable they promised me the truck to be done by a certain time and day and not only was it done it looks awesome
eva is awesome
i liked the idea of buying a kia because it had that 10 year warranty
i had a massive dent in one of my chrome wheels from a really bad pot hole
3 to start and then 1 increments for additional time
there is a sea of difference between acura and this lexus dealership in customer service
there has to be an alternative
when we showed up jeff was our guy to help
greg o contacted me within the hour for my quote ended up doing an amazing job on both my headlights  interior and exterior for the same price as i had been quoted elsewhere for just the detailing
its easy to see how john has stayed in business for 6 years when most of the other tint shops last less than 2  he runs a service business with an eye towards service and treats all his customers with respect  which is more than i can say for most other aftermarket car guys
i ended up declining the shop car and found rides
i went there the other night with my fatherinlaw and husband
long story short i spent 2 and a half hours at the dealership speaking with dale test driving a car and waiting on dale to figure out options before i was presented with an offer for the dealership to buy me out of my lease and tack on a new car payment for 200 more than my current lease payment
i let him know as a manager he is responsible for making things right on behalf of the company
i saw them working working on motorcycles 4 wheel atvs cars trucks
it might not sound like much but a little interest goes a long way in my book
i was told this would be completed monday april 10  as of 430pm tuesday april 11  no call from carmax
the inside looks fine
you should just have an automated message that says im sorry because thats what it felt like talking to you
gregs hours greg understands todays busy person
we had to point this out to them as they sure didnt mention it during talk about the car
i usually drop off my car the night before and they have it done by the end of the next day
a list was made and they gave me a price
i know i know shouldve been a sign hindsight
there were maybe two food stains on the backseat that would easily come out with just shampoo
is that really how u guys talk to a repeating customer
older customer service man refused to help me with a check engine light said he could hook up the car and read the codes but would charge me 8999 to look them up and tell me whats actually wrong
i only gave two stars because of the glass guy matt or mike or something like that he fixed a couple of little dings in my nieces window free of charge
this place is deceivingly huge and accommodates a good amount of people though there is still a wait time for us it was only about 25 min for a party of 4
i will be back
i hope this review reaches out to everyone before going to this dump
ive been here for regular washes and details their work is always thorough
friendly professional and honest
2 pad thai  very good but the noodles are skinnier than your traditional pad thai
instead of taking any ownership for the problem he convinced me i needed 2 hoses for the power steering pump and charged 203 for two basic hoses
this was our first time buying a true luxury brand automobile and i was very impressed
i have been giving brian my business for over many years now since my first car
so you can probably understand how upset i was when the truck again failed for not ready sensors
the last time my g friend took her truck in for brakes they noticed she had a bad tire oscar went to discount and found a used one and charged her nothing for it
i highly recommend cinemagic
each customer transaction by my count is about 1015 minutes
the manager patrick is so rude he doesnt care about his job quite obviously
my cousins husband matt showed us this place
then this guy told me that there were exceptions he pointed one on the coupon which read  not valid for select vehiclesmodels or modified vehicles call merchant for questions
i will definitely see them in 4k miles to stock up on motul engine oil if i do not get lazy and go to walmart for rotella
however all these places say this even the ones that charge less
if you need tires you really need to call and get a price quote
i took the money order and left
they do sell chicken which ive only tried just one time in two years coming here
ian burrows made this the most simple car buying ever
one of your locksmiths james came over to my place
never a long wait when coming home no matter what time of day or night
the staff is always super friendly and i love that i can drive over on my lunch break to get a quick car wash and vacuum out my car so i can keep it pristine
even these basic issues their inspection couldnt catch when they handed over the vehicle
upon arrival the shop looks new and inside lobby is comfortable
seriously a charge for using an debit card
the convenience of 1 selecting my own car and driving off and 2 being able to drop the car and leave upon return to the airport is a great convenience
scheduled me quick and fixed a issue with my car and did not even charge me for this
i pointed it out to him  he said oh yeah  let me try this again
would not recommend and very disappointed in their inability to call me
ive been bringing my 2004 330ci to sw bimmers for about two years now and even though i live about 35 miles away i wouldnt go anywhere else under any circumstances
service plazas are my favorite stops when im road tripping
since it was so unexpected i was going in for a used car but trish and the team managed to get me in a  new 2015 honda civic  oh and of course i got to ring the big bell
sharon happened to be the person to help me after she helped another gentleman with his battery
if you need new tires i would recommend discount tire
saying the dealership was closed and we had to leave the premises
ive been dealing with this repair shop for over 5 years
he is based in the west valley and now that he is super busy he doesnt make it over to the east valley as muchi get that i hate driving across the valley too eric or sometimes his brother have tinted 4 or 5 vehicles for me and have always done a stellar job
minimum amount is done for the  1999 wash   seats were not wiped down no armor all done or rain ex for that price
called by the gm
there was a laundry list of maintenance performed and most charges seemed reasonable
mike and everyone one who works here are extraordinary
i liked the way i was treated as well as the way they were treating the other customers in the waiting room
the cool shoes
since i was pressed for time moving is pretty damn stressful i accepted but only because i had no other option
i was told the i was going to get a engine rebuild instead they said they fixed other issues
did a lot of research
he did call to let me know that but since i was at work i couldnt shuffle my schedule to accommodate
i bring my car back the next day and they call me about 4 hours later notifying me that they were all done
i had this curry better somewhere else
if you want to take your car and let inexperienced so called auto techs work on it take your car in to this place
bought a groupon
every time i am blown away by how great of a wash i can get for 10
just youre stereotypical mechanics trying to scam you with anything
i called the decatur uhaul and explained my son would be returning the truck on my behalf
i called my insurance company for roadside assistance and they assigned this company gave me an eta and a phone number
my appointment was wonderful and kevin makes sure to answer all my questions
great shop honest people
it was 150 bucks out the door
got stuck in the middle of the dessert and the group just continued on and left me in the blazing heat
i called again at 445 pm and they said it would take an hour
i stopped in today the service was friendly
fortunately no dent
the issue was they were trying to get us into a new car after i told them preowned would be better for us
the service manager leanne who helped me was fantastic
guess what happened
they were super nice and always offered me drinks when i came in to make sure i was comfortable
thanks drive time
i wish however they would offer rentals due to service wait time but the shuttle gentleman is an old school gentleman with ettiqutte and respectful hospitality
its great having a garage i can trust for my much loved subaru
lots of broken promises and incompetence at both locations
free paper and coffee were always welcome
if i could put  5 stars i would
that may not seem like a lot but it surely adds up over the term of the lease
alex listens to you and goes to work on the issue
i think this is the second car ive brought to them that they said i needed a special alignment that would equate to 370
i hinted on the phone to her that i cant find a ride to the dealer at this moment and she doesnt care
from autozone next door it cost 14 bucks for 25 gallons
the estimate process was painless
i looked up 10 places and wanted to find somewhere that would vacuum and give my dash cup holders and other problematic areas some much needed tlc for under 50
he made it into what was a great albeit longlasting experience
nacho did good work really reasonable price and did it for what he quoted
this was my top worst experience with a business
seriously go see codyhes awesome and will do whatever he can for you
he even keeps the parts he replaced to show you what the issue was and gives you a side by side of the new part
thank you louis for the fast service
the lousy manager could have at least asked me to bring the truck by so we could look at it together
it has only be 24 hours at this time but i have at least walked away feeling good about my decisionnot dreading or regretting it
i purchased my car toyota rav4 from a family member that had bought the car new and had every service call done at rohrich with no problems
fyi the henderson lexus is owned by the same people and they were also very poor and made many inappropriate comments to me in the past
i meet the guy to pick up my atv i ask if he would mind helping me load it in my truck no problem on the phone get there and the guy says  how you going to get it in the truck
and mean while this weird guy was like we will make sure you leave here happy because youre a lady
looks really nice again
i walked into the hyundai dealership with the idea that i was only going to test drive a tuscon
great service and work
when we bought the car kris handled all the financial aspects and he was great as well
i called to have an estimate on wooden shutters for my new home
oh and for some reason every time i get a fountain drink from them its a different price with the same size i get
i would refer all my friends and family here for car work
super awesome service
that turns alot of people away and you will lose costumers that way
these guys are terrific
chase and his crew are great
they took forever to give us the keys even though we had an online reservation
do not under any circumstance bring your car here
wish i could give zero stars
rating the sales dept i called to inquire if a car on their website was still available because i had a bit of a drive to get to their location
i needed a plug recently and they did it for free
7th place i went shopping for a car well worth the drive
this is the best auto body shop around
first visit to superior tire
my tires were absolutely fine when i drove in to tbw
worst i have ever seen
took the car back a year later after it was unsellable after a deployed airbag they hid
i returned the car and got my deposit back
i get his voicemail every time i call as he never answers the phone
only time will tell
my car was there for 6 weeks major repair and it would have been nice to receive periodic updates without me having to initiate the contact
appointments dont mean much here
when i arrived i stepped out of my jeep and was greeted by a service person who asked if i had an appointment
seriously dont hesitate to call scott
the adhesive was applied in lumps inconsistently and the new skin was so tight it malformed the base material effectively ruining the headliner
fixed my truck in the time quoted
i dealt with linda seamans and i will continue to do so
another yelp success story spent a silly amount of time trying to figure out my new car shop
i had my own financing but during the process bell honda offered me honda financing which i decided to go with
1 stars  do yourself a favor and do not patronize this business
but even worse was the finance guy
no matter how many times i went to the wash closest to me a jacksons and practically begged them for attention to detail i never got it
fantastic buying experience
terrible shuttle service pretty good service department work
when i went to pick up my rig i found that not to be the case
i love honda  its close to my house but im one mishap from finding a new dealership
the lobby is updated cozy clean and welcoming
although it is possible to get a good deal from them you cannot trust the salesmen which is obviously fairly important in buying a car
i called on sunday to set an appointment for an inspection
i am very displeased at the gas pump set up at south decatur and the 215 beltway
i want to thank the entire staff on our transaction
ive had it for a week now
id never talk to one of my customers like that
check engine light on damn it not again
i havent used da kine yet and it doesnt look im going to be able to
although these guys love to work on high performance racers and conversions they do the regular stuff as well
i was told the job would take two hours and they had it done in fifty minutes
selection is great love my car just wish that the details after the sale were as important as the details during the sale
i will go to him when i need to sell my next car
met him at the tent sale at the orleans
gave my lancer evo gsr for 6000 miles service
i leased an acadia from autonation
its unfortunate they had a car i actually had an interest in buying but the attitude just put me off entirely
with traffic and everything else it made it impossible for me to go home meet with family get dressed and take 1 car
so i asked just to have a light checked
reply to dylans comment what the hell does that mean
the refrigerator was nice though
i got the feeling he could not care less
wanted to help out a local business
i cant recommend them highly enough
like any auto shop it can sometimes be a hit and a miss however i always feel comfortable bringing my cars here for substantial work or maintenance
they were going to charge me 10 for replacing some screws on my fender but they waived the fee
this review is regarding the service of tj one of the sales associates
big respect to the kindness given from what most people look at as a profession that just rips you off
their waiting area was comfortable and quiet and from the waiting area i was able to watch my car get repaired
i recommend this shop to everyone and anyone
thanks to hln for a very satisfying buying experience
this weekend i visited audi north scottsdale to take a look at and buy a 2015 audi s6
just for signing up you save 03 cents
i dont know the first thing about cars but they take the time to show me and tell me what we are looking at under the hood
make sure you review your paperwork very closely before you sign anything
i am not a repeat customer and drive an a3  and am ok with the service but in the showroom you see they pay more attention to their repeat buyers  im just sayin
i will refer anyone i know that is looking for a car to audi henderson
when i got there the tech steve even sounded skeptical about the outcome of my rear bumper
the service is fast polite and professional
the owner even met me at the shop to receive my car on a sunday they are closed sundays and took the time to show me the bad parts they had pulled off the car and explain how things work
didnt wash my car properly didnt vacuum inside
easy to speak with great job
if i ever have to get my windshield replaced again hopefully not ts will be the only company i will call
came here with my parents during a trip to las vegas
be careful it can get a little backed up on the weekends but well worth the wait
being my husband was not available to look and i have to get the kids from daycare immediately after work the weekend was my only saving grace
sunday morning when i looked at the car i noticed the extra beef on my tires and found out i was given wrong size tires 1956515 cars original tire size is 1956015
not the end of the story yet folks
theyll make it worthwhile
ultimately i ended up doing business with them and couldnt be happier with my new vehicle
ive been using chapman for service ever since i purchased my new pt there in 2005  once in a while i worry that i should be going elsewhere like this week
they are always fast courteous and knowledgeable and their customer service is top notch
brought my 72 442 to elliotts
paint was not great the first time i got my car back after 4 days at their shop but they did tell me to bring it back and they would take care of it
customer service is horrible
i love cilantro but it was a little overwhelming for me too
the owner called me a few hours later to follow up
when there are customers they are pissed off at the crap customer service they are receiving or being apologized to by managers
after hearing about this restaurant on the internet i made a note that we had to go there while in vegas for the sema show
i was a little thrown off by the self vacuuming but got over it
the staff members here were incredibly polite extremely prompt and went out of their way to take care of us since we were getting it done on a rental car
i would recommend you going to see them if youre interested in buying a new or used car
ken came back and told me what the issues were and patiently explained every last detail to me and what the costs associated would be
we also got some weird song and dance from the sales manager about it being busy blah blah blah
came to an agreement for the 60 month loan and was told the documents would be ready the following day
i was told that the brakes just passed inspection and that i should think about getting them replaced
the younger woman assisted me and was very nice
there were deals all over the lot and the selection of high end cars was amazing
i brought my volvo into tanner based on the yelp reviews and i wish i never had
thanks vince again see u in 6 months for the oil change
so once again a reminder is in order
probably your average place to get a car wash they try to sell you but they wont push it like the jack off pit bulls at dannys on raintree
i wait until today  after an other hundred times call  after uncountable voice messages left   i still cant hear nothing from them
i know nexttonothing about cars
no i wont write any of that heres what i will write  toms thumb is an eatery that needs to get a clue
the instrument panel was clear as a bell
but i recommend that for any important or expensive thing
20 mins later she called my name
seth and mike were awesome and friendly
if you are drving outside the las vegas strip heading toward the airport youll see this cheveron located on the right side just after passing the welcome to las vegas sign
the staff was super helpful navigating me through buying a car for the first time as a self employed person
everything here is authentic and pure
they want to fix your car and they will if you let them so let them
ive been here an hour so far and have received nothing but an attitude
i wont take my car anywhere else for service and as long as i own a honda they will be my service shop
checked us in fast but had to wait for a car to be delivered overall not bad though not great either
we especially would like to thank jake for excellent customer service
i dropped my car off for them to diagnose some problems i was having
this place is very nice
we got a pretty nice car
best part is after my brother agreed to get this car he gets a call from the salesperson who again asked if he wanted to try to get a mazda 6 and my brother pretty much got to tell him he got the car he wanted
she was a big help ordering our car and helping us through the entire process
checked with 2 other repair shops for a check engine light
he even looked over my warranty and informed me i could get this issue covered with the dealership
afterall when you get your car back you want your car looking as if nothing ever happened
my van has 178k on it
they are always nice to me and try to explain whats going on with my car as well as present me with options for repair
this is not the only poor experience ive had with south blvd parts dept
they failed to pick me up in the morning
shortly after i took my car to griffins auto to get their opinion and the rep told me it was an urgent repair that would cost 300 or more
even after that i still had air in the system
i was given an estimate and my car was fixed at the estimated price given
very satisfied with the outcome only hitch is that the slot where i went at the vacuum and blower station was heavily drenched with water from previous uses
thanks guys for making what could have been a disaster into a great success
let me know what was going on the whole time
the one time i had my vehicle detailed they broke my hood release and i had to argue with the gm because he said his folks would have told him they broke it
to top it off once your car is finished they come in the waiting room and  yell out the make and model of your car you then go outside to complete disorganization and chaos i had to maneuver my car out between the other cars then was directed to out the side of the building very narrow in order to get out of there
i felt very strange here
he then wanted me to show proof of the deal on true car
the guy was clearly giving us the roof and attempting to scrape us down
same result as the past year
ill never forget these words i rented you a car you didnt sell me your life
they said they didnt  touch it and it was a coincidence that it stopped working while it was at their shop
they shouldve said upfront that it was going to cost 140 we wouldve said no
i can trust him to give me the facts about my car
i would never go to the dealer for service unless it was warranty
i then checked the oil and saw it was extremely low
justin jt and ron at discount tire over at the pavilions are great
discount tire continues to provide some of the best customer service out there
michelle at the front took care of everything i needed
lie 3  he becomes rude and asks me how i think they are supposed to take a dent out of plastic
anyrate i took the mix n match package and handed over the keys
i am going to report fraud to my credit card company dmv and my insurance company
never renting for you again
i got my car back clean looking perfect and they really went over and above to treat me like  vip
the company refunded me the cost to repair my automobile quickly 2 business days and without hassle
this is type of  trick my kids used to pull when they were six
they found a few concerns but howard explained to me what was needed without trying to scare me into forking over loads of money for these repairs
my porsche 911 carrera 4s has never looked better than when i bring it to ecowash the staff especially chubbs has always treated me like im a priceless client
only 2 stars cause the oil change is only 1380 total
and thats when it began
i called they had all 4 tires in stock
they said they did not see my car they would call me back when they found it
theyll probably be on the wednesday truck
worst experience ive ever had buying a car
i drive a 2009 nissan and took in for oil change and was recommended to do scheduled maintenance for 350  i declined  as a single parent  live by paycheck and will have to save for this
we ordered the nam kao tod garlic prawns crispy duck panang curry and softshell crab drunken noodles
took my car in on 91712 they put my sealed container of antifreeze horizontal on my back seat which is leather
the service department was full of unhappy customers
yes they have vacuums to use but thats not all
the cafe was ok but they loose a star for the coffee which tasted terrible and took them way too long to make
go to courtesy buick on sahara if u have a hummer to service
i do not want any american cars and of the foreign cars the only thing i do not want is a kia
i feel sorry for them working for this man
they have 5 customers or more requesting service in the am and maybe 2 techs
the technician who came to our house on a half days notice was absolutely fantastic
the customer service was top notch as well as their quality of work
i was tempted to try to convince him to take some money but thought better of it left
my salesman said bring the cover sheet for the insurance and sign a couple more papers and ur good to go
i brought it in on friday at 715am and i am working with jason
i my family my friends and my associates will never buy a car here
especially if you come across sales manager nick larma andor frank
it drove me crazy
i did not think it was so easy and id get a car
if you are having issues with your volvo then bring it in to marshall
heard about this place from the food channel and finally tried the place
i was in the market for a 2016 honda fit and had been corresponding online with a sales rep touching base on availability etc
i didnt use it but i understand that they offer a shuttle service
this establishment is unprofessional and operates on a sub par basis
recently he did some brake work for me
very friendly great prices and exceptional service
the asking price was 27000 for an 08 mustang
i went to gios automotive in march to get a tire rotation and oil change with inspection back in march
again it wasnt too expensive to fix
the toshiba died after 3 months of use and the dell died after barely 5 months of use
truly authentic thai food in a place you would never expect
the bluetooth was supposed to work but found out it didnt after i purchased the car
i dropped the vehicle off before they opened in the morning
it was fabulous
just blamed me for not driving off the lot with it the same day
i pulled in and noticed that they charge 10 cents per gallon more for debit and credit vs cash on gas
service dept is a fucking joke
we went inside and i was told that they would have an estimate monday and i could leave it till then
missed a few spots and it was so obvious since the rest was so shiny and greased
the place does attract the usual types of people but if you dont mind a little crazy its a good place to get your tims fix
the car wash guy did a good job and i tipped him well
i was not disappointed
their blend of chilisherbsspices blend were unreal
im amazed at the transformation of this place
i seriously hope you are a horrible inhumane company with the rudest black people with attitude answering the phones
car wash which was the best they offer before going into the detailing category
he called me back and spoke with me in detail during what was evidently a busy morning about the issue i was having and ultimately recommended another shop for the diagnosis
this place is crazy busy
he says they will look and call back
this is a small enterprise and does not have an office staff so they may be slow responding to emails
so i figure ill go try another place just to see if its a legit reason
currently staring at a large group of tourists stocking up on toiletries so also good for when youve forgotten something on your road trip
all i can say is that they quoted us a price of 76500 for the replacement of two battery cables and a new battery
needless to say i dont really trust most automotive centers at the dealerships  or chains in general especially the nissan dealership and pepboys in town
i just purchased a brand new 2015 porsche cayenne turbo and am delighted by my experience at porsche north scottsdale especially with my salesman mark siffert
they always have reasonable prices
i was able to get everything i needed out  was escorted off of the property
i hate driving a uhaul so much until today i was able to avoid it
kept hitting all the wrong controls
they will be tenacious and will not let you leave the foyer where there will be different sexy new models on display
i found this place because my bmw had a bad battery in the frys parking lot and there shop is right there
offers were printed and included all of the relevant information sales prices taxes fees tradein value and several financing scenarios
debating my options here
not to mentions the wine room is beautiful
they were more concerned with the customer reviews than doing what is right and selling cars
i would highly recommend this place
when she went to fix the car she brought me back my old brakes and said i may be able to get the money back for them because they wore down defectively
we have to take our vehicle in to have the ac checked again
i would recommend this place to anyone if theyre looking for quality service for a reasonable price
seat was offing 49 alinm so we already new we we going the for that
i would highly recommend this shop
i dont know why it shows this business as closed on yelp i assure you they open and ready to take care of your needs
always gets my car clean very fast and a fair price
all the darn cashier would say is  it wouldnt work because you put it in too many times and it is a security check
mine didnt but they issued a credit on return
the items they need to attend to with my car are minor and not costly just require follow up and some inexpensive parts
after 40 minutes i went to check on it he was out there doing it himself
it of course passed and my 10 year old car runs better than ever
before i even left the first time i had to go back in after seeing my car because they did not put the tires on the correct way
they told me all the bays on the opposite side of the garage were full  i would have to come back tomorrow because my car was too low for the bays on the side i was already parked in getting my headlight changed
the gas pumps were all suddenly broken and they werent doing anything to actively fix it
so friggin cool
there are places to get food and drinkits located in a strip mall lot and an emcee plays classic rock
i normalky dislike the home process but i have to give all the findlay honda in henderson 10
employees were not friendly and overall not helpful
it took them about 15 minutes including the test drive up the street which was to check my steering wheel
i met josh johnson during a service  call for my civic and we started talking about new cars
i cannot say enough good things about these two gentleman
this was the easiest and most friendly process we have ever had renting a car and the fastest
came back and said absolutely not we agreed to these terms and gave back the vehicle and got my tradein back
went to buy a 2nd vehicle and the sales person louis evans was very helpful
all of the pumps in working order
now i understand that this is standard but my issue is with the irritating financial guy
i decided to check inside and only 1 person and he looked like was on break having drink
finally ive got all three
this was the second car we have purchased from acura of peoria and we will definitley be back
knowing that its done right the first time is my peace of mind
and yes i am a nittygritty kind of guy who wants to know and nail down all the details to get it preciously how i want
again there was some negotiating and we always left disappointed but they were able to come down and meet us where we needed to be
i went back and was asked if i had a punch card and i did not so the manager at the time looked it up in the computer and found my info and saw i had two remaining
it beats any other gas station close by
best in nlv
pricing is completely above board and the treatment is annual
they are professional quick and thorough
was given 5 different completion dates with little communication of what was going on
i spoke with their sales manager and told him that i needed to leave the next day on a business trip out of town
i have struggled with finding someone capable other than the stealer to service my rover
the tire rotation wasnt even done on a lift
last night jose called and made an appointment for my son to see it today at 11 jose texted my son at 8am this morning to confirm
my car was in desperate need of a bumper repair due to someone hitting me in a parking lot
everyone there is super nice and my car came back to me nice and clean and serviced for its 20000 miles check up
it cost me 95 dollars  wtf is this hit
we make much better pad thai at home lol
update  i spoke with the vp of greulich and he mailed me a check to reimburse the remainder of the diagnostic fee that i had been charged
not like your local pretty good thai establishment this place serves authentic thai food
their waiting area is nice and i played some pac man galaga donkey kong and frogger on their table top arcade game
i couldnt insure the car i wanted to purchase and expected them to understand that im not able to purchase the car anymore but they just avoided me for weeks after calling and leaving them voicemails after voicemails
i was looking for a new used 2011 ford explorer and i was being picky
i decided to visit the next day with the intention of test driving a few ford fusions but i ending up purchasing
bought the groupon last month
in a sketchy area with a warning on the door that theyve had a lot of car break ins
ever try to get a title out of a safety deposit box on a saturday afternoon
i went here a few years ago service was horrible
this entire time i had to make the effort to call and call because no one would return my messages or follow up with me to explain what was going on with my vehicle
i knew it would be a matter of time before the cracks spread
so cheap and also a very pleasant experience
i love that the gas area is always clean too
fair honest straightforward best prices wont suggest something you dont needthats all you really need to know but i have been going to az auto doctor since i started driving in 1995  this place is the best shop hands down
i was able to drop it off and they offered to take me back to work and pick me up when my car was ready
apparently if you order an 8 they cook the dish with habaneros then they were supposed to take it out
thats fine and well but this place is still a rip off and im honestly confused as to why anyone would buy a car here
first come first served my ass
as i walked out of the store livid with fury even the other customers in the waiting area looked at me and then to the manager in disbelief
10 min later tried to turn it on and no start
i let them know and was told no problem just bring the car in which i did
its with extreme displeasure that i write this review
they kept insisting we work with one of the other gentelman
second this guy joseph whos in his late 20searly 30s would use oldschool high pressure sales tactics as if he was hellbent on closing the deal right there and then
324 pm in the afternoon
fast and efficient business approach they are not about wasting your time
these events were spread apart by over a year
its gone downhill from when they opened
the salesman that set up the sale was totally incompetent
van was a piece of junk
i would have been happy with competent people and a secure location but the free cookie at paradise was a nice extra touch
i would and do recommend this location to everyone i know looking for professional service
that seemed a little shady so it gave us pause but we thought we would address that once the car arrived if necessary
my advice to all of you looking to get autocare in the neighborhood definitely do your research
they were addressed with no questions asked
i came in without a referral and left with amazing hair and what felt like a horde of new friends
while waiting for parts i was kept up to speed as to the status
a behind the scenes tour of their facility by justin their gm and a closer look video of a few of their models with komeko one of their sales guys
i agree worst customer service ever
bought my mustang new in 11 and the experience was so good that i think a review is warranted
the driver asked what we were going to do with the vehicle and my son explained he would scrap it out and sell it for 300
shes awesome and im so glad i didnt get jipped
right off the back he asked what brought us in we told and the experience from there on was the most remarkable i have ever had in customer service
if they are getting something that is locked up and you ask for the same product or the product next to it they will tell you to go wait in line instead of doing customer service and saving themselves and others time
went back in bc of the 10 year warranty apparently there was some other leak they hadnt noticed before and refuse to give me any compensation or refund or anything without paying more
hop back in my tl and visit kawika at island auto service right down the street mere blocks away
years later i think they cleaned house a bit and got back on thier feet
i will be returning and i will tell my friends and family about moe and elite audio
whenever im in town they will wash my rides
always great service here
now this wasnt just a standard service there were a couple of recalls but thats still ridiculous
to prove how amazing the customer service was this is my first yelp review and i drove 30 minutes to see her 3 times when theres a jeep dealership 2 minutes from me
i explain again about the missing chrome on the wheel and that i am very aware of the position of that wheel on my truck due to the fact the chrome is peeling etc the tech then goes on to tell me how he rotated the tires i explain again that is impossible again due to the unique wheel with missing chrome
a plus imho
after the 45 minute wait which was explained beforehand my car was presented back to me with the following  multiple large spots of untouched wax still over the car
she was more than willing to help me she looked at my trailer issues via pictures explained the process of appointments drop off and approx the time the unit would be down
cannot say anything bad about customer service or service reps  they are all nice and helpful
it turned out to be the oil pan for 290
anyone could have marched over and took things out
thank you for the great deal and nice experience
remember how people used to say that you couldnt operate certain types of businesses without employing undocumented illegal workers
she asked how the weather was
alex haq you are the complete opposite of a professional
so ive been here many times but today i popped in for hot chocolate
my family since dealing with mark have never feared his estimate on the repair we may not like the price but we never doubt mark is honest and fair with us
what a place
i did get an excellent deal on the car i wanted
truly it is not a modern sparkling car washbut who cares
thank you fred
im a neat freak so i like my car looking as nice as possible
he explains everything thoroughly
instead he starts telling me to use my brain and let his ego get the best of him
every time i have brought my car in for service i have been provided with a loaner and not just any loaner but an s5 convertible
they are total jerks and no one should use them
go to an hour oil change location that advertises a 995 oil change and let me know if you walk out with a 995 charge
the message was audi of charlotte only wants scheduled oil changes
i am told that there is something wrong with my car and is going to be over 1000 to fix
it was great working with warren and the staff
i came in for advice on a battery for a car fob and to ask about replacing the shell for my custom autostart device
they clean the parking lot all the time
i cant imagine how much food gets thrown out from expiring instead of selling
avoid the diabolical touch screen automated ordering system
no visible smoke
great paint match
i have been going to pep boys for 30 years now for much of my vehicle repairs
i dont know if there were extenuating circumstances with those  slowbees or what but my experiance was great
get a call from these guys offering to give me a full refund on what they had charged me
i dont think there is enough words to express my gratitude for her
upon reviewing the new paperwork everything matched except one fine detail they had checked no on whether the car was eligible for camvap if you dont know what that is check here camvapca  in short its a consumer protection that does binding arbitrations if you ever have a dispute with your dealermanufacturer
mike showed up  on time and was super friendly
will definitely go back again
for a busy person you can get most of the work done in three hours while youre waiting
a helmet and goggles are provided but you might still want to bring sunglasses
i had such a wonderful experience with autonation chevrolet arrowhead location
review part 1 sales last summer i wanted to buy a jetta tdi the hardtofind diesel version of the ubiquitous jetta
so the sales rep albert shows me a number around 18000
their service guys went out of their way to accommodate me and to get me back on the road that same day
i would recommend scot to anyone who had any type of motorcycleharley super bike quadetc
this didnt happen
returned to sam sam says theres a fluid leak
but i got 2 different opinions through very well known mechanics and they both came up with the same report
if you see a ted wiens and think to yourself that you could use their service drive literally anywhere else
i got gs auto service to pick it up and after looking at it they told me that what rayco had suggested wasnt even causing the problemit would have made the car run better just as a general tuneup
ive purchased three nissans over the course of roughly four years and the staff at autonation nissan always make the process as smooth as it could possibly be
was helped immediately
he also offered to scrape the ca registration off the windshield which was nice though cleaning the ugly sticky residue and fingerprints off the windshield would have been an even nicer touch
attempted to contact him multiple times with no answer and no return call
he said i could wait for an hour for a tow truck
3 i called in a day before and scheduled a car appraisal
i purchased a 2017 hyundai sonata  sport on january 31 i was very pleased with the service and everyones treatment and their attention  to my needs and requests
i thought that was super nice something she didnt have to do but did
i will definitely be going back
if youre in the neighbor need gas car washed  something to eat weve found the perfect spot
i was told this is a wear and tear problem that its not covered
of course there was las vegas has the shadiest mechanics i have ever seen
the cashier upfront wearing the disturbing white wig was very rude and unprofessional
when i walked in i was greeted by jc chokrach
i am so frustrated with this dealership that i will not be returning and do not recommend others to come either
we were in pittsburgh visiting my family and the drivers seatbelt stopped working
darren and his crew have been doing our vehicles for years and they always do an outstanding job
afterwards we were using the vacuums and one of the workers came over and inspected and saw that my car was still dirty so he said to come back around again
got showered  laundry done in one facility
all good so far
i wish we could have just written a check and bypass finance
not a good place to work
i took it down the road and notice that the mph wasnt working
hard sales and no refunds or responsibility
he seems to really cares about his customers
they should have referred me to a place that carries nitrogen instead of mixing both in my tires
this honda is so awesome
thanks for the attempt to right a wrong but its a little too late
i thought to myself hallelujah
the mister does quite a bit of work on our cars and buys a lot of the parts here
i had to start walking away as he walked with me and continued to ask me about the chip repair
its not too often that you hear a mechanic say that something is unneeded and that i need not spend my money on that
she started to get a little fussy while we were driving around  jason whipped out his phone and was showing her a fun baby app
this terribles has it all whether you are hoping to have the 35 in gas you paid for actually being 350 in gas in your tank or the car wash attendant forgetting to give you your change then this is the place for you
but what really pissed me off was that they said my cabin air filter was dirty and i had just changed it at an auto zone before my appointment
bonus thanks to a pirelli coupon i found via a link tr had ill get a rebate from pirelli on the tires
just rented our unit today and sue assistant manager was the absolute best
obvioulsy they do oil changes as well which could come in handy in a pinch although i wasnt that impressed with the selection of motor oils and filters for the price so it wouldnt be the first choice if i had to use a quick lube chain for oil
take my van here for a wash and had detail done in the past along with hand wax they did a great job i have 4 kids and they got it really clean
not sure what happened in this department but your advisors need some serious customer service training
our uber dropped us off
when he called me back with the buy agreements on both vehicles i was not available so he left me a voice message that was transcribed on my iphone stating that i would have my loan paid off in full
i had an effortless time communicating with john who is one of the nicest people i have ever had the pleasure of working with
they were super helpful and confident in their work
i love getting my oil changes done here
your team all came together to make it happen
i stopped in on my way home from work to get an oil change
manager was very friendly
had a super experience with mark siffert and brian miller
debit purchases are so slow that a cashier will open up a second register to keep the lines moving
i would highly recommend this company if you are selling or buying a vehicle
she has no authority so whatever she says does not matter
if you expect a nice clean car dont their few vehicles available are dirty and cockroach infested
i was in and out of there in a hour
they could told me when i took the car back
anywayi called monday morning and spoke to kelly
thanks to josh and serviceking
so it ended up being a lot less out of pocket than the others
dont take your car here
pretty dang good bbq
i purchased almost 1600 of parts from bell toyota
they also had a great selection available to choose from
shortly after posting my last review on big o tires i received a phone call from the regional district manager of western automotive  big o tires
we came in with too much gravel in the bed of our truck to let us go through so they offered to refund our money or clean it out for us
and dont pretend you dont speak english i saw your reaction to the words bagel pizza from the other side of the store
if i have questions they are always helpful and willing to thoroughly explain things
fast and inexpensive compared to other shops out there
the buying process was arduous and the sales and service departments are obviously disjointed
very prompt and friendly service department i will definitely be back
this place no matter how much you spend does a horrible job
they were packed the time i showed up but took very good care of me
the interior smelled fresh not like that chemical cleaner smell which i appreciated
needless to say i will never be back to this place
i think that it is a big joke and they new i was upset
when he was ringing me up i said you should mention that when you quote someone their price
when i went back to pick up my car after service they were quick and efficient
they are refusing to fix the bad tire they gave me
if i could find one complaint its that meat prices have recently risen a lot but its still a bargain relative to most meat markets
so sleazy and by far the worst
my windshield had to be replaced after a rock broke the  windshield on the drivers side
shant and anthony one was off and the other on vacation
a lady at the corner gas station suggested i come to autozone to get a plug kit and that the guys there would likely help me
truly appreciate the fast and reliable service the store offered
just like many others i usually dread the entire process of buying a car but adrian made my experience so stress free and pleasant
this place is one of the better car washes but my experience wasnt worth the 65
when i asked the guy at the end to go over this he mumbled something about having the car detailed
hands down the best mechanic shop in arizona
on an oil change
the whole experience could not be better
would not recommend this place to anybody
so you basically have to pull up to the pump to run into the store even if youre not getting gas
the guy said oh i cant honor that
look i know theyre not in the car wash business and they did  do the native repair
not much later it was marked down another 1500 for a total of 3000
if you really want good thai go to thai house on maryland parkway and silverado ranch
but other then that expect a nice menu and really fine food
if youre in the market for a vehicle go to this location and ask for jerry
about 3 joel called me and let me know that my freon was gone and that is why the ac wasnt working
these people are toxic sellers and although theres nothing wrong with making money there is something wrong with lying to customers
48 hours later i contacted them via email and informed them that as a consumer they didnt act as if they wanted my business
i could feel the difference after the aligmnet
by this time we really needed his car
i love an know my thai love the service love the wine the drinks the coconut ice cream with fried bananasa the spicey northern style chicken noodle soup the appetizer was my favorite a larb like crispy rice dish with mint lime and the best little crunchy rices ever
they had my phone number a phone call would have been nice
but it since switched to a different convenient store
so as long as my warranty is up to date  and genuine factory service and parts  i definetly will be back
there service the way you are treated is the best
when i arrived at the location my truck was still up on the rack with all wheels removed
very curteous and knowledge with my 2012 jeep liberty
convenience storegift shopcoffee shop and a restaurant
this was the easiest and best car buying process ive had so far
we are grateful for the ease of this service
i will be bringing them all my business in the future as well as recommending them to all of my friends who need exhaust work
was given a list of shops and the high was 20000 and low was15800
moved from out of state didnt no where to go
staff provided excellent customer service and were very responsive
every car ive have from them was terrible so i traded them in within the 5 days
my wife and i flew from las vegas to phoenix on june 25th 2013 and were picked up in our new vehicle
one day later my coolant level light came on and my husband had to fill it
told them my car was overheating and i needed to drive thirty miles back home from work
we were met at the door by justin i think that was his name and he was very nice made small talk asked us what we were looking for
she even made the la fashion paper in california with the publicity
we got up to walk out and made it out the door
super nice guy and very helpful
im a repeat customer of the car shop because i get quality service at a fair price every time
i am grateful to find someone honest that provides quality work
they told me about two hours
must try when youre in vegas
i brought the car in for a 4 wheel alignment i expect to get a 4 wheel alignmentin fact i paid for a 4 wheel alignment but it wasnt done
because its one of the few places in pittsburgh area where you can get e85 gasoline
i wish this place was close to home and id pay for a membership to get my car washed here
after this next repair i am never coming to this place again
no one is looking for thier car to come out looking like it was just manufactured but not wiping down the interior leaving dirt on the windows i seriously could go on and on
prices are very reasonable 30 for a tunnel wash and hand wax
i enjoyed a bag of complimentary popcorn a soda and a brownie
from a simple oil change to more advanced issues they took care of the car honestly and affordable
after calling and telling them what the problem was and that i only needed to bring in the cassette and that it would be obvious what the problem was they insisted that i needed to bring in the entire trailer so they could make sure that it alighted properly
i had just gone to checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd
honest and highly recommended
couldnt ask for more
no big deal though
i wish you could add no stars
and remind me why i hate dealerships
at this point my patience trust and tolerance ended
i just returned from a trip to palm springs and the volvo had a lot of brake dust on the wheelsrims which is atypical apparently for european cars
i would highly recommend stopping in to get your car serviced here
probably the best thai in las vegas
we bought a 9 dollar part and changed it ourselves
they charge some stupid price so after i left i just went to auto zone and bought a new one for 1200 and i replaced it myself
i also have a new issue now
he removed several dents dings and one very large section of damage the result of a huge dent that we tried to repair ourselves and he even made that look like new again
i will come back to this place for any and everything having to do with my vehicle from now on
i went in with a coupon for a free oil change and they immediately said they dont honor the coupons
he changed the hoses and only charged me for the once over
they called me later with the results  said it needed the carburetor rebuilt for around 400
they got us in that day a saturday they did not have the part in stock but ordered it
most recently i had put 30k miles on the car and went in for the recommended factory service
the left valve cover was leaking a bit of oil
these guys didnt honor the coupon for two dollars less than competitor
i used to love this place they do a great job cleaning your vehicle
i look forward to my next shopping experience at phoenix renegades
inside bathroom is covered in graffiti and floors are always nasty
i purchased the lexus is 250 convertible and have been nothing but happy with it
great selection good prices free air for your tires quality gas that cleans the engine as you drive
never again will i come here
i bought a car here which the sales man named hector and his manager insisted on how much of a monhly payment that i wanted to pay
its has the typical cheap gas station prices 812 but above average gas station car wash service
my neighbor who is a mechanic checked it out and said to me that a tune up was not done and no parts were repaired
knowing that i had a long drive ahead of me they squeezed me in even without an appointment to make sure id have a safe drive
mike will not treat you with respect he will lie straight to your face  give you the worst attitude
very bad service
generally the quality of the work has been fairly good my main complaint is while they are cheaper than the stealerships they still arent exactly affordable
ive been taking my 05 525i to alex since i moved to az in 11
because good year didnt even have my filter
he got the two pieces of tempered glass cut and installed from his supplier and they were installed two days later
i used the least expensive 50 dollar service
find anything anything will be better than this place
great customer service and this was one time i didnt dread waiting for an oil change
even more reason for me to be skeptical not to buy it but i did my research and this was the best option for me
super friendly and great customer service
well today is november 6th and its now been 14 weeks and i still do not have my refund
not only was my sales transaction 100 seamless they went above and beyond to give me all of my options get me into a car that fit all of my specifications and find the absolute best deal available
place is nice new roomy waiting area had comfortable seating free wifi complimentary kuerig coffee minifridge with free yogurtwatercokediet coke
snail motorsports always gives great service in my opinion
as i was walking out the door he called me a dumb a
that being said i would definitely use them again
and i really tried
rosa takes the time to explain what the problem is what is required to correct the problem and how much the repair will cost
you need to make an appointment but ill definitely be going again
i then received a safety recall notice in the mail which said your part is in and to call and schedule for service
i emailed joseph asking about the warranty refund
and they have financing
i dont really like having to fix my car but this is the place i trust
tips  if youre going for dinner youll want to make a reservation
there is a lot of competition in this city however many of those competitors offer the lick and stick type of work
google was more helpful than this business
my main disappoint was not saving room for the famed mango dessert
do not waste your time here
i really support toyo
it had a load leveling system
they try to lie to you so that you are forced to pay more for an upgrade
he sighed annoyed i can only assume and took name
i love this place
called to ask about a price on a bike
this dealership tells different story every second
ill preface by saying whether youre going to meineke or to your ridiculously overpriced local dealer i believe most mechanic managersowners are the scum of the earth
they operate here with no accountability
i waited from 300pm until 720pm and the inside was still dirty
very reasonable kept me updated the whole time as far as how much time remained
i arrived around 10 am they took the car and indicated it would take an  hourbut in fact it took about 15 minuteswow
with me being a lady i know ive been taken advantage of at other shops
we purchased a jeep in reno nv earlier this year and had some issues with the jeep when we moved down to vegas a few months ago
doug also tried to push us into purchasing a platinum which they obviously wanted off the lot which had 700 miles on it
the most enjoyable car purchase experience i have ever had
ganley westside imports did perform the 30000 mile service so you need to check with them
cancelled the insurance and wont be shopping with them again
the shop might be great but i wont be going back nor will i refer them to anyone else
so instead of trying to correct my situation as a customer as a business you should be correcting your situation as a service representative
they got the exact tire we needed on short notice and got us in and out in about 30 minutes so we could continue our trip as planned
2  found glass in my car where the window was smashed
i didnt know for sure if this one would have it but they did
well i went back and read the groupon and yes i did rate protectant for 69
this should have been done before the car was sold
fried stuff chicken this was an interesting dish
every time i get my trucks oil change here it is the best service and done well i cannot complement them enough a friend of mine rented a van here and once again the service was the best and i have had their rental trucks they could pass the glove test and service is awesome
i would highly recommend san tan ford for  any new or used vehicle purchase
the general manager curtis is the man to know
bought a vehicle there and the original deal was awesome
where to get it from
around 1pm they had a manager i had never dealt with gave me a too bad so sad approach to telling me they could do nothing for me
i will never  be doing business with them again
i went to mm to get a couple small rust spots fixed and also have some scratches removed
once i decided i wanted to purchase i was out the door in 2 hours
but the staff seem disorganized
when your on the forum you can see when a vendor or member last logged in
the valet guy brought me my cords but failed to give me a bag from nordstroms i had in the loaner and now the tags are missing
come on people you deal in glass
i have been waiting on the side of the 202 at gilbert road with my sister in 110 degree heat for the 2 hour window they initially gave us and now they are telling us to wait an additional 90 minutes because they cant find us
i took my brand new lexus worth 50000 for wash and ended up with black spot and tire polishing residue on car paint
we left really happy
well not no more
i said so why are you trying to sell me a 2013 dirt bike for 3300
so when progressive called to tell me that yet another tow company was going to be arriving to pick me up my patience was worn out
dont go here
i got a 2009 mini cooper on february 23 2016 from las vegas car and truck it started to over heat in a month and i had the superior warranty plan engine completely flooded with coolant on on august 23 2016 this is a common issue with mini coopers and no body would fix my car the dealership or the warranty provider reported them to the bbb and the dmv
good thing i never yelled at the guy
the front seat hadnt been vacuumed at all the floor was done okay but the back seat looked like they have just waived the vacuum over the seat without actually making contact with the seat itself
i will also recommend them to everyone i know
obviously running some sort of insurance scam
this same chode had the audacity to ask just prior to this if i would still hook him up with a helicopter ride  kevin i would love to take you on a helicopter ride
in fact i will be in to speak with who ever is in charge because i think that this would be a great little extra something in my employees
i would recommend them to any new car purchaserand definitely going to choose a honda for future car needs
no water or beverage was offered
service department review  warning   never take your vehicle here to be serviced or have work done
oh wait i asked them not to apply armor all and to simply wipe the interior down so they screwed that up too
now even ive put back the stick the burning smell still comes back after some period of driving
service was great
i was about to head out on a big trip so i decided it was best to know what was going on so i set an appointment
also there is no real place to wait inside
he started asking tons of questions like what car i drive now why i want to test drive what i do etc
thx no stars deserved seriously
shortly thereafter i ran out of gas and had to have the car towed to the dealership
the gas is always cheap a full service garage attached great discounts on gas if car wash is purchased extensive food menu excellent craft beer selection parma people watching and great music played on the outdoor speakers
the owner treated me like family
over and done in 12 hour
she said she would have to check with her manager
the engine stutter gave me the impression that the problem was probably due to a plugged fuel filter or failed fuel pump
how awesome is that
the managers did nothing about this
he said it was the best thai in vegas hands down
a bit longwinded but may be worth it ive been going to conrads since i moved to cuyahoga county fours years ago
youre customer service sucks so much and youre trying to tell me that you are being kind
when im about to pick up my car and we crossed path not even a simple goodbye or thank you
its more than 10pages long with a list of your standard curries in addition to the numerous traditional dishes plus dishes from different regions of thailand add to that a page or more of noodle dishes salads appetizers etc  it is enormous
i think this is insulting your mistake you made the guest drive up to take the car and you failed to examine the work before guest come
i doubt the engine was that clean the day i bought it
when i got to a red light i noticed some white fluid under where my steering wheel is
very happy with my experience at distinctive detailing
i say no thanks and ask about the check engine that recently came on in our other vehicle and he says its 100 to tell me why the light is on and doesnt include any repairs
as described above my interactions with the staff during the deal were fast and easy
weve been with sun devil auto for over 20 years and cant say enough about how theyve taken care of all our family vehicles each and everytime
the best car wash in las vegas
he said put it on the rack and lets take a look
so its normal for their parts to break so soon
i took it then to honda who found the problem fixed it for a very reasonable price and i drove it away tires and all intact
i wish every jiffy lube were like this one
unfortunately the salesperson failed to remove the security tab causing a huge inconvenience the day of the dance to return to sears to have it removed
these people dont care about customer service
if you do get financed you can bring your car back within a year and they will increase your credit limit by almost 50 there is so much more i just could remember it all
thank you jennifer and the team of mechanics who take great care of me and my mazda
i believe her name was daisy
i thought it might need a recharge but got a call after dropping it off that the compressor was bad and it and all its parts needed to be replaced to the tune of 2500
was my fault for this how dare i the cash register team member needs to be a lot more friendlier especially when you say no on the gift cards
so they cant be all bad and must be doing something good in order to remain in business
i have a 2001 winnebago 35 adventurer which had broken front glass on both panes
my car was in the shop for weeks because they couldnt get the parts
he kept in contact with me throughout process
trash right by front entrance completely full  overflowing
oh and they didnt properly clean my battery cables so i had to go to autozone 40th  thunderbird and they cleaned them for me for free
all this for 120
informs me that i put in too much of the ac pro and my unit is at risk of blowing
i drive to the best buy which happens to be 20 minutes farther than the one closer to me but that one didnt have the tv in stock and i walk up to the online order counter give the employee my credit card and drivers license and am told another employee will be bringing it out
here are some reasons why     seriously
it will keep your ride healthy for more miles down the road
if you want a mini i suggest justin at irvine mini you will get way better service and without the attitude
apparently best buy thinks its funny to con their customers into waiting for 5 hours in line for advertised products that they dont even have in stock
ive always been greeted at the door by a hello and a smile
i am very disappointed in the service my friend and i received here and will not return
not to mention we were able to look at a few within our small budget and found one with bunks for the kids which we were really hoping for
they made some suggestions as to what might need to be fixed and by when
i had no intention of buying a car that day but the next day i would come back and actually purchase one
i know that they wont take advantage
when i offered to pay for their time they said not to worry
booked a penske truck and trailer for my move to texas called and pushed the date back a couple of days
this place has ruined my taste for cheap thai food back home in denver sorry thai basil
i ended up needed an entire new engine with some other work needed to go along with it
nor did i complain as i could see they were trying their best
i hope he relocates and goes somewhere where peoples time and circumstance are better respected
if you cannot even put correct pressure in tires why would i buy over 2k of tires from you
we use costco for gas nonperishable food items pet supplies electronics nutritional supplements and just about everything else imaginable
i called auto glass buddy and i said theres no way this is a bad referral
the location suggests the area is more working class than snobby scottsdale so their inventory and pricing reflects the value of their products unlike go az
customer service top notch and eager to please no matter how bad before you buy some cheep knock off racing wheels on ebay  go see jason thanks guys
this place has really gone downhill over the last year or so
he was great with everything except he was helping not just us but seemed to be two other couples
in the past getting a new tire was always an hours long ordeal of calling around to see whats available
its such a shame that they have moved on
i am the type of person that when my mind is set on something i want it to get it done now when i am thinking about it not the next day because i will forget and then it wont get done
cash or credit selfwashing bays
i stopped in this morning because i had a low tire pressure alert come up
who writes a review of a gas station
although they do have some of the best pricing on their ceramic film
also needed air filters changed and the guys made sure to physically show me the old and new as they replaced them
this is the best place to buy a car
the only reason i couldnt give them 5 stars is because i asked if they could check the passenger side airbags light which came on
if you want to finance the bike the business and sales team gives you excellent advise
he told me maybe they can give me a coupon next time but he doesnt have any right now
but the service from the gentleman who received my car was inexcusable
found az xtreme glass on line and saw that they were located close to where i lived
so much for a oil change
but i would have been better served going to the 3 drive thru wash and drying it myself on the other end because thats exactly what it looks like i did
i honestly didnt know you could buy one windshield wiperthats so crazy but they provided me the option to buy one
all of the windows were so clean i had to double check that they were still there
he said he already did and hung up
i drove to busy buggy for a second option
i was already missing work to get this taken care of
i brought my 2007 toyota prius for new tires
they returned me my car completely unfixed and when i returned it to get fixed again it took another week
he told me 589 for all four struts
i get everything i need and get out rather quickly
i found a car i liked online and sent out an inquiry
based on those two experiences i wholeheartedly recommend scotts coach works
gotta give props to mary p  she checked me in and was super friendly and knowledgeable so wanted to give her props since ive had all sorts of not so great experiences with rental car checkin folks at other companies
he was stranded for about an hour far away from home while a dealership employee came with a battery charger
call these guys
only great experiences and customer service from this guy
the one thing i like about going to this place is that if i have one car problem thats all they will fix
do not trust this shop  they are not honest
they opened the gates at 830 am and as i and two more vehicles drove inso did a dozen more
im sorry for anybody whom may come into crossroads with these people
we explained the problem and without a second thought he went out to check on the car turned out to be a very simple fix
many pumps to use but sometimes it does get busy and you will have to wait for an available station
the old dude at the desk was more interested in sipping his coffee than helping me out
sixty bucks was a bargain for this experience
one of my favorite places to fill up on gas
finance manager chuck
it was supposed to take 1015 mins at the most ended up taking an hour
let me first say that the service was excellent mostly due to the assistant to the waiter but excellent none the less
they even buffed out other unrelated minor scratches on my car
my main issue with the whole car buying experience is the salespeople
the inspection  didnt take as long as had been told and krystal was super nice and thorough
i usually go with enterprise
there is no communication at all
the body work was ok the windshield replacement was a total unprofessional install
my experiences have been super friendly hospitable and efficient
after attempting more that 10 times on several different occasions to contact the gm which by the way didnt exist either as i was told on the phone  or someone who was willing to help  not one person was willing to help i really just wanted to give the car back and run away from these creeps
i wanted to express how unhappy i am with my service at the boulder highway location
i did not immediately leave a review because i wanted to see how their service was in the months following  it has been top notch
so i just spent 2700 for someone to hook it up for 5 mins or so and have to pay someone again for another testwhen its fixed
well worth it
for us in our opinion there is no reason for us to deal with acura of peoria ever again
however i still get calledemailed
as a general consumer the best part was knowing you were getting the best price  at a shop that knows their stuff
ahhh mvp valet guys  just when you think this suck ass garage cant get any worse the mvp valet guys prove you wrong by driving 40 mph up the ramp take up all of the spots that the suckers like me pay for every month and then beep the horn of the persons car they are parking while riding your ass because youre only going 10 mph faster than the recommended speed limit
once i got in i felt more assured about my decision to go with a hyundai by ted and his friendly staff
he gives me a paper and says sign it
i highly recommend using this company for any occasion you might have
upon arriving at the dealership the forester that my husband and i intended to purchase was ready for a test drive
jeff made getting my bike repaired very easy for a 3500 pick updelivery charge he picked it up and returned it to my home
james is an awesome salesman with a very pleasant personality
jeff assured us that it would not change so we piled into the car and went to test drive the crv  we got there and were told that someone else had taken the car for a test drive
because of royaltys incompetence my husband had to buy a new a car just to be able to get to and from work
the work is always done right and fast
also everyone who posted a pic and reviewed this place only posted pad thai
each time i visit the employees have been very helpful and infomative
i began taking an acura rsxs to hondatronics from here on out i will refer to this store as ht
every time i pull up to the kiosk i get hounded by the sales thugs to buy one
every time i would find a great deal on a  vehicle it was at bill luke fiat
so i tried toyota town and country and had similar experiences
the first time i stopped by the dealership he talked me through the two vehicles i was interested in and looked into what the prices might look like with their current incentives
weve had numerous problems with them from hitting our truck with the air chuck  chipping the paint on its first service to keeping it for 3 weeks to try  fix the over spray they created by neglecting to have a body shop fix it but instead having a mobile repair spray it in the wind in the back of the parking lot
my insurance company called them and told them that insurance will cover it and to call me to schedule an appointment
this is the type of response i have been getting on this issue for nine months now
getting propane took forever and a day
neil and jesus have earned a long term customer and a strong referrer
today i only had to pick up a can of auto body filler so it wasnt that bad
she barely acknowledges me again looks at her computer and begins to complain that i didnt do it right because she cant see it on her screen
abc hyundai is paying for everything
bike was pretty new and in excellent order
more then my car was worth it
they are a little slow also so i wouldnt go here if youre in a hurry
very friendly and fast
i had to pay 98 to get my car back with no work done to it at all
they were about to close but they took the car in anyway now thats what i call great customer service
after my car was brought here they diagnosed my car and said that my head gasket blew and it would cost about 2200 dollars to fix
heres a suggestion
also would like to thank sara robles landon the warranty guy and the sales and service managers for working to make us completely happy with the durango before we left the lot
he sent an employee to put my spare on
got in line behind a guy who was spending over 500 dollars and took quite a while probably 1215 minutes
great customer service
just had my c7 stingray done
great car collection but they refused to take their free coupon online without it being printed out which is absurd a waste of money and trees
he says i have to find somebody else because he cant do it
im so glad i was able to find such a detailoriented caring and friendly detailer
they are big supporters of those in the armed forces and work with usaa members to get the best deal a huge plus
this place is pretty nice fairly priced and they do a great job
i took my car here for an inspection and they said that it would cost 692 for exhaust and 250 for brakes to get my car to pass
we picked the car up yesterday and it looks real nice
i was in and out in less than am hour
i like supporting an independent local auto shop theyre awesome
integrity in not trying to oversell me on any unnecessary services
i took a leap of faith because i did not have a company to go to
having already used 2 less than stellar body shops in las vegas my heart sank when i got rearended
go elsewhere save your money
right honda always treats me nice and i always feel like ive received a great value
saved me a ton of money
not only am i impressed with the work that was completed on my car im beyond  impressed with the knowledge and customer service that was provided to me
he said that the tires originally quoted were not the right size but he was upgrading me to another tire and taking care of the cost
the vacuuming was much better but the dash glove compartment and console were still very dirty
this shop promises good deals and the lowest price in town but deliver poor quality service
because i was already loaded up and rolling
also they had donuts ive never seen in any other 711 or donut shop before
only the first guy had a positive review but that is a long time  ago
i wish i remembered his name but he was wearing glasses
robert the store manager is really good
ive always seen them as one of the best when it comes to just tires
i have a ferrari 458 spider and love the fact that no brushes and nothing hits the car but water
i recommend you to everyone who needs work done
questions were asked and he nailed the answers
that is how bad this place is
this place is great if you want parts removed from your car
the assistant manager said he wold give me a few free car washes
i decided to get take care of this one
i asked for the dish medium spice level and i thought it was spoton
i wish to hell id read reviews before going there their operation is quite shady
but most importantly they have always been honest with me
i even prepaid my car but they had nothing available till god knows when
i went home to drop off my family and when i came back 10 minutes later a new manager came and said that i would not get any money but instead 75 in car washes
but dude on the phone informed me that theyre cheaper because they were rated for less miles than the michelin ones
another guy rushed to come clean the window
fortunately i am not outside the statute of limitations and am currently looking at litigation options again because of the underhanded sales and service practices that tempe dodge is fluent in
kevin was very flexible and helpfull
just had everything inspected and that i was just cheap
i feel she went above and beyond what she needed to do in order to make sure i was satisfied
hands down this has been a great experience and ill definitely be a returning customer
give me a break if that was the case i should have just changed it myself
we only bought this because it was already set up as a tow behind for our new 2015 rv we heard not all vehicles are set up to be flat towed so its good this one was already set up for it we originally went out to their dealership to look at a geo tracker and they did spend the time helping us figure out if that was able to be flat towed
the tint job itself on my 2012 crv looked decent from the outside
at first their response was we may have just connected it wrong  a mechanic cant connect it correctly
i was quoted a very reasonable price
i highly recommend body pro collision
finally the service manager at las vegas acura told me the window had hard water damage
then the second time i went i pointed out a few things and they seemed angry at me for making them do more work
the specific wheels i wanted were out of stock and they recommended the same brandstyle with slightly different specs
the showroom needs a major facelift
i dont feel that i was taken advantage of in any way
i wish i could give negative stars on this place
only good thing to say is the vehicle was within the 30 day no deductible warranty period so i did not pay anything
very knowledgeable about repairing power window issues
i paid for my oil change drove home and popped the hood
super easy transaction good clean work and a friendly helpful owner and staff
might be a problem if you live in a condo
anybody that needs a great mechanic i would definitely send them to here
yeah no thanks
im always wiping my car down
i was so fed up i ended up basically sitting in the dealership with my family refusing to leave telling everyone that came in what they were really all about literally every person turned around and did not make a purchase and obviously they kicked us out so i called the police on them which apparently is a normal thing at this location according to the police officer
everything to crave your late night munchies
this is my recommendation
same pattern he finished the service then held my receipt in his hands while he rants for 20 minutes
i came in as an informed buyer
got offered a drink water or soda when i arrived and theres also candy
craig was extremely knowledgeable about the vent and the door being blocked
he personallly comes in on saturday his day off and spends two hours cleaning off the overspary and polishing the exterior of the car
even the extended warranty i bought was half the price other dealers charge
never going there again
their goal is to sell you the car and get you out of there as quick as possible
they contacted nissan tech support they sent a part right away
when i was encouraged to change my cabin air filer  i also declined
the guys at this shop are the real deal
the parking lot is massive and the csrs are a good bunch of people with excellent customer service skills
last december i took my car to him to replace a blown engine from a choice of many cheaper quotes
i am so happy to have finally found my neighborhood car place and will for sure return the next time my car needs servicing
used car presale checks have always been accurate
they said the car had no rust but when it was put on the rack it had major rust issues
even after i showed them the proper installation technique using the original blade they continued to argue that they were the correct blades
they had us fill out a case report and told us we would be getting a call from their case management
even paid him more than he asked to repair the tire because it was such great service
i had to take a shower
erica from customer support over the phone was lovely efficient and so so so kind
the bad the service
update  customer relations manager danielle contacted me and apologized for all of this and reimbursed me for complete service
the serice is as good as it gets
you cant even tell there was a dent in the door
from my initial phone call i felt i had found the right place
are you surprised
dirty broken parts stains burns yet they charged us a cleaning fee
they also had the tech come out and talk to me about my top not working he told me the motor for my top was shot and would cost me close to 80000 to replace
you can buy a can of tire dressing at the auto store and do it  yourself
i went in and they had a huge selection of affordable cars
then again the guys at eurowise makes it easy on me
the best thai food that ive ever experienced
i also had the front windshield film applied and it makes a huge difference
our family service adviser is don mulmby he is so kind caring and professional
and people in the neighborhood been going to his place for years
both simba and curtis went out of their way to make us feel welcome and valid even though we had no intention of buying at that moment
the cashier gladly took the yelp coupon with no fuss
ive rented several times from unitedalways have a great experience
i recognize and appreciate your dedicated efforts
guys do a good job at washing your car
great job butch
thank you cochran hyundai
at first i didnt want to deal with it
i love my kia sportage by the way
they took the time to listen to all my questions help assess which vehicle would be the best size for my move and provided the absolute best care when it came to properly preparing myself  my belongings for the drive
the bus driver directed me to the two aisles of autos for our emerald club rate
now im no mechanic but i know when something doesnt quite sound right
i understand sales i was a saleswoman for many years
it just so happened that we had taken my sons car to the other shop the day before we found max auto for my daughters truck weve had my daughters truck back for 3 days  my sons is still at the other shop  they still dont really know
yesterday i picked up my street triple r
mike was straight forward answering all my questions and explaining options and upgrades
i forgot to write a review for the excellent service i got from sun auto a few weeks ago when i had a major repair
get your car tinted here they do an amazing job and have great prices
paul was helpful informative realistic thorough and completely took whatever anxiety someone might have in the whole car buying process away
and really we come here just for the fun of coming here even if we dont need anything at all
they wont even comp the paint on the front end as an apology to not disclosing the info
it had a horizontal crack almost all the way across the front
both my vehicles had been hacked up prior to chase working on them and were a rats nest to say the least
reasonable prices as well
they have two entrances and quite a few staff there and at the ready
i said excuse me
im writing this review now because i received a notification in the mail for a recall for my 2014 nissan altima
if they were upfront about how long things would take they would not have so many upset customers
i didnt buy the vehicle at the time but i still really want that car and im 99 sure im going to buy from avondale mazda
kasie and jacob were very helpful and super friendly
thank you so much for changing my perception on caliber collision
byronthe service rep tried to talk me into upgrading to premium option for 50 more but i refused
its worth passing by two jiffy lubes that are closer to my home to come to this one
this place has the worst service ever
my husband and i had a wonderful experience at this dealership
i asked him if could refer me to a place that could help but that was no help either
ill never park at the airport again
helpful with any questions or concerns
i couldnt be happier with the product or service
update  was contacted by corporate they said there was nothing they could do for me because i didnt go back to the store to have them replace the battery
most impressive was the two wines that were ordered came in the appropriate glasses
service was fast
they do a very poor  job for what you pay
they insisted that because we waited for months we now had to buy the key for 350
after discussing options we came to an agreement and decided to go with the mdx that i test drove
i was on my lunch hour so that worked out well
i went and got my car 475 paidand out the door
everything that i ever had done on my car here always breaks within a month after having it fixed
best thai food ever
yet another less than stellar experience at bmw north scottsdale apparently the norm for this bmw branded penske dealership
it was amazing
maybe if i win the powerball with the 2 bill i got i will be more charitable but for now stay far away from this dealer
but point of this review is they damaged the paint on the hood of my car
repair quality was good they do look like new
then i was walked out to my car and had to remove my personal belongings from my old car into the new one
and apparently the general manager is on vacation
i can honestly say i dont care how long the service takes because i feel like im at the office working while i wait here in style
it was great to actually see the jacket instead of a picture
we hit there after the lunch rush
soooo it has been over two years since my last review the service at farm and fleets small engine repair no longer meets my standards
i just got back from getting my oil changed here
it just seems to me that mark mitsubishi could have done the right thing in the beginning and made sure the vehicle was in good working order before putting it out on the lot
thats not a cheap task on a mini cooper so i asked if we should go ahead and do the back brakes at the same time
wont honor their price given
if thats not excellent customer service and service than i dont know what it is
seem like very honest people
of the ones that did sell i bet 1 in 20 got the asking price or higher
quality work are put into everything they do
thx henry joel and kayli
as a general rule booking a salon appointment generally falls somewhere in line alongside root canals and blind dates on my anxiety scale two hours in an uncomfortable chair trying to impress someone that i will probably never see again of course i flosslove kidsget regular trims
pulled up to do some shopping at the stores
we went to our mechanic to get everything fixed
i decided to just replace the spark plug wires and when i picked it up it ran perfectly
i have been in the sales industry for 23 years so i am pretty particular on how i am treated follow up and just overall customer service
2nd time i was in a bind and needed to get something done fast with a car that had taken a dump
told them that was ridiculous and would take it somewhere else
i highly recommend this place
bill jeff and before he moved to another store guyall excellent
im assuming the ones that work during those shifts are people that dont know too much about cars
avoid this place
dont go to this location
i did and he found out what i was looking for and said he would look before asking me to drive all the way down
moreover they told me over the phone that they didnt know how long it would take possibly 3 hours but theyd knock off the extra time if they got it done faster
definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a new car and will definitely return
ill definitely be back in 56k to this location
yes they take their time so dont go if youre in a hurry
chose this shop to get a helmet and gloves after reading yelp reviews of area motorcycle equipment vendors
i know she didnt have too but im thankful she did as i was able to run other errands while my car was getting cleaned
i exchanged a few words stating how impersonal and rude he was being
and a bulb
he came to my home to detail and buff wax my black f150
i could hear them saying   i came in for an affordable car and thought i could get this instead of a used car
all of a sudden there was a rush to get me done
stay away from this crooked rotten dealer just bad all the way around
he wanted to show me what my free 15 wash included in a snarky tone
while a fellow employee was looking for a car to show us another nissan representative who was a young guy who looked like he was in high school went out of his way to talk to my father and i without knowing what is going on he just jumps in and says the car just got sold
i love garlic so these were perfect for me
i had shopped around on the price and they came out at about 25 cheaper than other places
so i wasnt terribly happy to get it replaced
so we drove off in our new to us car and left our old car behind
after a few hours we reached an agreement
been coming for over 3 years now
they got all the details correct stripes badges rubber snubbers panel alignment etc
no matter how busy these guys always greet me with a smile and take great care of me every time
the older middle aged woman who answered my phone call 10 minutes prior to closing was extremely rude and smug  had me on hold for no reason for over 10 minutes
most recently i came in to replace a tire and it was done very quickly and the service was polite and friendly
best auto shop in town
recently i had the pleasure of working with quite simply the nicest most professional used car salewoman ever
if you decide to purchase a vehicle from aar i advise you to bring a mechanic to look over every square inch of that vehicle
fantastic cars in fantastic condition on a fantastic purposebuilt track
the drunken noodles are deliciousfull of flavor and spices
i will try again but will still be in search of a car wash that is willing to do just a little more than the rest
i like how they keep their customer involved in the entire process
i could tell the bmw hadnt been driven in a while for very far because the rotors had rust on them and now i know why
so i get back home and call the number the lady at the customer service desk that was 20 feet away from me when i was there answers and puts me on hold 10 mins or so
checking in was easy guy was super nice
mark you calendar for one year to get you free rotation and inspection
i needed show shine quality on my classic 1972 chevelle
i called in and made an appointment before coming to get my oil changed and omar helped me fill out some paperwork and got my car started early since i got there a little early
i never expected to be eating regularly at a gas station but i get food here every few days
i left and went to get the free car wash i was informed by the man at the car wash that i had not paid for my lube and must return to pay
i must say that bebe and ray were very accommodating and professional
instead it was take to there yard
they coulda really made this a mess n screwed me over but they did not
i had a tire issue on my street glide now i dont i called ahead danny said come on over
we had an explorer
hands down the best experience
duck was perfectly crispy and juicy and the curry
they said battery may be weak bring it in at that time car was a year and 3 months old
however i no longer lease and finally needed an oil change
imagine you been dreaming about the perfect car you preorder it  got it down to your budget  go pick it up  this screw ball comes in and some quot overseen mistake was made and the principle of the entire situation was not handled correctly
highly recommend lotus of siam great food and friendly service
i always bring my pup too and everyone is so cool
with big bright windows the dmv is dare i say it inviting
i definitely will be going back when i need my car polished up again
ken did the work for free
the estimate was reasonable and lowered than the other quotes we got
they did my car tents fast and  sufficient
the staff is really wonderful
i got my car towed and wasnt too upset about it because i knew i was in the wrong i called and they said if i come by 5 it will be 247
after that i was so disgusted with the switches i went home thought about it over the weekend and came back in to get a refund for my 50000 downpayment
people start reviewing the actual service
throwing numbers around is never fun but if thats part of the game so be it
i grew up in upstate new york where everybody had an uncle or a good friend who owns a garage that you could trust
ryan does a great job and was just as thorough with my old honda as he was with the brand new beamer in the shop
so other guy takes my car inshortly informs me that car now needs new fuel injectors  totaling 489
steve followed up with me during the whole delivery process setting up a convenient appointment time and even accomodated for my busy work schedule
had someone i met thru  a friend do it at his house but he left a lot of overspray
said the owner
i wish i could pop 20 in and sit in it all day
when i asked about inspection on that vehicle todd rudely informed me that as is means uninspected and that they dont do nothin to these cars before they turn around and sell them
i make sure i have all my supplies just in case im there forever
expected it to take awhile
a little minor problem and he fixed it without even charging me
i travel often and i use yelp to help my find restaurants and other things so this is the first time ive used it for a different application
he was able to make the repair the same day i called which was a major plus because i needed to head home asap
i was told i would not get into any new car for that price and i should go ahead and lease as its the same thing as buying anyways
we just wanted some original unsweet tea and they were out
at least for me
the price was very reasonable with the added bonus of not having to leave my house
contacted these buffoons via their online contact form last night about a specific nissan rogue
this place is so shady and so slimy that now i dont know if i would trust even buying a cpo vehicle from them even if the price was reasonable and my attorney was involved
tried to pressure me into thinking i needed to buy a battery for 280 when i all i needed was my head light fixed
i feel bad for the owner because as a business owner myself its very hard to find good employees and ultimately they are a reflection of the company as a whole
based on the condition of my vehicles now totaling four ive been advised that i could safely defer certain maintenance for another 6 months 12 years and at least once that it would not be needed until it stop working without impacts to safety of passengers or mechanical wellbeing of the vehicle
unfortunately by the time we were closing the transaction the manager stated that i never received in writing that clause
the waiting area was clean and inviting
she was lovely to deal with in setting up my appointment  informative without being salesy a difficult balance to master
went out to start my car about a week ago and the battery was dead
terry and tyler whom i have worked with primarily are two of the nicest people youll meet
i went there a few weeks ago and met jeremy the salesman
carmax offered to repair both at no charge nice recovery
also supporting a local business that is loyal and honest cant be beat
i would definitely recommend this place and will be returning there in the future for my auto repair needs
he said hed send someone over
this company is completely sketchy
btw dealer fixed the car in 3 hours work
carlos apparently the sales manager is a mf puto maricon
there are many other auto dealers in the valley that wont pull this crap on their customers
nicely priced as well
i asked him how this was good news
this would not have happened had they not been on top of their game
this seems to happen all to often with hot spots that cater to a hipster crowd once a reputation is established the accounting takes over and owners lose what got them to the top in the first place  satisfying customers
the owners are real garbage  selling something you cant use they hide behind women and are woman themselves read all the reviews there real pierces of shit  true scammers
i will definitely come back here to buy my tired when needed
i was approached by a nice younger girl who was very friendly and wanted to show me the cars until i said i would not be purchasing today
i just gave them a second trynot sure why
so i checked their yelp review and noticed they closed in 11 min
as he screws it down again it cracks about 6 inches
i have purchased several honda dirt bikes had service performed and even ordered parts from western and they are always pleasant to deal with competitive in their pricing and incredibly helpful
i had a great experience here
it pretty much means either you pay the insurance or you dont get the vehicle and if i dont get the vehicle i cant get my furniture
i think its how the dealership as a whole tries to do business
well somehow the extra insurance was added without our consent
small businesses on the gravy train with larger companies need to proactively learn the larger ones standards in areas such as this or get ready for some other company to show them how its done
told me what was wrong w the car showed me the broken part and how to fix it
so 2 times now they were supposed to have replaced  my headlamp and they didnt test it either time
in contrast kellys professionalism made this process almost painless
the part was only 9 and i decided to go elsewhere to order it
one of my drivers seemed a little unprofessional but not rude
ira was really great in taking care of my car and getting me in and out as fast as possible
the taxpayers got more than bargained for with this dp
if you ever go there always look for mark
this business truly does know the meaning of customer service and if im ever in the area and in need of repairs this will be my goto spot
i would recommend wash me now to all of my neighbours and friends i had a great experience
storage space was plentiful and everything on the rv was in perfect working condition
as in vacuum for dog hair and wipe down the interior of the windows
arrived at 330am and only needed to wait a few minutes and when we returned and gathered our luggage we only waited about 15 minutes until the shuttle pulled up
my husband had been the one to change my spareand he used it to remove them and put it back in the trunk
i will be using them in the future and will recommend them highly
he refused to follow protocol and check off boxes and wrapped items on the inventory list with the color coded stickers on the box
i think thats a pretty standard question you dont have to be shocked by it
i will forever recommend busy buggy
i should have come in with a mustache and baseball cap
my biggest recommendation is the breakfast sandwiches and fill up on wednesday
thanks guys for making us feel welcome
bottom line not the best prices
im pretty sure the diet coke was actually real coke  the total bill was 30 for 2 people
the owner introduced himself to us and took very good care of us an he also got us coffee which tasted amazing
i am in a customer service job and i understand how things can be sometimes but the lack of initiative and customer service i dealt with has made me not want to buy or own a toyota
total for diagnostic parts and repair which necessitates lifting the engine on this model
after my husband returned home we inspected the truck i noticed that there were multiple water spots and film and dirt on the truck that they didnt wipe off not to mention the wheels were still dirty
thank you to paul and all the guys in the service department that are professional and easy to work with
hell theres even a bowl of cheap candy and the owner offers you a bottle of water while you wait
cannot say enough good things about this auto repair shop
i had a chip in my front windshield from a recent trip and jason did a fantastic job fixing the problem
i hereby resolve never to return to discount tire
the person who helped me was jay
my service advisor said hourly rate is 150hour he told me this the next day
they are quick and have come through for me in a pinch
i am sure they were adequate for the year the terminal was built
he even noted the few dings i had on the hood of my car
rode from ohio city to rock hall with bilal
i made sure to make an appointment for day 2 for my own vehicle and ryan said he would have tires ready for me
i said no my dealership recommends every six months versus every three months and the mechanic looked stricken and went back into the garage
at the end he showed me the damaged part they removed answered all my questions
guy said it would take about an hour to hour and half
bottom line this place sucks and please dont ever go there
amazing customer service and people care about helping others
changed my view of car experiences
i recommend shaded graphix to everyone i know
door handle fixed
discount tire and big o tires guarantees all purchases no matter how old or worn or damaged the tire
genuine you ask
thank you one stop auto i will not only be a forever customer but you best believe i will make sure to recommend them to everyone i know
then later i wanted to upgrade my tweeters and then i was given some advice to install a deck in the car it would be better sound quality so i thought about it and decided to get it done and it looks like it came right out the lot with the install and i am able to play cds and dvds which i wasnt able to before i was using a tape deck for my audio and now all i know is that i am so happy that i spend what i did and the product they had given me
i took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections
he was patient helpful and low pressure
i left the store saying thank you and he just went on without  acknowledging it
turns out same guy same owner same companyeven has employees that have been with him for 17 yearswow
like if hes the only game in town
i will 100 return to this location for years to come
the last thing i want to do is spend my saturdays down at this place getting my interlock calaberated but i have no other choice after the terrible experience i went through with this company
worth the drive to get here
after noticing the low mileage on my vehicle my advisor at nalley bmw worked a deal with bmw north america to cover 75 of the cost
they dont help you with any discounts
he mentioned the incentives hey
chuck also gave solid driving directions to the location
alex was willing to work with our time schedule
they will not help me fix it at all
had to get my license renewed and the real id they require for travel soon
i bought a minivan chrysler town  country from jason this weekend and my experience was great
these guys are always great
i was having problems with my car so i called to speak with someone and they kept transferring me to stupid idiots that do not need to be working there and dont have any clue about anything
took my 2013 jetta gli in for my complimentary 30000 mile tune up and was helped by lisa
it was a pleasure to do business with peter
screw you superman and screw all you idiots at camelback ford
it took 4 visits and many phone calls to replace a headlight
over all the weirdest experience renting a car
the guy that answered the phone kept putting me on hold in the middle of our conversation
sorry  i will never go there again
jeff n introduced me to jeff a and mark m  mark then was my guide throughout the rest of the car search process
even if there is weekend coming and you could save a day nope they dont care
overall extremely disappointed by the findlay kia store
shame on me for being nave to think that the person who checked me in and the person who sold me the service would make sure every thing was done that was promised
took 6 months
you guy are garbage just like the company you work for
this place is amazing
the real magic happened in finance even though it was a saturday they were able to seal the deal and get me some excellent final numbers
he even said he would come earlier if his appointment ended earlier
although our wait time was delayed that is not why i decided to give this place 4stars
i had come into dc auto a couple of years back to get an quote but at the time opted to go with a slightly cheaper place
we finally tried it tonight and it was amazing
i was stranded at a gas station due to my puppy jumping on the lock button and locking me out of my car while i pumped gas
they take time to explain everything to me and my car has been running great thanks to their help and maintenance
contacted store geek squad came out to determine that
shame on them
walked around for 30 minutes
this kindness was much appreciated from beginning to end i was treated with an impressive amount of respect
willing to fix minor stuff for free
picked it up a couple of hours later
robinson is that good
it only washed half the car
motor mounts were not cracked struts were fine
weve all been new at jobs its awkward  i get it
i explained that my dogs are kept in an area away from the cars so that wouldnt be an issue
nice car i told the salesman i was interested so we went to talk numbers
i brought my car in monday morning first thing and found out i needed a compressor
several times my ten year old mazda is just shaking and moaning with age nothing else
great prices on bulk food and essentials
he provided many images videos and answered all my questions quickly and honestly
wouldnt you know it one day late on returning for a refund as i was in the hospital and dealing with cancer treatment issues
francisco was really fast and got to our place like 5 minutes before the estimated time of arrival
ive been taking my cars here since 2011 and i recommend them to everyone
i felt almost guilt tripped
some employees arrived and i explained the situation
i think not
however the salesman zach was very nice the issue with this whole thing was their finance department and their slimy sales tactics
she left her hummer there and walked back to our house only to be called back to the shop no less than five minutes later
are you happy now
plan on being there about 15 hours    that was pretty ridiculous
i like to get my oil changed here and every time i do they wash my car for practically free
i saw he and eddie arguing in my rear view mirror and i didnt think eddie was going to apologize
i will be back to buy from again soon
w a r n i n g
if you need a car go to classic and ask for chris
overall 4 stars from my initial 5 because i dont want anyone negatively affected by this but i do feel my experience was a miss overall
im still saving about 10month and i do not believe the installremoval costs nearly as much as the other place
he says hell get me out in 15 minutes
but lately theyve been slipping in that area
i then had to tell her she didnt need to get smart with me
disappointed that they could deliver on their promises
he came to greet me outside and went right to work on my tire
went to them back in oct 2011 to get my battery replaced  they did it without hesitation
bottom line is that if i trust my car to him you should feel confident doing the same
even the simplest process of filling out paperwork
and the price they charged are 20 less than the other body shop
i could make a last minute reservation without any issues
wife took our vehicle in today for a wash  said she was thinking of skipping it because it looked like rain
stained walls and floors the racks look like they havent been cleaned in years
a statement that they disassembled the front of the engine and that they performed a partial disassembly of the engine which are categorically not true and i will testify to that fact
came here looking for a used toyota tacoma and lamar set me up with the perfect one
if you reserve before 24 hours its only 5 a day
every wash includes a free towel dry by hand to minimize any streaking that the giant blow dryer didnt cover
kevin is a mercedes trained mechanic who use to work at the mercedes dealer
this afternoon i started my car in 109 degree heat and 20 minutes later i noticed my car extremely overheating
but it was worth it to do business with a clean friendly place that gave me a fair price
they called me at 830am to get into the building left a message on my cell at 10am that said they were done
i drove out of valvoline ioc yesterday with a 4625 hole in my wallet even more after pumping gas at the costco next door but it could have been worse
rocks keep hitting and cracking it
jeffs a great guy went above and beyond to make sure i was happy highly recommend to anyone
ive had two propane tanks in my yard since we moved in many years ago but never used it up until now
i will be back next time i am coming through town
black friday here is off the chart
they are definitely different than the rest
our salesman kenneth p was quite helpful but perhaps too assertive
he then went to go get ron
they helped me with my rental and made the process easy
everyone there is amazing and friendly
thank you james for your kindness time and expertise
definitely recommend using these guys
the part is holding up well
was in and out hassle free within 40 mins
was informed that maintenance and any concerns could be addressed at any firestone service center
they told me they needed another hour to bleed the line and the car was finally done at 4pm
it was so much easier then trying to wash him in my tub at home a process that usually takes 2030 minutes at home with cleanup now only took me 8 minutes
in addition the jacket punches me in the throat when zipped up  useless now
again not all that unusual for car dealers i supposeit is what it is
camera works great
i took my nice car to audio express at cactus rd
i guess he forgot he works in salescustomer service
they did a very thorough job
chutima managed to bring dishes that you normally wouldnt find at your local thai restaurant
what a prick
im so sorry for you if you have to deal with them
i see why the aspect truly holds family owned and managed
once they cut your hair they then take you to shampoocondition it while giving you a nice scalp massage
i felt like time and time again i was always paying more than quoted and at 125 hour it can add up over time
they traced the window of the shell
twenty minutes later she said youre all done
this is the only place i have my car washed and i drive all the way from silverado ranch
i told them my problem and yes theres a few things i said that was not necessary to say because im a nice person but i was pissed
i drove out from phoenix to scottsdale dave and his car guy were on their way home but stayed late just for us as the traffic and picking up the vehicle from fairway had us a little behind
big thanks to reggie this morning for prompt and professional customer service
never did i have to guess what was going on
i will never bring my car here again
they are always great
he offered the typical warranty and programs but didnt push back when i declined
i have now spent over 1k on tires on a vehicle with less than 20k miles
allison was amazing to work with and she knows her stuff
they were pretty spot on with the time and did call as promised
when i drove my car it was much worse than when it was dropped off
i dont know a lot about cars but i know they were trying to sell me some bs
they left multiple times each time for at least 30 minutes
welp ive had many many visits to this place for maintenance
kwasi is the man to go to
she said ok thats fine and hung up on me
i didnt realize we had teleported to a different airport
who would have known wed end up buying a car on our vegas vacation
he said they would call me
i take my car to the beachwood ntb at least this location has a 2 star review
it was fate that brought me to brakes plus
dont waste your time with these dirtbags
at about 840am i texted him asking him to let me know when he was outside so i could come out to meet him
there were still tons of bugs on the front and there where lines from where they dried the car and water had ran out but it never got wiped again
i told him that i would never spend another cent here and would inform everyone i know to do the same
quotes from the recall notice safety hazard in the event of a crash necessitating deployment of the front passenger air bag the inflator could rupture with metal fragments striking vehicle occupants and potentially causing serious injury or death
didnt want to drive to the other side of town tonight on low tires
after that got a minimum estimate of 4600
i love blue sky
as soon as i walked in i was greeted which was nice since its hard to come by decent customer service
ive heard cat no longer works there which is probably the best thing to happen to this local business
thanks again george
they told me it was going to cost me more money for them to figure out where the leak was coming from
before they were going to charge me anything derek plugged into my car to see what was wrong
their tint even comes with a lifetime warranty
my appointment was at 530  i showed up at exactly 530 but they didnt actually start on my car until about 7 which was a bummer
mcfalls employees are genuine and sincere
now ive never bought a car straight from a car lot before
weve purchased at least 20 vehicles from yates since the early 1980s
my truck is running like a top now and the ac is ice cold
all great guys
that is a 99 success rate
after another hour waiting for them to give us any offer we left the shop
so all in all i wasted 35 paying for nonexistent insurance and was then forced to spend 85 additional dollars on a car i did not plan to rent
i liked how his employees tried and suggested what to do and it got done
showed up in a timely manner  opened my door in less than two minutes
i have lived all over town and now living in henderson i still go there
i am following behind in my fiances truck
she told me that she in fact did have the attendant redo a few spots
they are not customer focused and not willing to bring any level of customer service after the sale
seemed like a good way to go
i worked with the sales person troy
dont be rude
i am a person who researches everything before i buy it
if you do go here dont order items that you have enjoyed at your neighborhood thai restaurant back home
when i picked up the car in the afternoon he told me that theyd found a broken hydraulic engine mount that had lost all its oil but since it was still just inside the powertrain warranty theyd taken the initiative to go ahead and replace it since they had the part in stock and already had the car up on the rack
who needs this kind of treatment in this day and age
when i arrived they told me they wouldnt have time to get me in for a detail they needed at least 2 hrs and were closing in 3 hours and had someone in front of me
arrival was speedy
it is hard to and a honest mechanic but ricky at japan morors is awesome
my mercedes broke down on a friday in vegas
our tire was a little low so we pulled in to get some air and the gas station attendants said that they could not turn the air on that we have to pay for it at the machine
best self service wash in the area
apparently grady lied to her too
i am totally satisfied with their service
she paged someone for us
he even offered to help me install the replacement light i ordered online this morning if i should have trouble when i get it
body damage not repaired
new one 900 thanks for ripping me off autonation nissan
my car was worthless
would have given them 5 stars but no wifi
wow management here is an absolute joke
initially i was going to take my car to another place but the wait was too long
quite a bit of traffic but he handled it well
i didnt  notice until i got a ticket for not having the decal and went looking for my registration to go to the dmv to get a replacement
but four people behind our already gone
almost 2 hrs of sitting on the curb by my car i figured i should occupy my time and write a review
2 depending on the time of day read after midnight you run into some real characters and by characters i mean drunken morons
i was told another hour
dont trust marcus will never think about dealing with these ppl
thank you scot
it was on the list of places i could have my repairs done
super friendly trustworthy knowledgeable and fast
i check out the paint job in detail and realize very quickly that their are several fish eye  imperfections in the paint job theyve done
my mechanic said the shocks were fine
i dont need to explain my life issues and how i went about receiving an ebt card and i am not ashamed to use one since i dont have a choice at the momentbut let me tell you ive never been so embarrassed
so i would and recommend finding another shop
so because of your incompetence i needed to spend 120 for another night instead of heading home
nice clean site with a great lobby with snacks and toys to entertain the kids
i dont have time for their games and piss poor service
the integrity of the owner really stands out
luckily there were no surprise charges
brought my car here for an emissions smog problem they fixed the check engine light bulb and also helped me with my license plate bolts for no charge
will definitely use them again for future needs
that there only concern was replacing the windshield
absolutely horrible car wash paid 1899 for the works and they delivered everything but
stopped in well before closing
cant you just throw in a second set since we just a car from you guys
thanks for a stressful day i was late to all my clients house because of a oil change
why there s no one called and let me know until i call
when i picked up my car i asked ron for a time and cost estimate for what he was suggesting
this was our first accident so we didnt know what to do and mr warren made us feel welcome and was patient as we asked questions about the general process of dealing with car insurance
been a customer for over 5 years but recently the service hasnt been the same
yesterday i had a screw in one tire that needed to be replaced and it had to be done that same day because i was traveling long distance today
thank you both for going out of your way to get it done for me
i think very highly of this repair shop and highly recommend it
they can work on a wide range of vehicles and have a very good range of knowledge
erik strecker made our car buying experience something i will never forgot
when we arrived to pickup our cars they said we both would have to pay a balance and mounting fees along with installation fees
while i was waiting i was able to over hear him talk to several other customers he was consistent with his customer service and his positive outlook and care
get ready to verify your insurance before asking for a loaner
he talked about life children and football with me and my family
needless to say it is now 215 and i am still waiting now they say another 2025 minutes
so if you ever need a reliable well knowledgeable and really nice service advisor seek out julio because hes awesome and yea once their done with the car they return it washed so kudo to that
agreeing with some previous reviews i wish i could give showcase negative five stars
fast response and great service
the staff was super friendly and made me feel at home
i love my dnn990hd
they come back with the tires are shot and dangerous
this place is the best
quin fixed it without drilling
however i am still dealing with a constant coolant leak that never happened before and my check engine light is on
she was pleasant to work with and we didnt feel any pressure to buy anything
it is right next to the 101 freeway off chaparral exit so its easy to find
we came in today for 4 new tires on the ram 1500 dennis helped us with the purchase great customer service and a smile
told her that she was a negligent mother to drive kids with these brakes
how sweet of them
i went here to get both last week and i noticed i got my perfume stolen and change
steve c ordered it from his local supplier
i later had the same over heating problem i asked them to take a look at my thermostat as well and im assuming they didnt
the experience when i purchase is often very testy between the parties
he said the waiting area was inviting with complementary coffee and mugs
free wifi and snacks available while waiting
such great service and reasonably priced
i actually called first and the guys working there sounded like they were slammed
they do a great job transporting people
mostly everything is on sale and very reasonable
so las vegas weve found a company that values the customer and does a good job
gene is one of those guys
pros  this place has the best selection of used nissans that are within a couple of years old have low mileage and low internet base prices
its off the strip which is a good and bad thing located in a plaza
adrian the manager went back and worked on my car
chapman bmw was a fivestar experience from start to finish
they tell you one set price at the time you leave your vehicle with them
long story short insist on picking a dropoff location before signing on the dotted line
2007 jeep grand cherokee with 79k oem pads
graham the financing guy was cool too and he was professional and patient like david
i wrote to the better business bureau and here is what they sent me
it is not my nature
at first i went to 4 other body shops with good ratings to get estimates and lastly ron
this was our second purchase from hiline garage
wish i could give rave reviews on this place
thanks scott brett in gilbert az
they always answer even letting me know if there is a better time for me to come in for service so i dont have to wait as long
they went out of their way to find a used part to save me some money
sadly one of my tires had a defect in it and again theo was honest and professional
i use these guys for all my car needs they are supper friendly and fast
i picked up on his accent and like so many east coasters they dont jerk you around very straightforward
dont forget to tip yall
im still driving one of the cars 8 years later and you cant see where the repair was done
they came the next business day cleaned my storefront windows and installed the tint in an hour
took care of my car in no time even honored the online coupon although i left it home
i just drove 20 miles here for a bottled water
small place in a strip mall clean and simple
hopefully management will take constructive steps to better educate these two employees to eliminate future occurrences
our car is thankful and so are we
he set up ups to come pick up the defective starter
they pay attention to all the small details as i would if i washed my car myself
he repaired our bumper like an expert
jim was very creative in his repair plan saving me thousands of dollars over a quote i received from another local shop approved by usaa
they are always willing to help you or ask if you need anything
it was like talking to a pillow
review 2016 21 out of 100
oh well it was included
as per the older car that i bought from these guys so far i have not had any issues and the owner even helped me answer maintenance questions saving me money and time
twice they called me that they fixed the problem twice drove the car home and realized that the problem was not repaired
i refused to let them replace the oil pump because i lost all confidence in them
i dropped my car off on a monday and he said it would be done by friday
through the whole transaction he was jovial efficient and acted like he really wanted to serve me the customer
problem is if you dont know where to look or dont care you wont find it
thats the price of a new engine
best self storage facility in town
i asked him how long and he replied  we will get you in in 15 minutes and you will be out of here in 45 minutes tops
now this location in particular can be a little frustrating because its smaller than some of the other warehouses and its always jampacked with people
we tried to sell my wifes ford escort at this location
they will pull the items for me
never got any reply of any sort
all the work is 100 done right
he offered a generous veterans discount as well  which was great
the result was a safe arrival in 2 days from az to ca
i came here because of the reviews and they exceeded my expectations
in todays day and age its nice to find a shop that is honest and reasonable
alex schwinner and elvis johnson really hooked it up with my new 2016 4x4 trd tacoma
they answered questions in minutes during the festival and even had a tech available
i went a couple miles up the street to discount tire and asked them to check my tires
the staff is friendly the vacuum area is really clean  and its easy to get to from the 101 or scottsdale rd
adam was kind and professional over the phone and did not make a big deal over rejecting recommended services
when i got home discovered that old relay has 6 prongs but new part only has 5 tried it naturally it didnt work because its obviously the wrong part
so glad we got a second opinion
we had a hockey game to go to way out in the west end yesterday evening and another hockey game this morning
they were quick at diagnosing a cracked overflow tank and disconnected hose
my vehicle is over 10 years old and i maintain it very well as it is an essential part of my livelyhood
they kept saying this printer was broken and they kept leaving to get cars cleaned
alex helped me and since my car didnt pass because i had just had it serviced they will be seeing me again soon  great and friendly staff
and when i asked to speak to the manager his reply was i agree with you we are the worst tire shop in town and we cant get the owners of the company to do anything or keep tools or parts in stock very poor business
i took my car in for a check engine light and tire light
so i got a few quotes to have my bumper repaired from a few places in town and also sent paul a few pics of damage done to my scion tc
it shouldnt need a recharge
i have told then i bought a car elsewhere and to please remove me from their prospect list that didnt work the calls just keep on coming i think they live by the old car dealer mantra keep calling them until they buy or die yes i was a car salesman man years ago
honest straightforward and professional
i will always recommend sun auto to my friends
check engine light came on my teens vehicle the other day
now we get paranoid in parking in public areas like that i think these people are just waiting for victims to prey on
i came to pick up my vehicle and was ready to pay
i liked that they werent selling or pushy but really just matter of fact in giving me my options from keeping it running and stable to really fixing it up
rocks 76 smog is a scam   do not use
for four people i recommend ordering two of them
he answered all our questions and spent time explaining the car and all of its details
that was the point where i told my sister lets go
hit and miss sometimes the best of service and really get in and make things worth the value and other times just plain half ass
as soon as i drove off it was clear that the car had the same problem and was not fixed so i returned to the dealership and dropped the car off
ive been coming here for about a year and a half now with all three of my vehicles
there wasnt 3 guys with flashlights poking around my car ohh maybe its this
definitely going to be my mechanic
these guys rip you off
that shop on southern and central clearly deserves that prominently displayed sign that reads its not just our work  its our word
i got into a minor accident which damaged my headlight
ive asked if i can return jumper cables i just purchased since they were not opened and apparently i couldnt use them
derek and and yosh were an outstanding team who went above and beyond for me
all the times ive used various car rentals ive never seen anyone having to ferry cars up to the customer rather they direct customers to the line of cars that are available which expedites time tremendously
so i tell him i know what my truck is worth and they arent going to make 8000 and i would be stupid to agree to that
in some cases hes even recommended steps for me to take that would solve the problem without costing me any money
audi las vegas is phenomenal
thank you tom and mosha it was a pleasure doing business with your company
awesome work done on my f150
since i bring my own filter and oil my cost is usually about 1015 less so they give me a break there
fast forward a year and a half our car was totaled in an accident
i did feel like the test drive was abrupt
so much for actually checking an order before calling and wasting the customers time
we appreciate them
this place sucks
i was told 9 pm i arrived at the location with my friend who needed to have her tire fixed
i explained my problem to marie the manager of service king spring valley
this is the best bbq place around
the crispy duck curry is the best duck dish i have ever had in any restaurant handsdown
lets face it buying ralph lauren underwear is literallyah lets not got there but for the basics gym socks gym shorts gym t shirts or gym anything this is the proverbial one stop shop
driver calls and verbally asks me my destination once i told him he shared he was 20 minutes away and that i needed to cancel my ride
ive been a car2go member for months now and i love it
overall this is what i expect from any cstore and especially a qt i never go to circle k
save yourself the time
i said yes he responded by telling me he had pretty much the same exact car with 30k miles on it and it would cost us the same monthly plus it was still under kias amazing warranty
nothing like being sold a car wash to make a place seem sleazy
they could have told me the computer was bad and needed to be replaced
he also kept in touch as he followed by car through the schedulebuilddeliver cycle and when i picked it up gave me a really expert walk through of the various new features
i got really mad at the transmission shop and argued on the phone after the so called experts assured told me i went to a bad shop
ive never had a great experience with an auto mechanic before
laurie hernandez is the most offensive and rude person i have ever known
he personally went over the car with me to make sure i was satisfied
after waiting an additional 2 hours they came back and said that the bulb wouldnt fit into the old socket so they were going to put the whole thing back together again
they were great and would do business with them again
i was told they would use my insurance companys estimate and probably be able to save me 400 or 500
i just made the 5 hour journey from socal to mesa and believe me my car was covered in bugs and dirt
they also almost blew up my car and me in it when they did not install a hose going to my gastank after fixing it
the team here was so respectful followed up with me on pricing and repairs explaining why and gave me options
no big deal but again communication my last 2 complaints i hope to get resolved in which case ill up my rating to 34 stars i paid nearly 200 for tint and they left the clear backing in my back seat
afterwards one of the service techs went out with me to my car to show me how to use the sub and settings my pioneer speakers needed to work properly
the service agent immediately went to wiping off the bugs as i became more and more upset about the poorly rendered car wash  i went inside and asked for a refund
i tried contacting the dealership several times over the past two weeks
great mechanic at a great price   i highly recommend giving him a try
i found center heights on a list of repair shops here on yelp
update so on the return trip we just happened to be walking out when the shuttle was pulling up so no wait
after driving for nearly an hour and a half to arrive at 1 cochran i received a phone call from their sales manager
we told him we had an escalade that we were trading in and that we had just started looking and considering our options
he provided great service
i went in she was with another customer and set us up with mike m so we wouldnt have to wait
anyone who gave this place less than 5 stars is an idiot
took it to a well rated auto repair shop near us
they do not have the consumers best interest in mind
and i might add we got an amazing deal on this superior car for thousands less than what camelback toyota was asking
this was as good as it gets if you love being taken advantage of
this place has no idea what they are doing
i personally dont think i should have to work around their schedule to fix their mistake
for me being a female and having no clue how to do it i appreciate the fact that he went above and beyond teaching me how to do this
the ticket i files through them was undisputed and since their number was not in service i have emailed them
his staff jim benny and brenda has changed very little since i was introduced to pete from a friend whose dad sold him parts in new york
i called this place to get a quote and was on the verge of just buying the part at an auto store and having a shop put it in freddie called me back and told me their price just under 400
i would recommend this place to my friends and family
lets face it a majority of the work done by body shops are insurance and the client is the insurance company
we are busy folks on a budget
perhaps its ct in general thats like this who knows
he said i cant do that best he has is 29 with a coupon
when it was time for me to pay my sales tax like 150 or something tom had a laundry list of other ailments my car had
try them out
i especially like the lifetime alignment as you pay once and get it aligned essentially as often as needed at no cost
scumbag salesman started lying from the get go
i doubt he owns it and clearly whoever does is not interested in customer service
super employees and that cold bottle of water always tells me im home
my car wouldnt start on a summer weekday afternoon and nobody was around to help me jump start it
i left and went home
the original reason for coming in i asked he responded with its an internal code and that would be very expensive to fix
i have been using kyles detailing service for a few months now and he has been nothing short of fantastic
its now been about a month and they said they ordered the parts and apparently theyre coming from mars when i go talk to them now they laugh literally on my face and tell me theyre still waiting
not only did they take me home and pick me up but also were able to schedule my repair right away
completely unprofessional rude and disrespectful
dont be deceived by the number of stars
no they dont dress it up with garnishes or try to make it look pretty just good old fashion good food
then i declined both cars and requested my money back they snatched my bank card out my hand then never credited my money back until i came back and cursed them out
i never understood the point of those but as a kid was frightened by them
charging voltage was low and alternator cable overheating at battery fuse tray
very friendly and courteous people
my money is on the man   and the product
ive lived in the metro phoenix area 40 years and always choose discount tire
not only that but i was the first car there at 730  it took 15 hours
i was a little worried i tried to start my car
sean does a fantastic job his work is phenomenal
great place to take your vehicle
what i found interesting was i contacted one of their direct kia competitors here in the las vegas valley they went and listed all of their options that they would add on they explained what each of those options was and their protection plan was a mere 700 on top of msrp
time will tell if this stuff holds up  we were happy with what we got its better than no tint
i called a different local company and it was 20 cheaper
some people just dont get helping out a fellow biker traveling through
visiting counts kustoms is very much worth the trip
it is nice to have a car mechanic we can trust and is honest with their prices
where to begin
a couple of months ago i wrote a 5 star review for this place
that was the first i had ever heard of such a thing and told them to do nothing and paid what i owed for emission test and failed inspection
i went in to get a part to help me troubleshoot a problem with the stereo
camelback toyota is the exception to the typical car dealership
he was very friendly and we chatted about moving and what to do in charlotte since we were pretty new to the area at that time
they didnt take advantage of me at all
i picked up my receipts gave him my comments and walked out because 40 is not worth arguing over
i felt no pressure to get any extras which makes me want to go back here
i asked the dealer for the inspections that were conducted for hiline garage and it clearly had a recommendation for the rotors and pads to be replaced
i am greeted immediately and offered a water bottle
and she said it had messed up something in her engine
its the same car
im sitting there trying to wrap my head around all of these numbers and im telling him that its confusing he acted annoyed and i say look i know you do this all the time but i dont and im not understanding why youre still not giving me what you said for my vehicle
the other place told me that i needed to repaint the entire bumper
fortunately i was able to get accommodated on monday morning
will be recommending this place to family and friends
i can trust them to be fair  accurate
the guy fixed it really quick and i was glad i didnt need to change tire because i did not have enough time
these guys are always helpful and try to oblige
our salesman don was great
and its super casual all kinda of people in all kinds of dress were inside
yes you give a military discount so an oil change at you place however the stretching the truth of what needs to be done boils down to one of two things trying to make money off of unsuspecting customers who may not know any better to achieve the bottom dollar for your store or mechanics who want to make extra money by spending more time on a vehicle fixing something that really does not need to be fixed
they got it done and on the bill it was charged with an evaluation of the ac system parts and labor and etc but that came to less than 600 so they had some other odd charge and then deducted some to get to that final 600 i dont like that one bit if there is a fixed charge for certain items and labor i dont want to haggle over it it should be what they have in their system
silly us we took it back for them to look at it again
i have never been impressed with their shuttle bus drivers does anyone in yelp land no of any other parking options with good service
when i had an issue with my gtr and stranded in the middle of the night corey and the guys from vault brought the car in and worked hard and diligently on getting it back up and running
this review is long overdue but here it is
i should have gone there
you always walk into body shops a little on guard but these guys are incredible
i bought my new 2009 vw rabbit from these guys
ive never encountered a problem where they didnt have a part in stock the problem though is that az parts are not always up to snuff compared to factoryoem then again youre not paying factoryoem pricesthe choice is yours padawan
the assistant manager jon is a pretty great guy and i enjoy exchanging car stories with him
i usually recommend zimbrick dealers without reservation
i had the interior detailed also
the last time i brought in a cari wanted to have them check out a possible slow leak on one of the tires
went to peoria subaru looking to buy a new 4 door car
sinclair gas is about 2 cents more then the closet competitor down the road
he then stated that they tested the mirror off the other car on mine and it worked fine
lee hoffman has been my service rep for years
my husband liked it but i could feel the car wasnt driving 100
my current 2004 has been performing like a champ
they now get four stars because they are efficient and value priced and honest
you need 60 cents in gas rewards from safeway in order to be close to gas prices at other local stations
more important than anything else i trust thembc theyve earned it
horrible customer service and very dishonest
the finance manager trys to sell me all the bells and whistle
plenty of workers on the corner who will move you for pizza soda and 20
always fix my issues
i stop here several times a week on my way to work
the car worked as advertised and while the price itself was a bit on the highside i felt like it was worth it
they would tell her checks in the mail which was a lie
how do you mess that up
ive had my car detailed both at my dealership and by a mobile detailer and never have i seen the inside and outside so shiny
very good and friendly people
it used to be a whole roasted duck butterflied deboned and then flash fried to order for that price
my previous experience with this shop was excellent so we decided to return
that sounded ok  called my insurance regarding the repair and was told that kustom had actually faxed them the formwithin 24 hours for payment
it was diagnosed here and i was quoted around 700 to get it fixed after a few days to figure out what was going on
the next day i returned the utv to full throttle demanding a return of the rental fee and security deposit
5 minutesmore like wait in your car for 30 min while cars that pull in after you go before you
no call back i call them they tell me they have to look into it
at goodyear i was told i was too early that i still had enough left on my brakes to last a few more months
but it turned out that my condenser just needs a little hosing off
that cost me  one more day at hotel sitting around and wait and one working day to explain my boss my problem
check engine light came on less than a week after we got it back returned to aamco and they replaced the crank shaft sensor
literally again the sales man threatened me at my home with violence
let just say for the amount of money we spent there 100 bucks including tips for all the food this was too expensive
they said call up acura to see if they will replace it
i made sure to speak with the manager by this point and let him know they just lost a big sale
upon arrival the staff greeted me and my mother in law with a smile and the whole experience was phenomenal
these are their tactics
labor costs are the best and you get to talk with the people doing the work
so  with the new alternator in the air conditioner works great
the zaktek paint protection is kind of a gimmick in my opinion basically a wax job and the window tint is debatable since it already comes from the factory with tint per the build sheet
the guys at community tire always do a great job at a fair price
and when i ask what they are making per hour they inform me they are still making 8 per hour
and they guy who owns it is very rude
best place in town
at that point my car was ready and i had to go back to work
i love their clearancesales section they always have plenty of things there for fairly cheap   they offer 10 military discount but that doesnt apply towards clearance merchandise
took my 2008 prius in for a dead battery
so i reluctantly left
i towed my 18000 lbs toyhauler trailer on 2 of the three axles all the way from southern california to the shop in mesa arizona
they hand dry it which is awesome
i would say that the main goal of this shop is to provide quality work and superior customer service
but no one ever took the car out of the service bay or even asked me to drive while they sat in the passenger seat so they wouldnt have understood the trouble i was experiencing
they kept asking if i was happy
there were approximately 10 motorcycles for sale and plenty of knowledgeable sales people available to answer any questions
i decided after reading all the reviews i would give this place a try
weve since learned that memberowned union cab provides better service and has added hybrids to its fleet  we use them now exclusively
it is almost completely clear which should not affect our hoa as it is not reflective or dark in any way
there were people that came in after us and left an hour before us
i did not disclose this to him so i know he did not try to take advantage of me
always a pleasure to do business with this aamco
excellent all around  they had good options on the lot and dug deeper to find answers and other vehicles for me
i took the car in for a third time
if you dont like it we will get you into the car you wanted
the crew is very knowledge in repairs and mike the manager was great
i have known jan for 25 years
i told her yes
i dont go to kobars anymore but thats not due to the service
i am one of the pickiest people around and believe me when i say that joe is really that good at what he does
get in the appropriate lane for your vehicle read the signs
if you need to get somewhere quick probably dont rely on the shuttle as they drop off other passengers as well all over the area
the tint looks fantastic and the interior of the car is noticeably cooler while driving around
this has happened multiple times
well im here to tell you it was a great choice because i enjoyed an outstanding customer service experience with goodyear
when i moved to phoenix a couple of years ago i sought out a local garage to service my vehicle
given the degree of neglect that ive inflicted on the poor old car i felt like it was probably reasonable
had talked to them ahead of coming in to make a deal about trading in 5th wheel and purchasing a motorhome
tony did an amazing job
i couldnt ask for better care from camile and mike lally and how they exceed my expectations and treated me like family
great place great service and honest
especially the art  skulls
i would say they are a little pricey but you get what you pay for
apparently both phones were ready to pickup the other day
i got a second opinion and was told it was not in need of replacement
denver was a referral from a good friend after my ac went out so i called and was told to come in the next day which was a saturday denver took great care of me and took his time to identify the problem and quickly explain the repair
ive never known there to be different qualities of tint
we knew more about the vehicle than the sales person they assigned us to
asked them to help me check a car that i was about to buy off of an asu student who came along with me
fix the machines and keep them fixed and ill change my review to 5 stars
ive never had a mechanic quote me just parts not labor
he comes back in to read off all the current issues
i purchased a fundraiser ticket for 15 that was to provide a fullservice cleaning plus purchased the 8 upgrade based on the sales pitch i received upon arrival
we liked this place but it wouldnt be something i would classify as a mustsee
what do you do
two days later while i had lunch near by they put the painted mirror on for 100
i was even going to be 10 minutes late and when i called up they said come on down when i arrive they had guys waiting for me to get there so they could wash my car some great service
that if dannys was honest with me and told me the actual wait time i would not have when with such a valued package
i cant explain in detail what the issue was as i felt lonny was speaking another language something about rotors and calipers but bottom line they fixed it for a very reasonable price
he did a great job and even on a sunday morning
anyone else try and call them
brought them a fairly basic job of compressing my front springs back into shocks since my small compressors wasnt doing the job
no feeling of entitlement or shoddy work here
excellent customer service
but even if the outcome is in my favor i should not have to go through this whole process  a huge pain in the rear and a waste of time
they seem to be well stocked on alot of things from riding gears casual clothings tools and parts
its not usually busy either
i would recommend anyone steer clear of dealing with him as he does not deal honestly or accurately
vic is professional knowledgeable and extremely helpful in explaining things and directing you toward the right parts to get  which also saves money going via amazon in lieu of paying shop premiums
first of all im not a novice to cars
they set an appointment in two daysway faster than i thought it would be set
i havent checked out the while you wait facilities inside
but when i got there the prices changed
pros variety of tinting options discounts available good service when not the weekend i assume based on all other reviews
this is probably a good thing but if youre ocd like me and are eager to fix just about anything just let them know you understand what youre asking for
to my surprise and with kudos they personally contacted me after my submission to address it
he did not want to give me the car back until everything was fixed and correct
they couldnt make time for me on my only day off i had off they want me to go when it works for them
the problem is with the customer service
i gave them a call took my car in the next day for them to look at and they ordered the parts immediately
i wish more customers were like me and let others beware of what is out there so we can spend our money and time more wisely in the future instead of being called liars and problems and having to deal with us only because we stand up for ourselves
other mechanics could have used this as an opportunity to make a ton of money  but they didnt
5 min after i left the light came back on and so i called them and they said let me call the vw dealer and see whats going on pat called me back who is the manager said oh we put the wrong oil in we used one that works for the summer when its winter the vw requires a different one i was like wth okay so now what he said just bring it back and we will take care of it so i called the dealer and they said im sorry but no we only use one oil on our vw we dont change oils due to weather change then he asked me who told me that and i explained what happen and he said well maam good luck cause they are fool of it so i was angry and i took it back and asked for corp number and he had the nerve to give a different number when i called it it says leave a message so i looked at the comments on the reviews and one kind man left the number on their so i called it and sure enough got to speak to someone right away got a claim number and everything
walter then called me and suggested i take it there
i love this place and so does my car
the buying processes was transparent and straight forward
prices were fair and appropriate
got my car back in a hour and half and its shinning
it would seem my experience was an isolated incident by the looks of the reviews
i went there expecting the whole you need this and that replaced
i dont remember all the names but rich josh mike and the manager lonnie have just gained a customer for life
i made a complaint to the manager explaining the situation
and of course as someone with absolutely no knowledge of cars i had no idea what they meant
i really appreciated the experience i had with 247 easy moving
its a small car dealership but i always bring my car here for tune ups or any car maintenance i may have
the bottom line is that we were given a vehicle that was half a wiped down and in no way detailed like it should have been and we were told it would be
i never receive anything but exceptional service and recommend them to anyone who will listen
its like theyre cordial if youre agreeing with the diagnosis and subsequent cost they come up with
has what i am looking for and need a good majority of the time
he had no customer service and i wasnt even sure who i was on the phone with
thank you for making my day
to be honest the price for the detail is worth twice what i paid for it
staff was super friendlu and no pressure
the inside of this store is always bright and clean the help here is super fast
i highly recommend it and will go back when i leave my plate will be empty and my belly full and happy
they went above and beyond my expectations in repairing the damage and painting
never have left  unhappy with the car wash
horrible person on the counter and it took way longer than it should have to get started with this process
ill definitely use them again in the future
this place exceeds both of those expectations
i was on a busy freeway and there was no place to pull over so i kept going as long as i could at about 10 miles per hour with my emergency flashers on and my heart rate at about double speed
he explained that all of the mechanics were currently working on other customers vehicles and that it would unfortunately be at least 2 hours before they could get to my tire
honesty is a trait thats hard to come by in the auto care industry
its hard to find a shop that can align a corvette
this seemed to catch them off guard
im 100 happy with the customer services i received and love driving my beautiful new ats around town
why isnt there an option for zero stars
everyone is very kind but it is a small team so there was some back and forth getting the estimate and okaying the work so be prepared to be a bit patient on that front however the work they do and the price they do it at definitely makes them worth the small amount of extra communication time
and i said thats your internal problem it has nothing to do with the public
i got my quote and again it was really competitive to the internet prices
meeting some panhandlers during the walk in is just a part of the lotus experience now
i got my truck back the next day as opposed to the 3 days goodyear was going to take
i had to get a ride back to the garage a bit later in the day and the guy said hed be around after closing for a little while in case i had any questions
so my only other card is my debit card so now im out almost 600 waiting for a check from the insurance all because this shop cant read their own paperwork and wont own up to their own mistakes
ive been lazy to have review for this place but yesterday was my 3rd time visiting and i just loved the service here
good deal since they will wash your car every day if you buy the annual package
my car was up chris handed me the bill promptly and i couldnt be more thankful
that was at a dealership and was 900 cheaper than this place
she was a younger white female
on my first visit we discussed and new tire and a price
love or hate a particular manufacture model product or dealer
the crack it made was round and about the size of a quarter and i thought i was going to have to replace the windshield again
i will never own another toyota ever again
wish i could give negatie stars
so my dad called the shop and the lady didnt speak good english and didnt give my father the proper info
david was very friendly and efficient along with the guy changing my oil
the bus ride was a little sketchy
its doesnt matter how much money you spend there these punks are all about the bottom line that benefits them in the end
ribs were dry tasty but needed milk or an extra dip in the bbq sauce which was good
we wont be back
it seemed that i always have to fight to keep the 50 like they said and you could never get in touch with a manager
we have used many dealers over the years
it wasnt until 20 minutes later and i was almost home that i got a phone call from his manager saying that they looked up my account and saw i had only a 5 interest rate on my previous toyota and boy it was my lucky day cause they were willing to match it
you have amazing customer service
i couldnt believe it
there has to be more to the story than what they wrotemeaning a side to the story were not getting
she liked it and purchased the 2013 cruz
i would definitely recommend this place
thats my luck
ill get my car washed elsewhere from now on and pay someone else for a detailing where pride will be more evident
staff is knowledgeable and super friendly
imagine my surprise to find out the thief is actually the owner
i usually go to another small car wash on bethany but decided i would give this place a try since it always seems busy
they are really helpful and professional since i am a woman i have been to places that were not professional and i actually didnt go back because of how uncomfortable they made me feel
jeanine the gm is amazing
i leased a vehicle from them a year ago
ive seen some really great locations
i would never refer a friend or spend my hard earned money there again
also they handled everything with the rental car and insurance
they tell me theyre checking their cameras and that it was all so weird because the guy they gave my keys to knew my name and my car and what was going on
he has helped me find my dream car 4 times over the past 9 years he genuinely cares about my needs and takes time to work with me
in addition i had a 10 off coupon that i wanted to use for the oil changemike assured me that it would all be taken care of
i really cant say enough good things about dynamic imports real class acts
they werent even able to find a solution just simply suggesting try higher quality gas and give premium a try for a few attempts
i rarely post any reviews however i was so appalled at my experience with this business i had to do my due diligence as a consumer and provide future customers a fair warning
they usually will drop this wash down to 46 if you ask which is more than a ten dollar savings
all i can say is wow  that is some great stuff
as you enter youre asked if youve ever been here before and if not a brief explanation of how their system of ordering and their menu workswasnt difficult to comprehend
great service friendly staff and the most important they listen
overall if you need a car dealerships must be used
the dishes came out faster than i expected which was great since we have impatient little kids
apparently it wasnt getting enough water sent to it from the pipe system we had and in a few seconds he fixed it
battery died they werent helpful at all
not once did he help a customer except uson hour four
almost feels like a rest stop
the best thai restaurant in north america
she suggested we take him and put him in the play area
i waited inside which was nice and cold as well as super clean
my loan went through a bank that i have never heard of so now i will need to refinance once i receive my loan paperwork which also hasnt been sent to me yet
not just because of the referral bonuses but because of the professional service weve received for the past 4 years
im not sure if it was just a bad day
im recommending anyone that has a toyota to utilize japanese car service  they live up to the customers expectations
always clearly describes what needs to be done and meets promised times
talk about someone who listens to their customers
superior wholesale tires are awesome
keep in mind i still had my warranty and have a geek dquad membership
bad word travels faster then good
i have had my belt replaced after coming in originally for an oil change not once but twice
i thought the store was bigger at one time
his ego was bruised so he threw a temper tantrum and cost his business 40k maybe more had we purchased other vehicles we are in the market for 2
you wont regret having your work completed here
i specifically told them i wasnt interested in anything else after the counter person tried selling me a bunch of crap i didnt need
at the 25 hour mark i call back in and after talking to 123 people i get told the inventory manager will call me when they get to it
brian was very helpful and got it done quick love this place
ask for their sales specialist the count real name stefan neamtu
keep up the good work and customer service
honest great quality work friendly people quickdont go anywhere else
i thought it was over but later on when i got home i got a voicemail from ken stating that they had looked the car over again and decided it wasnt clean enough and had reassessed the 100 cleaning fee
ryan really took time to understand my goals for both the sound quality and my budget
0 stars if possible
the empty platitudes from heather at dannys corporate that they do a great job for a good price  really
i will never go again to this ggd title services again and will definitely steer others away as well
3 nights later in the middle of the night he car was towed away repossessed by intermountain
i will never ever go back
i would most definitely recommend to anyone needing work done on their vehicle
i gave her a copy of my costco travel rental car reservation
i hate to give this place a 1 star but i have to
joe was awesome
i could hear the engine struggling to turn over and thought hmmmm its been two years since i bought my chevy cruze and it could very well be the battery
i have to admit i was very hesitant at first to come here and purchase a vehicle due to all the bad reviews
this is not your average car washthis is a  classy automotive wash experience
1 the car wash doesnt clean my front end very well it leaves dirt on it still
an honest service at an honest price
the shaving of the break pads was 137
later he was so patient when a deaf woman came in and had to write out her requests
i felt a little bad for the mechanic that had to give me his sob story but i was not impressed at all
its during this time that its damn near impossible to get reservations or get seated before an hour wait but believe me when i tell you its well worth the wait
another auto center failed to help me with my battery issue claiming it was ok low and behold less than a week later it was dead again and i got stuck out in town
the receptionist reluctantly called him and they acted like i was putting them out
i know i can trust rustem to give me a fair price and not add any unnecessary  charges or recommendations to my bill
tony was a lot of help
i know its tempting because its cheap but i priced tires elsewhere but other places are not that much more expensive
there is a police report with chandler pd for this incident
it would have been better just to say 6 weeks from the get go imho
i looked inside of the drivers door again and i guess the manager could see the disgust on my face and asked what was wrong
in other words chris and dennis explained to me what to bring with me ask for etc
seamless process in my opinion
these guys do a great job getting the car clean and usually have a deal going but they need to hire somebody to work the cashier
i always research and know what i want before even going to a dealership and i only have two things in mind when it comes to car buying 1 is to find a car that i wantneed and comfortable of making the payments and 2 if that dont work out i walk away
said hed fix the bumper
as a custom trailer mfgr it is always hard for us to find shops that will work on our units with out knowing anything about the pelsue co our customer will keep your number also in case he needs any other work done
his transmission went out after owning it for 2 weeks
mind you we had been there for at least and hour and a half already
the dishes on the buffet arent overly spicy but theres plenty of hot sauce and dried hot pepper to stir in if you want to raise the heat level
personnel were mature and reassuring
so first thing this morning i called aamco and they said theyd take a look at the car
and for those interest this shop is the epitome of your local small business
when the mechanic came out to talk to me i was all prepared for the upsell
luckily were were given a free week at a nearby rv park which was a life saver as home was nearly four hrs
my sales associate harbir and the sale manager gilbert gave me a great deal
after waiting a few more minutes our order arrived and i will say i think it was worth the long wait
best system ever
my advice is either 1 pray for a good instructor and shoot for a slow daytime to avoid wait times and traffic or 2 pony up another couple hundred bucks to do one of the exotic car school out at the speedway
they claim we have no insurance when we do and they cannot get the information from icbc
the manager was so nice and explained everything to me
he explained things to me was very friendly and even worked with me on the price which turned out to be 286
they fixed the exhaust prob for 20
got right in done in 1 hour
next morning when i could see better under the sunlight i saw watermarks all over the place this meaning that the process they describe for drying their cars in their website is nothing but a show
thanks to the auto tech pj for a job well done
got me in that day and got my vehicle done at a reasonable price
of course the preparation of frying the duck cost an additional 10 dollars but of course the waiter did not know how much extra it would cost and didnt think of asking a manager or something
they give you an appraisal takes about 30 min and they say they give you fair value after all marketing costs etc
wait i thought i was a customer
i just dont get it rips hair out
but this is about our camry
i dont get to praise car dealers very often however the folks at earnhardt earned it with me
they even gave me a ride home and picked me up in the morning
when i walked in the door i was immediately greeted
tom will not sell you partsservices that you not need quite the opposite
um why is this not the main attraction
chris and the staff are all extremely professional they are all about providing the best service possible
cons the entrance to this location only has enough room for a few cars otherwise you get backed up onto a main street
donn normally assists me with my purchases
the manger was nice too i will buy another subaru at camelback subaru any day
i also said i could handle all of the registration and all they would need to do is send the manufacturers certificate to my dmv
mark was professional polite  reliable as heck
he was very nice and helped me out with everything
this is one of the most dreadful sound as you know that this little crack would be growing so fast and you might need a new replacement windshield or get the crack filled up asap
on a nice note they gave me popcorn and a bottle of water but i do not go to a car mechanic to overcharged and insulted
to be honest i dont usually write reviews on yelp but this moving company just saved my life
this is not a review of the line x product itself but of the lack of professionalism and terible customer service
while they occasionally give me recommendations based on my mileage such as all those damned flushes and high mileage oil that ive learned is not necessary  theyve never pressured me into getting anything that i dont want
which is another way of saying get away from us
i highly recommend this dealership as well as mark
ill be coming back for my second car
they brought me an estimate with my comfortable payment amount
foul mouth hispanic worker on the phone that should be working
note that scenarios similar to this have occurred at this location not only previously to me but to several of my friends and 1 family member
this man was told he needed a fluid flush by another store and they would cut him a deal at 300 he declined and wanted a second opinion because that was a lot of money
they should be themselves
and their prices are very compeditive
i was so upset and just left
they were very helpful and friendly
liz was the technician
i took my honda civic here after reading all the great reviews and they definitely lived up to their reputation
sound too rich to be true
he asked if i wanted help changing the light
they found the problem is a minute and i needed new 15 clips and set up appointment that i was 30 minutes late too the next week and he still got me in and out and rebled my breaks to get extra air out of the line too
this is our 3rd vehicle that we as a family have purchased from this dealership
other guy yes you do points to the very bottom of the windshield
and it on took a few hours
it can be hard to spot but i caught it immediately
prior to him talking to me i observed him helping a young lady
after spending 16 hrs at the dealership to purchase a car they finally got it done
you swipe and youre charged by the time you spend using the system
feeling happy and safe jean and family
this is america
well dont knock it till you try it
there was one particular used juke that i was interested in and went to test drive
being frustrated i was a little pushy being that i have a child and an expecting wife
even though it was replaced in 2006 by fletchers sahara location
i will definitely be bringing my vehicles here for service in the future
i picked up a gallon of icee 44 oz  and it is 079 085 with tax
rented a boat with a groupon boat was a pos
you must be kidding
if you have a giant eagle card they always send you coupons for free stuff
they will continue to have my business in the future
the two guys were also very nice to us
i picked 3 stock numbers asked for the window sticker and asked if these cars qualified for the lease price
also i looked into the payoff situation and i was assured that i would be refunded my august payment
now i liked cookie but in when it comes to car salespeople i like it when theyre kind on the lot and then are kind enough to let me go about my life
ive been going there for years and even after moving twice to each side of madison i always make it a priority to have my car serviced there
they are meticulous and might take a while but your car will never look better
the waiting area is comfortable and staffed by friendly folks
i hope that the company reads this review and takes action
bought a used jeep wrangler here a few months back
we were told it would have to go through a 3rd party trucking company and they would be 2 feet off the ground on a flat bed and wed have to push stuff up a ramp
the choice is up to you
sears auto told me that same starter remanufactured will cost 180 and installed will be 330 including taxes
his attention to detail and determination reflect back to a time when people actually cared about their work and not just how fast it was done
i wont go on and on  ill just let the pictures speak for themselves
worst customer service of all time
from time to time i go to other providers to try and save some money
quick to handle everything incredibly friendly and service oriented
do not go to a dealer unless it is free under warranty
donot buy your subie from this place
i was allowed to provide my own parts to avoid those costs and was told theyd void the warranty on the service which i suppose that makes sense should i provide crappy parts
the design of the building and amenities are bit dated
we have rented both motor homes and travel trailers from them
we asked a ton of questions about the car and they were happy to answer them for us
ill be sure to support this small familybusiness again
must get a reservation and do not be late
my ears instantly hurt
a few weeks back my brakes started making a lot of noise and it was hard stopping the car turns out my brake drums were basically useless this was my first time at good year auto service the guys are super nice and theyre not pushy like other places telling you that everythings wrong with it and you have to spend  they fixed my breaks and i spent like half of what others were going to charge me to fix my breaks and that included the oil change and tire rotation i got for my car too now my car stops like a dream and no more noise they are awesome people great service at decent and reasonable pricing
i ended up spot painting my vehicle with professional materials
joe in particular is amazing
no rush no bs just friendly and helpful
my coupon for my tire rotation and air pressure tip off had expired for about a month but mike the manager had me come in anyways and applied the coupon
i know i will if i ever need linex on another truck
my boyfriend was at this store and this was his experience  i bought a ps4 in chino hills california
it seemed fine and nice people
then he takes my keys info and takes me to the desk
thankfully sc has glass coverage which means that you pay nothing out of pocket to repair or replace a windshield
it would shutter every 20 seconds when i was stopped at the stoplights
as soon as you leave their parking lot you can say goodbye to the customer service
she was great
i had two of his guys with me and all three of us spent a good chunck of time walking around my car and they told my what would buff out and what would come out with a wash at one point one of the guys and myself were on our knees looking at the back of my car
it comes with the tire cleaner and a car freshener new car smell is the way to go
i went to enterprise in phoenix az
he also wanted to make sure the right parts were changed and he wasnt doing any unnecessary part changes unless they were needed
an oil change is only like 17 if you check in with yelp and use the 5 off coupon
my car looks like new
he said yes
however the work was top notch
i bought my helmet here
after four hours at the shop and 200 they told me the noise was gone
in fact its going to sit in the garage now for a couple days because its too nice to drive
i was in and out in under 5 minutes
took my car in for alignment and was very impressed with joe and the professionalism of the crew
they stated that my daughter needed a transmission flush and radiator flush
you have to pay
i am so happy that i wasnt able to purchase a vehicle from him
i didnt have a problem with the sales pitch  just politely say no thanks to the extras and they arent pushy
best car buying experience we have ever had
after a day of going to dealerships and not finding anything i wanted i headed there i was approached by clay kling i believe was his name and he was such a great person he took his time with me and really helped get me in that car
i said you know i really need to have a full detail because i had just purchased the car and it had dirty carpet and some minor scratches on the side
after testdriving the car we decided on the a4
we were driving to the dealership called to request him specifically and he was waiting for us when we got there
i agreed to pay their asking price and we negotiated and agreed upon a value for my trade
i was told a couple of things that could use some attention but i was not made to feel like if i didnt get my tires rotated right now my car would break before i got home
cant even believe they let me drive off the lot like thatwent back the next morning and told the service manager vince the story and he basically said it was my fault because i had heavy objects in my trunk
i appreciated that he took the time to talk through the different shades and results
it was closer to 20 minutes and although i was asked if i would like to purchase a muffler tip for an additional 10 because it was purely cosmetic  i was told thisan example of how since i didnt know he could have told me it was needed but did not i declined
yelp 2014 365 review challenge 100 gas before hoes
i have never been spoken too nor treated so ghetto by a person who represents a company that i do business with
monday dec 14 i should have some information for you tomorrow afternoon
meticulously cleaning a windshield and finding that same pin head size chip every time is a testament to their attention to detail or relenting upsell
i arrived at the shop on tuesday 121316 and all bay doors were closed a sign on the front doors said closed and all the chairs in the lobby are gone
in all three case opinions they believe the tech applied to much pressure and fracked the windshield
its clear that numbers and profit are the focus and not the customer which is a shame because theyve lost me as one
unreliable in the most simplistic way
i was a little apprehensive but i was assured the rotor and stains would be taken care of
very professional guys
they just redid the restaurant portion so theres way more room to handle the crazy crowds that this place brings my favorite is the full stack and the pig grits
this is why i shop and get services from local vendors
i went back to the car wash explained to the attendant my issue
his prices were a steal for how extremely thorough he was on both vehicles
i understand a lot of the car buying public buy a car based on monthly payment but when an informed consumer walks in and has financing in place and knows what hisher car is worth and what your car is worth all the monkey business with let me take this to the sales manager back and forth is ridiculous
i found this company on the web and you get an internet discount
up sell  windshield repair is expected at hand wash car clean places
average number of pumps good selection inside right up cochran from giant eagle itself and you get grocery points for pumping here instead of next door at sunoco
luckily my husband recommended i stop by discount tire
very dishonest people
yesterday her cab was half an hour late
with that being said my car ended up doing the same thing a few days later almost causing me to have an accident
they will be our first stop for any future car service needs
im not talking about leather couches a tv and complimentary water in the waiting room though he has those too
i told the service lady i believe there is nothing wrong with my car
i tell him to watch the security camera because i shook my head and storm out
what shouldve been a quick oil change and tire rotation turned into 3 hourmultiple trip fiasco
i needed a new waterpump which is a costly repair
i was in town for a wedding when my car started spilling out diesel from the engine compartment
two words professional and perfection
due to having to order some fluid it took a little longer than expected but steve made it up by giving us a free oil change coupon
i have never had a bad experience with sears auto
the prices were a bit steep for my liking so a purchase i will have to think about
all were reasonable
the work they did looks perfect and the minor issue i had was handled immediately and professionally
a bit odd but we havent had any problems as of yet
they were polite smart and very knowledgeable
this is the best place
first off the price is scribbled in pen directly on his clipboard
i think this is a great idea if you split it with another family member its just me and my husband so these large sizes are simply way too much
i took my car there for an oil change not because i wanted to but because i purchased a used vehicle from acura of peoria and they owed me 2 free oil changes as part of the deal
now i can make it from a to b without looking like ive been in a sweat lodge hittin the peace pipe with d o double g gettin all tribal and shit
kristie is a wonderful person and will save you tons of time
my truck looks like new now as if it just came from toyota factory
make any mention of negotiation a lower price and they will break out sarcasm insults you name it
i called the company to report this and they did absolutely nothing
todd and his team has done it again
this was my first visit to the service department at chapman chevrolet  i am very pleased
the prices are very good and i always get my car back when promised
that was on 921   decided i would cancel before the 30 days because i would not use it that much
went in for an oil change
set your phone to record all your conversations with them
ill continue to drive 30 miles for their service
food is absolutely amazing
we went to cobblestone and looked at my car parked in the parking lot
i left confused
he was able to fix it on the spot without charging me a dime
ask for greg next time you go in to look at a car
jeff is awesome
eddy is straight rude
even though i didnt buy my car here i have a warranty that any dealership can accept
very fast and friendly service
they do a wonderful job
always good service and pretty decent cost
a few liquid blisters right after installation but kip assured me that these would go away after a few days which they did
i didnt use them but there are also vacuums for a fee of 100
i am very dissatisfied with the quality of work
if it wasnt for the negative experience i had when i followed up after buying the car i would have rated them 5 stars
i put it off long enough until i got a notice from the lv constable and had to pay 100 fee
i dont know the location of the magical unicorn tree where mike grows ford dealer parts
i asked her what the name was on the front of the building and all i got in return was a deer in the headlight stare
i was under the assumption that the minor problems needed to get fixed asap but he said that was not necessary and prioritized what work needed to be done and what could wait so that i could fit it into my budget
honest reliable and stand behind their work
she did a great job at getting everyone in and out
good service at a great price
i plan to contact local tv news stations to report this to the consumer help departments as well as other consumer agencies and anyone who will listen
however the customer service is superior and they will always greet you upon entrance
they greet everyone that enters and they are quick with the purchase transations   hence the name
i dont know if i will trust this place with any major service for my bike a simple chain adjustment was too hard
the final product was top quality very comfortable and exactly what i was imagining
crossed our ts and dotted our is with kenneth the finance manager who was just as awesome as the previous three gentlemen we worked with
for the monthly price of 40 unlimited im out hundreds easy
was visiting from out of town when we had trouble with our duramax
their touchscreen meal ordering system was great the 2 liter soda bottles are room temp so its harder in a hurry the ice is cheap and it is overall a great place
three days after christmas my motor went and i was in north field on my way to work
the people do business in a way that is uncommon in car dealerships
why tell me its going to cost 3999 for the part and say you guys dont charge labor or installation but then turn around and say it actually costs 1999
casey who i believe is the owner or manager knows nothing about customer service
as i had a serous doubt about his explanation so i compared two receipts
amazing new business
i got better service at the tlc in california for 10 less
if i need another set they get the business
he told me it would take about an hour and a half to complete the work
do yourself a favor and ask for arnold  he is the most knowledgable caring accommodating sales advisor i have ever worked with
i will file an official complaint with the bbb tomorrow in hopes of reaching even more consumers
i cant even lie i hit so many curbs this year i had to spend money on a set of tires twice this year and my tires run me 200 a piece of coarse i did not purchase the warranty
he didnt want to inconvenience his girlfriendwifemother for the sake of doing his job
however now ive seen how they operate in the long term and have accordingly dropped my rating
from the time i pulled in to the time i left was only 30 minutes
honestly i have no complaints on the work that was done
its great to find a mechanic that treats people with respect and upholds a sense of integrity
this is definitely a gem in the town full of car wash joints
call me an idiot or call me lazy
and i so rudely had to tell the next gentleman i didnt need a ride the same exact thing happened within 60 seconds
i had long wait times only when to ask of a status update to be treated like i was bothering them
so i waited three hours for a part that i didnt need for a year or two in the first place
my story i came in with a coupon for a 1788 oil change and they charged me double that 41 saying that high mileage oil is 9 when i asked why it isnt 29 then they insisted that i was already receiving the discounted rate
well ive purchased a car and know sometimes its a really long process
all they did was take side with the dealer
come friday jack shows up again on time and gets to work
they also showed me that my tires were  in very poor condition
the staff all the way from the guys at the front i deal with ramon to the mechanics are always very nice and to me
lets fast forward to just recently
the little problem was huge cause i first got the car i consigned with my boyfriend they told me oh ok he can do it and its fine but then they tell me he couldnt consign because his credit wasnt good enough and he was already paying off another car
anyway i called biddulph the very next day and left a message for bill and never heard back
five star service
employees clearly dont care
aj is prompt courteous knowledgeable an professional
i made it very clear where i needed to be payment wise
went to look for another honda pilot today
we know what services you provide we know about your carwash monthly plans
we sat around waiting for almost an hour before anyone would even discuss the price of the car or our tradein with us and then the offer on our trade in was insulting
they then noticed my window was about 14 of an inch down from the top the way my car is the door wouldnt close if it was all the way up
always good service every time i come here
definitely not going back again
could be possible major things since i told them i was going on a road trip how come i wasnt told when i had the car in for the oil change
is that a good deal
i wouldnt trust anyone else with my car
cheap car wash with amazing employees
the only improvement would be to have more finance guys as the wait time was above average average when going to financing
hopefully the intention is not to trick the customer by leaving it there for customers to read and if the sales person is so great wouldnt he have more recent thank you letters
i told corey that he knew from the start what i was coming back for
he always makes time and he has good info
when we got out and went up to see if we could help we saw that they were professionally filming the extraction
very weird garlic prawns
im rating the express exterior wash experience
i asked if he would mind telling someone that im having a problem with the gas pump
thankfully 247 rapid discount towing got to me quickly so i wasnt stuck in the heat all day
it was true
after hearing that the repairs would cost 1800 from two young managers whose breath smelled like alcohol i decided to go elsewhere
car was delivered washed and waxed
absolutely honest with you and keep you updated as much as possible
the price was a little on the high side considering the dishes that we ordered but everything was good
i stayed anywaysjust in case
they simply typed in my information and within a minute or two i got an approval from a bank
we checked the value of the car we were purchasing beforehand and the price really did reflect the value of the car which is rare at big dealerships like this
after i checked in it was about 730am i was prepared to stay till around 9 am
this place is a crafters as well as decorators dream and its all at great prices
this is the place which you feel they dont want to make money from you but provide a great service
i believe he might be the only dealer thats ceramic pro certified as well which i recommend applying to any car ive actually even had him do my harley motorcycle as well
i highly recommend 322 i will be placing another order soon
apparently i was mistaken
they drink while working on customer cars
while im not thrilled to be shelling out that much coin for new tires i have to pass my inspection and the folks here were nice about giving me honest feedback about which tires to go with for the price
we had to work on the car to get it back in running order just so we could go home
i have been bringing my car here for service for almost a year now and i have been very happy
i purchased a gmc denali sierra here
nothing special about our visit
most importantly the finance guy loses his commission on the bogus non negotiable rate
joe is the friendliest and most likable person
we will never buy a car here again nor get service there
their are so many hacks and unscrupulous businesses out there that once you have been taken advantage of you become wary of all who conduct business within that realm
sure i get 8 emails and a call about my service appointment which is a bit excessive
cute place good times and great on you health wise
they laugh in the face of customer service and helpful information can be found more readily in the bathroom walls than from one of the people working the windows
dont know what the obsession is with the amount of terribles so close together on charleston is but its a heck of a lot cleaner than the one near del taco
its no wonder why every time i enter it its completely void of customers and workers
there was a lack in communication
if you call one you get transferred over and over with no one seeming capable of helping you
repeated that id like a yes or no answer so i could rearrange plansappointments
after eight hours i received the anticipated phone call and i retuned to sands to pay my 950 dollar tab and depart with my serviced vehicle
i bought it sight unseen from john jimerfield salesman whom i had worked with earlier in the week on a different vehicle
the first time i walked in at 1015 pm
brian and his guys removed tint and replaced it and they did a great job
my windshield is pretty again
the carwash and cleaning is the best around and they always do a great job
when glen heiser from internet sales got back to me i bumped up my offer price for which he agreed
this was a great experience
they advertise all over free registration when you ask for any kind of discount the free registration is off the table
please please stay away
another update 13  look at all the sudden 5 star ratings received in less than the last month
i left the keys with him and went back to work
when i first showed up i immediately felt like i was going to have to fight off the salesmen as you typically need to with most dealerships
id been shopping around for a new used x5 for about 2 or 3 months and never purchased a bmw in the arizona market
they put fresh green thai chilis in it so it is a very very spicy dish
why go somewhere else when they are the best
they are blaming the noise on hubbearings
jorge says i cant give that for free youd have to talk to the manager
he did request someone come and assist at this time but i had waited long enough
little less than a year ago i bought a 2013 elantra from these scumbags
sure jayco has a 2year warranty but who buys an rv to keep it in the shop instead of rving
im not sure how this place got even one star
worst experience ever they are slow unprofessional and did a very poor job
i tell him calmly sir i was here before her and he cuts me a look and says im talking to her
very friendly and open family atmosphere and then theres max
rick is very fairly priced and he is open to suggestions and willing to make modifications with you until you have your vision complete
samir was my sales person and he was very patient and up forward with us
quick turn around with great consistent customer service
their online credit application was broken and i emailed and called twice about it
scott mccoy used car mgr immediately took action and had the car towed back for repairs
despite this experience i would not have written this review if not for the fact that the guy who had been working on my car walks into the reception area and slams my keys down on the counter clearly upset
steve shannon is a pro
i went back to justin and asked him i had to have lisa as my service tech and he said no he would help me
plus they gave me new windshield wipers and didnt charge me for the windshield
i dont know how they got the 12 star they should be happy to get that gift
they will be forced to respond soon enough
i would recommend this place to everyone
the only drawback to this one compared to the others
great work quality and very reasonable prices
rent from hertz or avis and save a lot of
its now running great
since most of the marine dealers do not do on the water repairs its up to the customers to take it on a shake down cruise to check it out after the initial repair
avoid this autozone at all costs i dont care if its 24 hours im never shopping here again or auto zone for that matter oriellysnapacar quest  has cheaper and better quality parts and waaaaaayy better customer service  anyways
all in all with the extra charges i may as well have paid full price which is fine because they do a good job
taylors just earned themselves a very loyal customer
being that it had been a while since i actually had service i got the air filter that was suggested and had my fluids filled
booked my appointment with them and than got cold feet because i thought they might be pulling a fast one
the crew was very kind and friendly
so i added that to my service
made the vegas experience the best in 40 yeard
low pressure the offered us the usually addon such as warranty the price for was fair and unlike most they list what is covered in writing and not just lip service
dont worry cesar ill go ahead and upload the receipts from your amazing work
it really only took that long because we were talking about other things
and the good ol four square and rocket pen trick
but then bam they smack you with a over priced piece of crap
he got there at 10 and i was 2 minutes late wow
just remember the numbers 69 and 77 they are open from 6 in the morning to 9 pm monday through friday and open from 7am to 7pm on saturday and sunday
however the prawns were big and very tender
they have helped me with my ac as well as a radiator that blew
it could have only have been where they had checked the brakes
the brake light went off and brakes feel great over a month later
cashiers are always friendly  so is the people who check your receipts when you walk out
im not suggesting a bait and switch
its now fixed and only cost 300
i emailed him photos that day contacted him many times went back to the station and got the run around even though the tape clearly showed the damage was due to faulty equipment
my husband and i bought two vehicles from prestige on centennial
if i didnt have integrity id be able to just take whatever the hell i wanted
use this place at your own risk and know the owner will not accept any responsibility for their equipment malfunctioning
i paid for an alignment that they obliviously didnt do ruining the two new tires i bought
he said to bring it on in and he could check it out right away
if you want a place that doesnt honor appointments or that doesnt keep you updated on your vehicle bell tire and auto service is for you
he helped me without taking anything from me for his time
free inspections and courtesy codereads for dash lights and warnings
i have 3 hds a 46 74 and 79love old bikes but the do need regular maintanence
im mad about their customer service more than anything else
about 75 of them needed rework within the first 100 miles
this is a true hand car wash your car will not be scrubbed with a mop and ran through a machine
why offer express if salesman gets mad when you dont upgrade
they claimed to have found a problem in the wheel that had to be fixed to pass inspection
because i know practically nothing about cars i appreciate how you can bring your car to discount and have them check your tires without an appointment to make sure everything is ok also when i have had to bring it in they have always been very fast and the guys working there do great customer service
will definitely be back
take your belongings doesnt mean steal your customers belongings
one dealership wanted to me to pay 500 for floor mats and window tint for a used car
he walked me over to the sale section and showed me the offering
but after assurances that the price we agreed on was the final price 1600 added as a last minute fee really pissed us off
also there is limited parking
while i was driving away a junkie came out of the office and hid behind a parked car while two other people went into the office looking for help
the guys there are men of their word and stuck to the original quote even though it took much longer the end result was a very clean install and a great running truck
they havent begun to see it
just goes to show that this is a place where they care about quality
this is the only place i would bring my car to get serviced and i have recommended a number of people to tom and his staff
as i said my car is 20 years old and chris and spud did as good of a job as they would on a brand new car
thats great but it was not in my budget and you cant convince me otherwise
i wish to especially thank mark and dustin who go the extra mile if not for them and all the staff at the rest of their locations i would have been at a great loss of what do
after explain to mike multiple times that i would need to go through riverview for reimbursement he told my wife and i that we needed to come to the dealership personally to fill out the forms to apply for reimbursement
i am absolutely blown away with everyone that was working that day
after you work your way through the standard auto wash you pull around to the area with vacuums and are finally able to get out and go to the waiting area
i always kept up with maintenance like clockwork
really now its creeping up to two months that this shop has had my car and keeps giving me the run around
my wife and i took her honda crv in to tint all 5 windows and the service  its amazing
beware of false advertising
good customer service i thought what i wanted was out of stock but before i got back to my car one of them came out after me and because they had found it right as i was leaving
they were supposed to call me when it arrived i was a serious buyer and guess what they never called and never emailed
we also had a chip in the windshield which was billed directly to insurance with no deductible or increase
they were still working on it
never expected to come in for service and come out with a new car
beer does not quench this kind of spice
efficient courteous and helpful staff
show me that you care about me and i know you will take care of my car
good for them
the next day i rent a car so if the inspection was good i could go to bank and get the sale going so at 4pm i texted kennys phone saying i will meet him at 5pm well i show up at 515pm i called kennys phone number and was told he would be there in 20min 20mins nothing 30 min nothing 45 min nothing so i called back againthe person on the phone says that kenny forgot about our appointment and he is doing a brake job and the guy said wait at the address and kenny will call me back
they stated that they would replace the 34 shift solenoid and they would check out the solenoid
when they did a full inspection for my oil change at no cost when i got to the dealership he had the audacity to tell me the full inspection would cost me 290 plus tax
they are honest and their customer service is top notch
people who cant eat too spicy food be warned i can handle pretty spicy food and the dn were surprising though good
this place dose not do detail work
we will be taking our vehicles back when we need to and will recommend this place to family and friends
good job on my smoke lights speakers and buffingsanding my headlights
my truck was long past due for some maintenance as it had been parked for over a year
usb enabled as well as traditional outlets
my advice is if you are going to buy a car here be crystal clear about your wishes and get everything on the paperwork
drunken noodle chicken  pork pad seew entrees the noodles in both of this out of this world
i will never come back grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
one stop shop here
by this point he was getting very hostile and irritated
i also need a brake overhaul and a frontend alignment with tierod ends tuneup and transmission service
they said they checked it out and it wouldnt fit
thanks to a friend this is now where i take any issues with my vehicle
respects the customer
tony did what he said he would do and kept me informed of progress
my whole family has been going to black wrench automotive for probably 8 years
went to have my vehicle inspected which isnt a big issue at all
are there really that many coupons floating around a year and a half later
i always come here for my oil changed  they always i mean always accommodate me
it looked just like it was driving off the car lot in 2009 absolutely beautiful
luckily i simply look up and there reads a sign to the effect of start here so i did
im sure they are very capable mechanics
having changed my share of spark plugs back in the day i knew there had only been 2 plugs installed in the engine once when it was assembled and once at 103000 miles by my local honda dealer in columbus ohio
he explained everything throughout the process and made me feel comfortable signing the paperwork
i worked directly with a gentleman named jeff and he displayed the commitment to make sure i was satisfied throughout the process
he was neat in his work
i called her back on tuesday after a bit of phone tag and appreciated her recommendations and politely declined
been using them for over a year  very accommodating very friendly and helpful and very very professional
unless youre pablo escobar rip don pablo go to a local small shop like garys
he personally called to apologize and make the situation right
he even took me back into the bay and showed me what was going on with my dirty brakesand a free tire rotation to boot
ill probably be back in a few days because i want to try their crispy duck
he then tells me that any other tow company would charge hundreds more for this situation the vehicle would have to go to their yard and storage fees on top of that
he is honest direct straightforward and most importantly he cares how your vehicle runs
and this has been 26 years
i only took off a star because my car is still making the grinding noises other wise because its a mobile shop they come to you
i will definitely be a life long customer and recommend this shop to everyone who needs any type of work done on their vehicles
when i got my car from theo all i can say is that wow
he then made this statement oh the ink from the printer must have run out and didnt print it
i scheduled a visit and took it in one morning before work
i reiterated many times that i did not want to do business with wells fargo due to personal reasons
reasonable fuel prices and cute desk girls make this a complete fbo experience
you either like it or not
putting a hold on my cashiers check from a fellow shared branching network credit union was asinine and unnecessary
it wasnt working anymore but it was working perfectly before the accident
i choose the 14 wash then you pull up to pay cash or credit you stay in the car for the wash then youll be directed to drying area
its worth it
im doing overnights and my wife is driving days
my girlfriend and i had heard an advertisement on the radio about these great deals that centennial toyota was having so we decided to go check it out
i wasnt even trying to negotiate with him or haggle
this had to do with the abs system
the gas is still 18 cents or so cheaper if you can get to the south carolina border but if youre here in charlotte this is the way to go
will recommend capital tint to anyone who needs tint and also interior detail
they saw me and worked on my car like a nascar pit crew
so right on both counts
i would definitely go back here if i ever needed another car
a consumer should not have to wait 45 hours and then be treated like a liar
this just isnt something you want to hear right off the bat considering i had driven all this way under the impression any repairs would be covered
for company snack runs its perfect
thats the scam and honda west does this with approval from the management
i finally agreed after the manager said that they would give me around what i was asking for in cash
i went back to earnhardt and got the car i wanted at a better price with the financing bell didnt wouldnt offer and a better deal on my tradein
zero pressure zero bs
the only reason im giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they will let me come in for a free doover
i called to see if they could replace my battery and they said yes come in
here is my story i took my car for a oil change and a tire rotation sometime in june of this yearthey rotated my tires  and when doing so commonsense they tighten the lug nuts with out a problem ok here my problem i took the same car in for a oil change and same tire rotation on 102914 but now the lug nuts are so tight they couldnt take them off the mechanic advise me that the stud will beak at this point i said fine break it a stud doesnt cost that much to replace so the stud did the opposite and didnt break it got stripped insteadso now its my fault because i give them permission so now i have a additional fee of 10900 to cut the stud out i told the mechanic if they didnt over tighten the lug nuts the first time we wouldnt have this problemthe mechanic told me that all nissan altima had that problem thats a load of bull
i recently bought a certified preowned lexus is 350 from these wonderful ladies and gentlemen
thanks jon and the legends team
my family and friends have come here for years buying bikes and apparel
i am ready to vomit on the sales floor at friendly ford
hard to say why this is but it may be that auto repair selects for rather roughhewn guys
they tend to be somewhat expensive but then again they are not scratching your car with machines
portions are super small therefore rendering the prices to be pretty expensive
i dont understand why they dont
this place is fucked upi called 10 times to make appointment for oil changeno body picked it upfinally someone picked up and tole me that i dont have to make appointmentso i came in from sw about 30 miles awayand the lady told me that i have to wait 2 hrs i i dont have appointmentcome on nowthis is the worst dealership i have ever been toi got my evo here bc they are only the dealership in vegasdont deal with them
he stayed in contact with me throughout the process and continually updated me on any detail that he received
having just returned to las vegas for a quick business trip early this week i had to make a few visits to some of my fave haunts when i lived here
i was treated well and everyone worked hard to get me in and out and they did not seem to be bull sh
the service tech was very nice not the cold i hate my job kind of guy
but its ok i came out pretty good
from her its the old ill honor what i told you and will fight for you
10 minutes turned into 1 hour of me waiting there with no update
i was showed a dirty cracked damaged sensor
i got the actual value of the car
buying a jeep from this dealership has been the worst purchase ever
he called the store and as he was explaining what was wrong was placed on hold while talking
well 522 later they said it was fixed
it seems that my review is pointless as a majority of the reviews for this place are terrible however i feel strongly enough about this to post it anyway
i went into dana brothers because i had a dummy light coming on
they seem to have a better group of mechanics anyways
i told the dispatcher and the driver that my two back tires were flat and that they must use a flatbed truck
the dealer would have overcharged me
they should do the honorable thing and accept the certificates and i am considering reporting this to the attorney general
well  the tires are still pretty new and i will definitely bring it back to the shop where i bought it to see if they will give me a new one
i went to sunbelt auto thinking my car needed hundreds of dollars of work
so when i called the manager austin called me i explained what happen and he tried to tell me they shredded my information when i told him i never sing the documentation he said what could he do to make it better because he didnt want to lose his job because what they did was illegal
of course for this event almost all of the cars there are the bmw 3 series
they cared about me and my car and have made a regular customer in return
he also resolved two recall issues and i appreciate that
neil is always the utt most professional i have ever dealt with
do not waste your time
i was met by a salesman named shawn gold
its very important to me that a shop is honest
heres your sign
they lost our business
they end up telling me that the same girl carla who i had been speaking to has no idea what car it is makes no sense because she was obviously capable of giving me a price but now has no idea what car it is
transmission is running smoothly but there was another situation that arose
if hes the first one out its usually because of vacation plans
and just told me flat out it was going to be 23 hours wait she didnt even ask what i needed done
they make you feel comfortable and at home
when someone came they greeted me then said to wait for someone else
i love moquino he has always been able to fix body issues on my car
ok the bottom line is that mr chang you is honest and fast and honest and knowledgeable and honest
if you work from home like i often do and are constantly getting large deliveries they will accept packages on your behalf and put them in your storage unit with your permission of course so you dont have to drop them off every time one shows up on your door step
where to start
you wont regret it
recently i needed to get my shocks replaced
we needed a brake job on our ford expedition
how many of you have heard this line  you know the average repair bill on this car is 3000
i think its embarrassing that things have to be taken to yelp to have someone high up resolve the issue for you
im sorry about the inconvenience
if it wasnt for the lifetime alignment i wouldnt be here
the warm rice with the beautiful fresh sweet mango was a great combo and  add in a cold bite of the coconut ice creamthe perfect ending to a great meal
the lady whom i spoke to was very kind and setup an appointment for me within minutes
i definitely am going to use him on a regular basis
have a good day now im going to crack a beer
they honestly appear not to care at all about customer service
i came without appointment and they were able to accommodate my repair
ordered some spring rolls for my daughter who likes basic asian food  shes boring but i love her shes a pre teen so dont hold her food tastes against her yet
my car had trouble starting so i took it to desert car care down the street from my office to get my battery tested
service at the parts counter can range from informed to clueless but usually they have competent help here
before we even see any paperwork we are told we have to come up with 4800 more in cash or the deal wont happen
you wont find a better more trustworthy shop than bmw only
then the finance manager was nice at the start but got very upset by the end
this is the second superior tire that i visit
if you dont mind waiting and at this time of year you will wait you will find a great deal on tires that will fit most anyones budget
its pretty sweet to say the least
i didnt really like the sales manager he was too pushy
not bad not anything stellar to mention
there is plenty of parking and theres a path with railing right next to the lake so we could walk along it if we wanted to
it was half the price what the dealer and another shop quoted me
we called vince at the summerlin location and he was absolutely awesome and handled the little issue we had with a product we bought
so i rescheduled to go back in to have these corrected
even though we were late in arriving they got us right in
they were able to work with me on my pricing down to the smallest details
every other honda dealer wanted  first before taking a look
its that time of the year again car registration renewal
went back to volvo am i for a maintenance check and the second visit was as positive as the first
thanks guys i really appreciate what youve done
good people and good service
not really drove to work the next day and it was overheating
jacob white was my service advisor and he maintained communication with me throughout the process
oh and they always call at bedtime for my kids
i think to myself i knew i wasnt crazy
the company is out to make money and only money
had a great experience with discount tire
if you want to have nathan the owner work on your car then head up to the scottsdale location and his wife jennifer will check you in
i also got my tire changes here
they basically made fun of me and charged me a couple hundred dollars to get on the road again
but once we took our first bite after it had come out hot and fresh most was forgiven
and it surely was not flat before his first trip through the crappy car wash when he went inside to complain about the tire situation the lady said what do you want me to do about it and that there was no way the car wash did it
having a service that can come to you and delivers a sparkling car wash is amazing
i found two shops in phoenix that i felt comfortable with and who would do the job for about the same price as kobars
i wonder if ford doesnt pay the dealerships to fix rattles so they play dumb
costco has been good to me
i came here specifically for the optical services
they once greeted you upon pulling up and got your information and service you are needing
this place is soooo great
tried to get a temporary movement permit from nv dmv but cant do that without the car being registered initially
it when it does happen and believe me it will you want to make sure you call the right company that will not only come in a timely manner which is important when youre in the side of the road waiting but also one that will be professionals and take care of your car
given the heat warm days also make the contact more slippery and require longer to form a tight seal
went for the first time today for some work on my 1983 gs 750 the service and the price was awesome
if youre considering a vw look elsewhere
for sure i will visit toms thumb in the near future
live and learn
took the suburban back in due to ongoing mysteries
yesterday i drove to the jiffy lube for yet the 4th time since all the trouble
scot is the real deal
i heard that the price goes lower after summer but i couldnt wait
i dropped the car off for the headliner repair and was told it would take less than a day
he got glass cleaner and cleaned it for me

ill wait another month for the staff to turn over and then ill try them again
i called back spoke to jeff and said nevermind hes going to do it himself
let me start by saying that they are open on sundays
but holy cow i was quoted 8900
upon arrival 2 hours later lance was on top of the situation
i stopped at this discount tire when my low pressure light went on
well almost
i ordered a set of staggered 20 rohana rc7 wheels tires and tpms sensors for my 09 g37
had to slam on my brakes and skid into other lane
the was was great employees were enthusiastic
can u imagine having to lean to the middle of the car to be able to slightly see to drive in the rain
i bought my tire on their website which was very user friendly gave me options and was very clear and upfront about what my outthedoor cost would be
i walked in and immediately walked back out even though i really had to go to the bathroom seriously bad
would not go back
pretty good deal and the quote is comparable or better than many other establishments around town
if you live in or near lakewood its a nobrainier
naively and obviously not being familiar with cars as the svc mgr mark thomas describes his crew as highly skilled and trained individuals as all our mechanics are  svc writer tony munoz also said my gas tank has been recalled and we can replace that for you
i did not get to leave that day with the vehicle i wanted i am one picky b so they had to locate the color and one with the interior i wanted which was found in california
it was close enough to keep me happy
i feel that i paid about 6070 more then i should have
another individual came out who did not introduce himself
theyve got to be doing something rightright
first he hung up
there staff is incompitant and rude
team ford is truly a team
the cc is a lot of car
very fair and reasonable with the cost of their services
look somewhere else
id recommend this shop to everyone that wants great and friendly service
not once did i feel the upsell push to buy more then id intended
sounds crazy doesnt it
aaron took great care of my car and did an amazing job
elwood body works is class act place
after paying the deposit we waited for a day and a half without hearing back from them
it had just been replaced at the dealership and they were giving me the run around
car was done in a little over an hour
ive been taking my ford escape here for years after getting poor service from the local dealer
they always get the alignment done in less than an hour from my appointment time
im going to keep a close watch on my credit card for funny hertz charges
however brian went over and beyond in making sure that i would have something to use
gary running the front office was awesome
they gave me a rental car for a week until my car arrived
the manager didnt even show up until 740am
i contact the mechanic who says to bring it back
or find a hotel shuttle and take it to the event
i recently bought a honda accord from metro motors and was very satisfied with the experience
price seemed to be fair
he kept the bike running in top shape for 3 years
if your lucky enough to get ron as the guy who details your car  it will be the cleanest your car has ever been great job will definitely be back
we did not book an appointment but rather just showed up
my factory hood pads are worth 100000 so i filled a police report for grand theftthank god i shipped with fedex and received confirmation they received them
what a joke
the coconut lemongrass soup is real tasty
they will scam you
very knowledgeable and very trustworthy
he told me to pull forward and that they would do my car since i had already paid
bought a new cooper tire in november from this big o we had a flat from the freeway yesterday so took back for the warranty but they did not honor their supposed 3 yr warranty because it was not a big o tire it was a copper i had my receipt also
i first found vinces on an emergency situation
most of the van was well cleaned but they missed vacuuming the entire rear storage area by the lift door even though they had the door open for wiping the interior
now i know what order i should get things fixed in
s response is the usual cut and paste response left for all of the unfavorable reviews
that was huge
having listened to davids explaination owner of the shop i decided to let him do the work
this is the place
this was my second trip back in to the office to get something fixed
would also suggest having a reservation this place is always packed
so i will be taking to avondale mitsubishi were i purchased the car from and they will be not charging me to fix my car and will have a loaner waiting for me and no charge
ive never been treated like this
it looks as great as they day i picked it up from the showroom
i wouldnt be surprise if this place has roaches
do yourself a favor take your money elsewhere
we then filed a claim with the police department after them confirming they did not take anything into evidence like all citys employee matthew tried to make us believe
mechanics sent me here  so if they trust them you know its good
sometimes i pay asking price
they showed me under my car and stepped me through what the problem was and how they found it
again a lesser value car for 100 more a month
but i told him i had to report it so he charged me full price of 84
very un professional
i will continue to bring my vehicles back here
thank you to the whole sales and service team you have made my experience amazing
i understand that vehicles depreciate in value but 50
so if you have transmission problems at least here you know theyll fix whats broke not what pays them the most
they did not have the part that was needed to fixed it that day so they give us a car to drive in its place which was nice
this shop has not only been working on my car for years but everyone in my family and all the cars at places i have worked
love this place
this made sense to me
highly recommend for any time you want great food service and a view to remember
i went here about six months ago or so to get my brakes serviced and part of the package purchased included a tire rotation
fried prawns crispy and they also fry the heads so they are like chips sweet and sour chicken i think this was my least favorite
system totally dry
they rotated my tires and improperly placed the weight when balancing the tire
ill admit  im an asian soup noodle guy
i have taken my navigator 3 times to this dealer
das ganze auto war nur mssig sauber
avoid this company
process the wash occurs in several stages
this information was provided to me by janice whom works at the office
these guys are professionals and take pride in their work
we bought our new 15 odyssey van via costco auto sales at this dealership and i am so thankful that we did it this way  set price zero haggling literally no stress or pressure
after around an hour or so i called back to inquire
continued thank you for everything you guys do
i love it
in summary unnecessary service is pushed above average prices below average waiting room and above average waiting times
we drove up to the car wash pullthrough and were quickly greeted by an attendant
rami came to our rescue
i got my car battery from here less than a year ago  it already died out so which means they probably gave me a used battery its been a week and a half ive been trying to call and get a hold of them
if you want a bmw and you think you can not  i just got a 2015 328
old banged up cars41000 miles on the clock
dont quote me but you might get a discount with cash payment
he found my next red camry completed most of the paperwork prior to my arrival gave us free lunch and made everything really painless
also save your receipt bc they check it after the wash the cashier should have mentioned that
luckily busy bee wasnt too far down the street and i was in and out in about 15 minutes and it only cost 15 to patch the tire
cost is roughly 1 per minute
i definitely recommend this shop to anyone and everyone that needs anything from tire work to heavy mechanic work
within 5 minutes shane was there
before i left i had the gsm write and sign a letter saying the car was in their possession
im in the process of suing the company
the cs rep spent the whole time huffing and puffing
i also came here for my state inspection this year and passed without any problems
i took my car here because it is close to my house
both my girlfriend and i only come to this place to get our cars washed
they have an onsite dump station and propane right there so in reality its a one stop shop for everything you may need for your rv
not only did sun devil auto fix it for under 100 bucks they discounted the labor rate to what they actually spent fixing it not what the book says
they will say that the diagnostic check is 150 and if work is done they will take the 150 off
it was something small and simple that he absolutely did not have to take the time to do but did anyway
he snapped at her and she got off the phone with him
the service department is terrible the most simple repair takes forever
i purchased a vehicle the end of october 2014 and now still dealing with crap from these people
no big deal i thought
plus the estimate was free
we took it in to hoehn infinity they said it was a mess and they would not work on it
come on  the truck isnt worth that much
david tried to jump the car and get the starter going
in fact she asked him to but he patiently explained that the way her car failed the test it probably wasnt a bad converter
called another place and they only want 50
they didnt just spray fragrance to cover the odor like some car wash guys do
he was very knowledgable about the cars and not at all pushy or pressuring me to buy
they stayed late to get everything finalized for me and honestly just took really good care of me
on the plus side the waiting area is clean and everyone was polite
i know that i will always get outstanding affordable and honest service from dutchs auto
the slaw on top was so dried out it was basically cabbage
i couldnt believe everyone else wanted to charge me almost 100 to tell me i needed a new battery
it was worth every penny
crunchy spicy and good but nothing to write home about
mike prioritizes the work for you so you can space it out
he said oh the test is universal  blah blah blah and its going to be the  same every  where you go
my car looks brand new
my whole saturday ruined because of their inefficiency and miscommunication
i can honestly say that i have had a positive experience every time i come in
in a nut shell there is correlation between cost and quality
only used them for a quick car wash because it was close
i had my entire house tinted satisfactorily by these folks 8 years ago with a warranty which implied if i needed to have them retint a window they would come out measure estimate and for a fee  replace
used to be fantastic and i went here all the time but now its awful
once we had some questions ted journiette took us out on the lot to take a closer look at the elantras and sonatas
i took it back the next day and they replaced the fuel injector rings at no charge
the buffet was just ok2 soups the beef noodle was tasty egg rolls chicken curry pad thai white  fried rice salad fruit and a few more items
my credit is spotty at best and we were still able to work out a deal
its so maddening to think of the amount of money we paid for a vehicle we trusted to be reliable and its been nothing of the sort
we were picked up  on time and taken to their facility the disappointment started once we arrived there
im sad i didnt get the drivers name but whoever he was saved me so much trouble an money thank you
i love martins auto repair
i like the stuff but i think i will find online from now on
this was the easiest car buying experience i have ever had
if you looking for inexpensive tint and rims come see rigo and ricky
and pray to god that the judge actually has some common sense left in him
unfortunately this time my check engine light was on and i failed the smog
if youre looking for a cheap and honest place definitely check them out
i highly recommend
i specifically asked about the other mounts and i was told they are fine and i do not need them replaced
impulse shopping on steroids thus blowing the savings of bulk shopping right out the waterbut its fununtil you swipe the cc
away i drove extremely upset that i had driven 35 miles to get my oil changed and wasnt even offered a discount on my oil change
teilweise auch schon mit vorfreude ob meine wette gegen mich selbst dass wieder jemand neues da ist gewonnen wird
very nice folks
i already filed a police report on them
thank you so much for the staff and wonderful service for my birthday
i find the first person you talk to a waste of time as all the dealerships do this
i disagreed with him on charging the 3 on debit card and informed him that after sept 2013 it was illegal to charge an additional fee on a debit card
from the reception to finance to service to sales and even the gm theyre all great
i will send them the contact information of the other shop to refer all their east valley clients
just giving a quick thank you to jj garcia our salesman after having spent the last few days doing the car shopping thing and dealing with far to many salesman that didnt know their cars very well or seemingly uninterested in helping me he was a breath of fresh air
just had jimmy at my house to open a locked iron bar security door that i lost the key to
inside is bright clean a different world just like he said
the service was quick and professional
all of the staff at hertz car sales were very friendly not pushy and very relaxed
the shipping was not reimbursed either
my boyfriend and i went in today to buy our first used car together
rented this car through carrentalscom
this was the worst car rental experience ive ever had in years of travel all over the world
if you go therei recommend only ordereing from the northern thai section as that is their specialty
they have a very good selection for all the models
and that means a lot in an industry known for its sliminess
andre the owner and technician joe personally met with me in the shop after a thorough inspection and i was able to examined the vehicle together with them as they addressed my concerns
turns out it was sooner rather than later
customer service in a business is hard to find in todays economy
we had phad thai green curry and some soup which was a mix of coconut milk and spicy tom yum like soup
they were recommended to me by my insurance company and i could not be more pleased
come back the next day and its the same thing
just wanted to give a thumbs up to the nice man who picked me up on 107th ave early wednesday morning
i never go enough to get a package but im sure its worth it
why are train stations always so cold even although they have an indoor waiting area
changed them  too
another great night with the fam and a meal with garlic prawns chilean sea bass pad thai fried chicken wings
i bought an r1 from matt and always had great service
yes he did up sell replacing the serpentine and one additional belt but my husband felt that it was worth it since my honda is 10 years old and still had the original belts
his saying which i happily steal  the deal was great
the staff at this particular store are more helpful than other locations and will actually approach you to offer assistance
after my yelp review i received a call
i have had all types of maintenance done from oil changes tire rotations filter changes 20k miles service and etc
we chose bell toyota because it was closest to home and we knew the process would be long
i knew that it definitely needed 2 new tires that shouldve been it
my car looks great
the story had a 2002 vw jetta with engine power issues and a check engine light
again i wasnt making a long trip in this vehicle
i was super shocked though to have the repairman explain to me what they had done even showing me the old filters and the various empty fluid containers they used
its been a few months ago that i went in to have my tires rotated front to back well the next day i started having some steering issues
i found busted knuckle through yelp
my car died
but who or what has warranty as good as costcos
mind you this whole time me and my dad and this asshole salesman wearing glasses were standing the whole time
smallest and most confusing best buy to navigate that ive ever been to
the staff there was professional and nice and willing to help
i have seen russo and steele consistently put on a great show
daryl just did my 06 avalanche 6 lift and rims and tires and more
it was detirmined that i also needed a clutch master cylinder which boosted price a bit more but it made perfect sense to me
looking forward to doing more business with him in the future
because everyone knows those nicks will tear into the gasket with the expansion of the head under heat
the terrain is mostly hard packed dirt and rocks
not a harley dealership but one that sells the hot ticket these days triumph ducati  bmw
he tells us that it was ready so in this case we were expecting at least a call if it was ready
i will be back to you guys soon
she even gave me priceless advice on how to easily remove or polish scratches and bug splatter from my car with cheap products which will save me a ton of money in expensive car washes too
very disappointed in this store
they will do much of unnecessary work and you will be charged hundreds bucks for nothing
we reserved either a suburbannavigator and there was none clearly on the lot
they mess with all of my seats dont fix the door mats then give me a dirty look when i dont tip them
great place to get all sorts of odds and ends to fix almost any and everything great service great stock great sales and a little bit of everything my go to place for all sorts of tools accessories and gadgets
i took him up on his offer and i offered to pay for the road service and aaron would not let me
the new unit only lasted a month
i was told it would take 34 hours and ending up taking almost double that
but they also did some stuff  that they didnt have to which was amazing
oh yeah and the price is right
i have recommended dc to a lot of friends and have never heard anything negative
i guess shame on me for purchasing the car even with all the red flags
within a few minutes everything was taken care of
honest hard working guys
i wouldnt recommend that contract to anyone wearing a us military uniform
he told sarah exactly what he wanted out of a silverado and she had already brought the specific trucks up for him to view
the point is they treat you like you are an honesttogod valued customer and thats one thing there is never enough of in our lives
this is where it all started
ill definitely take my car whatever i may be driving at the time back to miracle auto body
we made an appointment to bring it in
seems unsanitary and its a mess
very unprofessional and without a doubt rude
one word slow appointments are worthless
then the next week i had to bring the jeep in yet again because the differential they worked on starting making this crazy loud winding sound when you let off the gas
they were honest and cheaper and i value that more than anything
the place was spotless and organized
he has me in and out within 10 minutes and also helped me with all of my paper work
i really appreciated this even if they only cost a few bucks each
i am currently in contact with the bbb and corp since no one at the dealership has held mark or themselves to any accountability for his negligence and misinformation
steve jr did my cla250 twice already and im very happy with the workmanship
ive come home and cut open an onion to reveal mold
the person with whom i dealt was stefanie and she has no idea about what is meant by customer satisfaction or service
they lie about car mechanical issues
thank you guys
anywayill spend my money and time somewhere else
i asked what his name was he replied shawn or sean however he spells it i wouldnt buy anything you were selling just based off your arrogantshitty attitude
i called all day wednesday and left many message with no answer or return call
they are honest and never try to sell a part or service that you dont need
returned again and they found a hose routed improperly over the accelerator linkage
i finally decided to take the leap and upgrade to an iphone after some infuriating experiences with my blackberry
we also got some helpful information from a young man at the front desk didnt get his name
was incredibly responsive to any questions phone calls or texts
go to randy for your tinting needs and youll be happy you did
best automotive experience ive ever had
theyve taken my car without an appointment diagnosed my car for free and have fixed little odds and ends without charging me
even left a bottle of spray jax wax body shine that he sells for me to try
zac called the next day and said hed found one and that i could bring my vehicle back the following day here i sit in their parking lot writing this review
i found these guys while doing the usual search in my area
the waiting area has comfortable seats and many tvs to watch as well as a couple to watch your car go through the process
it is important to support local businesses
i will not be returning here for any car services or recommend this company after my experience with them
i have wheel locks for my jeep and they didnt have the unique tool needed to unlock my tires and they didnt mention the wheel locks
i said i doubt he would replace the steering wheel
this place suck
went outside waited another 5 minutes and finally the same person i began the day with shows up and takes me back inside to collect for the services rendered
of course i think this is weird being that to this point ive never had issues with my car
plus use the 20 coupons and they will accept emailonline coupons from your phone so you can keep using them until they expire
thanks jiffy lube
do yourself a favor and find a good independent mini mechanic like i did
very professional in following up on it with a phone call
they ended up charging 300 after i told them i didnt want all the nonsense they were trying to sell me on
gentleman was very nice
they certainly went above and beyond to accommodate me during the repair process
every experience with our salesman scott mcewan has been great
this was round and round on rough rocky terrain
i noticed after the last oilfilter change that the service dept didnt affix the sticker reminding me when the next oil change is due
we looked around at other models but the bf had is eye on the one we saw online
you blew me away
my service attendant was very friendly knowledgeable and respectful  which i really like normally i prefer to be called by my first name only but i felt that being called mr in this place was kinda nice
he did what the manufacturer required and also changed the transmission fluid at my request
they couldve very easily convinced me that the damage was from my most recent accident and charged me to fix it but they were upfront and honest which you dont find often anymore
no salesman or dealership should ever sell a car knowing the tires are all leaking air
i must say the corn is forever on my mineand the pork and brisket juicy and tender is to die for
its not scottsdale but its definitely not the ghetto either
i ended up going here with a coupon that i bought from yelp
ive been a customer for so many years now i dont even remember how long its been
instead i was quoted a rate of 2000 for exhaust repairs to pass inspection
that shouldnt be a big deal but as a visibly queer and genderqueer person its invaluable
this location is convenient but i would rather use a half tank of gas to go to the craig location
i just hope this review can save a couple headaches for a couple people
i definitely recommend seeing them
dont be fooled by the drab gritty exterior
they got me fixed up without hesitation quickly and affordably
we sat outside for close to an hour waiting after they took his car into the station
i called techna glass back i tried to call the store directly but thats impossible
unwilling to spend that amount of money and wanting a 2nd opinion i took my car to another local mechanic with great reviews on yelp message me for the name
two lessons learned in this
we explained we were paying cash and wanted to know the bottom line price aka out the door
i also like that they have free vacuums and they never have a very long wait
i said i would do it myself and i found them changed anyway and the 38 added in at the end of my bill after pick up
pep boys is the only store i could find online who had this product in store
i will recommend him to all my friends
i dislike parking garages
he went above and beyond to get rid of a pesky brake light that wouldnt turn off no charge as well as fix my steering wheel alignment as a courtesy
i drive one of the last off the line rsx type s acuras
id suggest calling about a week in advance
i took my second car here for an oil change even though i have only driven it 500 miles in 18 months
while waiting for the car one of the techs even got online and help3d me find a tool for a seperate project im working on
i was also promised many things upon purchase the sales guy mick came back with a blank sheet stating dont worry we will have all those things taken care of after the purchase and didnt need a documented copy
well she finally got me to service
nobody likes dealing with car repair issues especially when it involves accidents but the staff here was professional and went out of their way to make the entire process go as smoothly as possible
food has spot on flavor nice and hot
i would have rather broken down in the desert than stay at that place any longer
i just bought hp muffler and exhaust tips guess whos installing and welding them up
im not sure if they have the cheapest prices but i think honesty and morals goes a long way
sorry about that
when a dumb lady lol later backed into my car i did not hesitate to take the car right back to them
had it ever crossed his high school 10th grade equivalent mind that the sloppy kid at the counter could have reprinted my receipt and offed it to one of his friends
i hope everyone that reads this will think twice before using a car wash here since it seems that they are easily broken and it is not guaranteed to work apparently
when i asked if i should just come back in an hour the clerk told me that id still have to wait
clean gas stations
i even increased our down payment from 1k to 2k and still got a bunch of bs
you order at the register your food is weighed and fixed right in front of you and given to you on the spot in a large tray that more closely resembled a small crate
my daughters suv was a mess and full of dog hair so bad i could not imagine cleaning it
plus if youre lucky you might be able to watch as they transform a car with one of their super clean wrap jobs
mike the owner totally made up for it by reaching out apologizing and even offering to take off the fee to remove the tint that came with my new car
he is the reason i am driving my 02 pt cruiser at 190000 plus miles  and i look forward to many more
4 no cash accepted
price for us for 24 hrs was 170 plus tax
pauline and male came out to detail the truck
were compelled to go elsewhere
of course this is a car dealership and they want to make money so there were some standard sales tactics used
i get car back she tells me tech cannot adjust sensitivity its simply on or off i tell her what i read in the manual she then asks me to show her and insists that isnt right
doesnt get any better than this
on the we owe you slip we made sure to ask for the three rows seat covers the air conditioner needs to be checked
theyll educate you visually and verbally with what was going on and also warn you about botch jobs on your car in my case my oil filter
just now i checked in internet on how to replace the cabin airfilter
now does this seem right no
would have saved me a ton of money and would have been better done as well
they did take my car in and steve  said he wouldnt charge me to install the bulb
after we recollected emotionally and mentally we made a quick phone call to autonation nissan tempe to make an appointment to get it changed over there
thanks for making auto repair feel like i got an honest job and not over charged
the total lack of concern on what type of oil and lack of skill that they have at this business warrants not going there again
then this dude said if you pay 14 its unlimited for thee entire month
new belts valves oil and filters
long term customers right here
im seriously disappointed in the lack of beards here
how can anyone be so bad at running a car wash
to my great surprise they said you have at least a yearif not longer left if youre driving 15k miles per year
well i was surpised to see you can rate car dealerships but hey why not
nice stuff about the dealership they have a cafe with sandwiches  fooddrinks on the premises
and here is why
highly reccomend it to anyone
i do have to say that the crispy rice dish though was fantastic
we had a new chevrolet impala and we put over 1000 miles on it
i bought 4 sets of tires they put them on my car balanced them checked if all the breaks are good
anyway the brisket and bbq sauce were not unlike what i get in austin tx after lunch we took a look at the wines bears cute gift shop
im lost when it comes to after market truck items
this is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review
mistakes are made
i love this place
as a female i am always scared of taking a car in for anything mechanical
keep it up guys i hope you guys stay in downtown mesa for years to come
she was very upset and said it will never be new again
im not sure why i even bothered to take my car back here a second time after my initially  experience
my girlfriend had their chicken wings and fries which were also surprisingly goood
great job guys and keep up the great customer service
tim lange and gary kravetz helped make our buying experience fast  easy along with a good deal
kayla the great young lady helped me understand the upkeep on the bike from showing me how to check the oil making sure its at the right level how to check the tire pressure she was very knowledgeable
restrooms are also clean
alan the owner is a great guy to talk to
hey it is a convenience store
love the work they did
they werent letting me talk to them
i took it into the guys at cars for a once over
however the service department is absolutely horrible
the jeep already comes with a built in alarm from the factory and when they install the alarm they cut the wire harness which voids your warranty right there unless you take it back to them for warranty work
highly recommend flash for your next wash
service is quick although you have to wait for a table
i paid 300 for nothing but an oil change
it seems like you should let people go when they dont want to talk to you after the first 5 weeks or so
thanks to her my car no longer smells like mildew and cigarettes
you wont find him amidst the oneupping dealers on camelback trying to outdo each other with blowup signs and false advertising
thank you for nothing
very competitive great sales people etc
unfortunately theyre always closing and opening my electric mirrors which eventually strips the housing unit
but i was the one who had called the dealership and it was not him soliciting me for the car
my car may be inching to the older side now as a 2004 with higher mileage near 142k but i would not classify it to be a pos a beater or on its last leg
theron was the first to approach us and asked if he could help us
i wont write this out in too much detail but essentially i got a used truck here and found out that there was two vin numbers one on door and one on dash
strange so i decided to check inside my sunglasses case just to make sure and to my surprise gone
he recognized me since i was actually there a few days before the latest incident for routine oil change tire rotation and at the time the third recall
she argued and he took another person and he was attending the other customers like they were stupid
i returned to this dealership after getting my first honda from andy
to this day its still not quite clear just whats covered and whats not covered
they will treat you right and buy from bryant k
i also wanted to buy a luggage rack
i was told it was a guy at future service named brian
started off great
they put zero pressure on me and worked to get the best price for exactly what i was looking for
kg auto service was recommended to us by our new neighbor when we moved to the area and we couldnt be happier
i would absolutely recommend service king the next time some idiot rear ends you while at a complete stop at a red light
i recommend this place to anyone who wants quality service at a affordable price
you dont even need soy sauce
the rep was so helpful
i only had their ribs beans and potato salad  but i am not sure if i would go back to sample their other stuff
they didnt vacuum the weather stripping
i did the initial contact while overseas and glad i did
apparently it included new everything including calipers and rotors and the pads and other parts  but my cars calipers were fine and didnt need to be replaced and the rotors werent in great shape but could be saved for at least a couple more months by being machined
fair timely sensitive to your families budget
gary shaw was our sales advisor
avoid this place
as such its not as cheap as arco but still a pretty decent value when you need to fill up
i first metspoke to ed in sales on line
so by the time i get home its after six
and he was very fair on the price
their minimum was 49 but the guy only charged me 39 since it went so quickly
i think they took about 20 mins or less to get there
ive used them a few times  like the promptness  the way the drivers help with bags
i couldnt see any evidence they had vacuumed and the dash wasnt even wiped down
they did do a very good job on the body of the car
we waited for the offer sheet and much to our surprise lowballed us quite a bit more than 2000 below the lowest kbb tradein value
their current favorites are the philly cheese steak the burgers and of course the pizza
the man who first took care of my order tim was wonderful
i brought this to the attention of the service department but they said no that didnt matter
for the last four years this has been the gas station we have used for gas soda chips candy etc
the salads were excellent as were the sausages and stuffed potatoes
look no further when needing car repairs
she and andrea provide quick quality service at fantastic prices
once again joe did an outstanding job and recommended a compustar smartphone controlled unit
i understand this because i teach it ive been a customer service trainer for decades
all is good with this and it should be like this
the meal ended up costing us almost 100 but it was worth it for a once a year celebration
paid for the ultimate package and when they gave me my truck back back it looked like i had paid for the basic package
i spent about 5 minutes touching up those spots with a microfiber cloth and that took care of it
he has worked on my silverado and my malibu maxx
there were no managers they just were fired wonder why
i have a 2001 crown victoria that runs on natural gas
he treated me very well  asked me how i liked my car blah blah blah you know made small talk i sat and wrote some code in their waiting room  it was super quiet in their which is great for me
seriously i showed up without an appointment and left about 90 mins later with my new car
not only that but he beat everybodys quote and saved me a lot of
a good and honest mechanic is hard to find in this city
i was charged 15000 for a mess
on the first vehicle they failed to complete an oil change
this is the only reason i gave the place as many stars as i did
very friendly place
called since 1130 its now 210 pm at 110 degrees and still waiting on the towingwtf really at this type of service i should have just call my insurance roadside allstate they would have been faster and much better i give them 0 rating with a suggestionbe honest when giving us a time frame of how long 777 towing will be at locationextremely dissatisfied and disappointed  next time its quality towing for sure
this stuff didnt even come close
none of the services fletchers said i neededwas in the report from my dealer though the the dealer also reported issue with the suspension system just a different cause
they dont care about their customers testing for defective parts doing a good job or behaving like professionals
brought my frontier in because my tire sensor indicator was going off and two of my sensors were under warranty due to recent repairs at a different nissan dealership
i hate it when kids say that and i applaud companies that rework their technology to deliver quality service
and when theyre done they pull your car around hold the door for you to get in and wish you well on your way
they through the spare in my trunk with out putting it back in right
leather like new was recommended and both pieces now look good as newi kid you not
he very clearly explained the work performed even so much as to grab the rotor hed replaced and show me the measurements against what was in his service manual
only in mesa for work on thursdays id previously stopped in to ask a couple questions and get advice which was amicably provided and useful
i totally trust chill and his employees
sure enough they said bring it up and we will take care if it
these guys recently moved from the obscure walton street entrance to right on gerrard  walton was always annoying because it was a oneway street
i took in my 2006 e350 mercedes benz    they told me it would be 320000 i went to another repair shop and they quoted me 2200
i will never purchase another vehicle elsewhere
i live in columbus ohio and will make it a point to get an oil change here when im in town visiting family because i trust them
we love our honda cars but i wouldnt buy another car from them if my life depended on it
this subsequently caused a catastrophic failure
very good price here on this car wash  my friends and i drove out of the way to find this one
dont waste your money on their more than half a wash
i would think that any mechanic in madison should know this
i originally went there to purchase a phone and had no intentions of trading my old phone in
i have to drive to walters take the bus back home and catch it back  to get my car
i am new to the neighborhood and have a 14 year old 34 ton suv
my friend was installing it for me
red curry chicken delicious and spicy
the only con i suppose is that the english barrier
maybe this crew needs a training program and some manners
five days later the car had jerky rough shifting
to be fair i would break it down as follows  4 stars the initial process of buying and financing the car  1 star the registrationplates process and lack of communication  5 stars how mr cole and leah handled it once they got involved would i buy from them again
they have a wide variety of tires available and can order anything they dont have
this was by far the worst car washvacumn service i have ever had in my life
so i wait in the waiting room for an hour and a half and they finally take my car around the block for a minute or two
food or service
but the random 3rd party salespeople trying to catch my attention with small talk is super annoying
i was in and out in about 25 minutes will definitely use them again for similar stuff
remember you pay for what you get
since it was a sunday and i had to get back to new jersey i had no choice to bring my car to pepboys for a diagnostic which wound up revealing spark plugs and an ignition coil
i live literally 5 min away but ill drive to cambridge or collingwood for service or the mechanic near work
my speakers were making a cranky noise so i stopped in the store and the salesman by name of chris got into my car to check out the sound on all of them
instead theyve lost a customer for life
i reminded mike about the appointment i made and he looked dumbfounded
this tall  bald employee said im very busy right now then he pointed out the pale of water and towels and made me wipe off the car myself
i saw the quote bottom right corner says total roughly 140
my chevys  have been serviced at jimmy johnsons and city chevrolet of san diego ca
everyone was super nice and kept asking if i needed anything
i felt like we were given the old bait and switch routine
my letter stated not to take the car in a solution was in the works and to wait until i receive a 2nd letter in order to take it in
ultimately contacted me saying that the vehicle needed an oil change and a highpressure fuel pump cost would be 1300
victor was professional honest and fair
staff very nice and quick
but we made one last call to this place
wish i had a costco with a car wash near where i live
love their all beef hot dogs and its so easy to sneak in there to eat with no membership
which he answered them all
hybrid words are cool too
you wont catch me doing any service here
part sports car part luxury sedan  all beast
pays attention to detail and does good clean work
not even dressed professionally
love these guys
they converse and get to know you
additionally i had brake work and an alignment done
so i loaded it up in my truck the night before drove it there and dropped it off
he even had a smile when the rest of us who live here are complaining about the heat
they suck at working on japanese cars as well they failed miserably at making some basic repairs on an old 93 honda accord i had several years back and after going back to them four times they still couldnt get it right
they found that abc nissan never did an alignment
airpark had one
we didnt bite and it was a fight to get the finance manager to move on from it
i have lived in anthem now for almost 6 years and have been coming to brake masters for most of my vehicles services
overall i recommend this place 100
the right balance of noodles peanuts and sauce
i would recommend
just wanted to shout out to darrell sexton service department for his help a couple of weeks ago
i brought my 2010 subaru forester in 925 for a car wash and detailed have the carpets and seats shampooed and cleaned
was i wearing the wrong clothing
2000 miles later no engine light and car rides smooth
avoid the silverado  serene store
lotus of siam is the best thai food ive had to date in the us
i opted just to keep taking lyft and the bus and losing hours of my time every day because at least i know whats up that way and i dont get stuck paying even more for this debacle
lets just say other salesman at other dealers did not want to bother with it all they want you to do is for you to drive the truck and negotiate
my boyfriend also brings his truck in for regular maintenance
it might be ever so slightly difficult to find them
if this was his site alone i could raise my review substantially
thank you guys so much
thank you sanderson lincoln for your wonderful service and for doing an impeccable job
will definitely return to these guys for any future installs on my stang
i have since returned to order bumpers spare tire carrier and rocker guards
unfortunately once the vehicle returned to the shop for closer inspectionrepair i got a call telling me that my issue was the result of other part failures and not related to the damaged part that i suspected was the root issue
as soon as i said the address they were like lotus of siam
i go back 2 days later for and when i get there they said the couldnt tell me whats wrong with the system but charged me 150
i know this was a minor issue but based on this experience i would never hesitate to return or recommend franks
for a side fact i came in knowing my check engine light was on faulty temp sensor itll just keep doing it and i just get it shut off every so often and also to make sure its nothing else as well they didnt mention a word about it
he was able to remove it for me and not my mini cooper is all good
sam is super nice knows his stuff cold and is cheap to boot
or not returning calls but even a little bit of bad service hurts a company along the way
they had located the car prior to my arrival
starting with misrepresentation of their inventory  advertised as new and even confirmed after a direct conversation car had over 5k to matching a competitive trade appraisal 2500 less
he offers competitive pricing with an unmatched attention to detail
what was it all for wesley
prices seem reasonable too
this was seriously the conversation we had over a mistake
if you want to see maggots go to the zoonot joe firment
i came here for various reasons my car had a lot of issues the headlights the radio and the shifter boot
i was originally hesitant to go here because of all the negative reviews but my husband insisted since they had a honda pilot that seemed to be exactly what we were looking for  we had an great experience with our buy
i went around with them for 2 days struggling to get a call back
thanks for all that you have done
only took them about 15 minutes to get to me even though they quoted 40 and the guy was very nice and got the door opened in seconds
as soon as i pointed this out the manager agreed that it should have been replaced and i had an appointment to bring the car back in
customer service was so bad i had to have someone else pick up the car
not how id run my business but what do i know im just the one paying them
thats what i appreciated the most
david was a fabulous guide
thought i had a throttle position sensor problem so i took it to him to have it looked at
not a business ill be patronizing in the future
he even checked my spare i had to ask thoughwere heading out of town and i wanted to make sure the spare was not flat
not a ride for comfort but make sure you are strapped in and have a pad under your hind parts
brought my tacoma in for service the check engine light was on and trac off light was on as well
are you kidding me
i confused for a moment
still waiting for a call back
chris you cant go anywhere
i was in here a few months ago getting tires for a different car
but i will not return i appreciate them fixing the leak but to not stand behind your work and return someones money when you know it was your negligence that caused it is a gross misconduct in my opinion
while these 2 issues may not be a big deal to some they are to me and i will take the 25 gift card and give it away as this was the straw that broke the camels backthey will never get another dime from me again
i just went back there today
i hate this car and the fact that youve guys already been paid by the finance company upsets me because im stuck with it
i open up the wrap and it was literally 2 pieces of chicken and nothing else
living in las vegas it gets pretty hot once in a while especially during the summer
he showed me where there was complimentary coffee and how to access the free wifi
heads up that this is one of those gas stations where the price on the marquee is not the price you pay if you are using credit  debit  about 006gallon difference with card
re 2  it is true that the shop didnt fix anything that i didnt want fixed but the shop did tell me that both the battery and the muffler needed replacing immediately without any explanation
i will not miss waiting almost 6 hours for an oil change and the rude brush off i got when the problem was clearly something they were responsible for
oh they dont make those brake pads for your car
give joe a call if you need any kind of mobility device to get around
if you like him to fix your problems i think twice of to date oct 2016 has not been fix
sit down relax grab a white castle from the freezer with a soda and have lunch then for dessert go to the yogurt bar at least thats what i did
the papaya salad taste like something a foreigner made
these arent the droids youre looking for
even my insurance adjuster told me that this body shop does great work
turns out the spark plugs in the car were in the car twice as long as recommended
he really took his time with us
ive never been so insulted or mad while trying to purchase something
i asked him for an owner and he refused to give me any information all he gave me was the phone number to the car wash i would suggest not using this place considering they have terrible customer service and will not honor the things that their machines break
when i told him that was not acceptable that he did not tell me he stormed off
since i was in a pinch i decided to pay to have the oil and filter changed before the trip and that should fix it
they used to be much better service is deteriorating quickly
who ever is responsible for sending my check back needs to do it
i told him this is the final amount i have and has to be after taxes and any fees
he insured that i had a thorough understanding of the car i was purchasing and the whole buying process
in the end it cost me 300 plus they took the car
its locallyowned too if you need another reason
the woman who helped us was nice and quick
he changed the spark plugs  giving new life to my volvo
i asked if victorys stored error codes and was told that wherever i heard that they did not was 100 wrong
25 for 4 pieces of midsized prawns
he recommended hans
so happy to have found this place my credit is garbage after the divorce and they were able to get my financed
wow just wow
i came for a full tank of premium and a works car wash  when i asked the attendant if the car wash was working he replied with a snotty of course and slapped the closed placard in front of the nonop register i was standing in front of
the best decision i made was to work with rich mason at north scottsdale bmw
this order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies
20 minutes for the test drivefilled out the application to be approved with an amazing rate 15 minutes after that
time passed i came back once again in december for my next service
after looking all day we ended up here and it could not have been a better experience
forget the other places this place is great if i didnt know better id say they invented customer service
thank you jason
you wont be disappointed
i have been recommending this dealership to everyone for the last 5 years i have had two friends buy cars from here and my husband and i were getting ready to buy his next car from them
great job as always
he also checked out wear on the chain and other components to make sure my bike was in proper working order
i will never go back
the first time i have ever had my car professionally detailed
would they pay for damages
called tuesday at 100 as i was leaving and i was informed that i should wait 30 min
yet the employee still staid it would be here in 2 days
1610 but he kept it an even 16
well it was too late the man had taken a flat head screw driver shoved it into the tread and removed the rubber to show me the wires underneath
oh and on top of everything  they actually cleaned my car  they nailed the big things and the little things
thanks again guys
after my muscle car was detailed people literally waved and honked their horn while cruising in my clean machine
been going there for the past 2 years excellent service by a dynamic team at competitive price
i applied online and was followed up by a phone call from ms kelly
i bought the key fob and did it my self in less than 30 seconds
i guess just brakes is just too much for this place to handle
i was so excited
they broke it
they went above and beyond
im a first time car owner and overly attached to my vehicle lol love is weird what can i say
so i have to wonder if they just show for the first cleaning and the big  then dont bother to follow up
stir fried chicken with basil was really excellent
but i am not the pickiest person either
the shop wasnt very busy when i pulled up and one of the guys walked up to greet me at my vehicle
there is a lot of parking so its just a matter of how close youll be to the store
hendricks is a disgrace to the mercedes name but south charlotte treated me with the respect one would expect to be treated with when spending that type of money on a vehicle
if midas doesnt want to honor a groupon purchased by a customer they shouldnt fabricate work that needs to be done on your car
this place is a shit show the do shit work for a super expensive bill
i started coming here about a year ago
special thanks to the gm and his crew for such outstanding work
that didnt help our situation which he was still apathetic about as he hung up the phone without even trying to make the deal work
im lucky to have found them
and did it completely blow my mind
the new owners seem to really want to take care of their customers and keep them coming back which i will
i was at firestone and to get a battery and they told me i needed to get 2 new back tires because the tred was low
or healthy for that matter
his positive attitude and friendliness made this car buying experience the most pleasant one ive had
i can only describe this place as the dsneyworld of gas stations plently of pumps drinks galore fro ice coffees slushies frozen drinks freezer goods too much to list
trust me dude if i knew how to change the battery on my car i wouldve done it myself and avoided dealing with you jerks at all costs but thats not the case
its not like i drive a brand new camaro with thousanddollar rims but thats beside the point they shouldnt be causing damage while fixing unrelated damage
crispy duck with drunken noodles wasnt a favorite
when i made the appointment they told me it would take a couple of hours
god bless and thank you
i checked the cars maintenance indicator and it showed that i needed just an oilandfilter change
first off would like to thank my fellow yelpers for directing me here
by then i had to call out at work and we found out there was a new issue with our voltage regulator
my husband and i came in 31217 just browsing for a new truck husband has always wanted a hummer and mentioned that to the sales rep loren
ive been here several times before for some work but it seems maybe their management has changed since then and they dont mind ripping off repeat customers
i felt i had to call to check on the status of my car vs them being proactive and doing it themselves
luckily though management was able to pass the buck to other staff members for vehicle delivery  not have the courage to stand behind the poor repairs their shop passes off
that is a nice gesture for a bored customer who maybe wanted to head over towards the mall
super happy with this place
i highly recommend this place
he gave me the prices he had on file and said he would get updated prices and give me a call back
theyve always set me up for a very nice loaner for my repairs and followed up with me with phone calls during and after service
worst customer service ive ever had with any company in my life
my one complaint is that my husband and i had to wait a long time when we came to sign papers and pick up the car
the employees attitude was beyond rude and the way we were treated was ridiculous
i went to sun auto and in three days they had the buckle and is charging me 238 to replace the belt and buckle
ive used green cab numerous times since they opened for operation and the service is extremely inconsistent
i am highly disappointed and cannot imagine how a person who cares about his job or keeping his job completely ignores the customer
i also have a small exhaust leak forming after the first day of driving
basically i wanted to be sure that i qualified for what i wanted before i drug my family across the valley
shes not your typical car salesperson and thats such a refreshing change
i wonder what he thought looked dirty
although this location wasnt ideally convenient in terms of distance from my home i decided to try them
she respectfully declined the work
he already knew the issues i was in for and had a loaner vehicle ready for me so i could get to work
stay far far away
called leftys and they advised us to bring it back we did and they disconnected the alarm and that was it
great service and friendly folks
1 star for no integrity
later  he told me he had called the previous owner about the key and was waiting for a call back
in addition they helped me calculate the costs of my next move
about 30 minutes after setting the appointment at my home address i was called into the office due to a shortage of staff
tom did an excellent job getting all my tvs to work again
he is in contact with me the whole time
when he finished with the other car i approached him to ask what i needed to know and said may i ask a question
kurt is the best and this dealership is damn worth the trip from san francisco
these guys can make a miracle out of misery
they were a bit too dry to me
well i arrived at 745 am and not another customer to be found
they have an awesome no appointment necessary express side for oil changes tire rotations etc
and while juggling the cordless phone talking to aps answering all my questions
during the purchase of our vehicle chris legere  did not notify us that the truck only had one key
i recommend that you come here
90 in unauthorized  repairs that they made me pay for prior to releasing my vehicle quickly reversed when i threatened  to report them to mastercard  and demanded a copy of the dropoff slip
hard to come by reps like that
updated and some nice finishes
around 6pm i arrived at findlay north volkswagen and was greeted by daniel
i also think their sales team and parts department are excellent
in the meanwhile i now have a truck i can barely use for three months and its a theft risk and my dogs cant ride it in because theyll put their faces through the plastic
on the groupon ad it states regular price is 240 and is reduced to 99
had i known before i could have had my roommates window done too an still saved money
i would highly recommend these guys
easy as always
the only auto shop in lv where you dont feel taken for a ride
this is by far the best enterprise experience i have ever had
in my mind had the first associate not been quite so short this discount tire would have gotten a 5 star review
i wont be going anywhere else
kept working through the heat of day and made my car look like new
horrible horrible horrible company
i was still out in 10 min with a basic wash and interior clean
prima might have tried the same upsell shenanigans and overcharge me like every other dealership but at least they refer to me by my proper name and title provide free wifi and starbucks in the waiting room and wash the exterior of my car for free
look for coupon from unlv youll save the tip money
an hour later my brother him and left a message but he didnt call back
consistently impressed with the way bmw chapman handles their costumers
we got the medium spicy level which was a bit too spicy for my husband he usually eats average spicy but i loved it i can take red hot spicy and i actually wished it was a bit more spicier for me
being that i found this about a week after they repaired my tire it didnt make sense to me to try and convince them who was at fault
place is a scam
transparency in car sales is not always at such a high level
im the first to admit that i dont believe i ordered the right things on my previous visits so i take ownership of that
the guy at the counter checked my tires and said that they were wearing pretty evenly  when the tread gets to a 5 the tire should be replacedand i guess my tires are at an 8
when they stopped 3 lug nuts on one of the rear wheels could be hand loosened
instead of focusing on what my needs and wants were he was more concerned about just getting the sale
then she said these passes are for family members only
comeon 79 dollars later and you cant even top off the most basic of fluidsi guess that follows all the other comments in regards to service
and my son is still asleep as im writing this outside the birthday party
everyone in the store was very friendly and chatty
his mobile service is completely selfcontained  he didnt require anything from me
far from jiffy
also never keep any communication
all 5 employees arguing with me that it hasnt been 40 minutes and my jeep wasnt touched before the manager point out its timestamped to refund my money
but even i asked people working at the terminal didnt know
for an oil change
it turned out whoever balanced my tires used the incorrect wheel cap and made the tires in juans words completely out of whack
what i am complaining about is the lack of troubleshooting ability on the techs part
needless to say i dont trust many people to work on my car as ive been screwed by other dealers in the past
i walked into carmax and met jason
i completely agreed
the folks who work there stopped me as i walked in and asked for the make and model of my car
come get your car washed for free on your birthday
he and his team made sure that the various stages of the sale purchase and delivery went smoothly and that all my questions were answered thoroughly
everyone was friendly
my experience there compared to other car companies was less than par
still a slight markup but pretty much right down the middle with reasonable labor costs
24 hour tire shop what
5 stars fir these guys
the people who work behind the counter see me standing there but continue their slow pace
love a g repair they have great customer service and they did wonderful job on my 2010 toyota corolla transmission and oil change
i would definitely send my friends and family to pep boys on lake mead to see him
people make mistakes were only human
i went for an oil change the other day and dealt with a guy named chris he was gross they dont practice hygiene
i usually like to get 2nd or 3rd opinions before i do anything to my car come to find out i didnt need any of the things replaced
i was very pleased with this auto shop and will go again if my car incurs trouble
they didnt move the seats forward or back to vacuum underneath so there was a lot missed
i rented a truck for 1995 plus mileage well they dont tell you this well your purchaseing this nor do they tell you there holding 80 dollars because its 59 a mile yes there holding it and will refund what you dont use of this sounds like something your intrested in well this is your place i hope this review helps
appreciated honesty of may or may not want to do this because of vs high pressure sales or fear based selling techniques
my husband and i was so thankful that there is still some people like that
first id like to say that i have been a customer with freeway chevrolet for about 3 years now and in that time i have purchased 3 vehicles one outright with no tradein
i had to turn my leased car before i got a company car and left my credit card in there
the coffee sucked though
what are supposed to do with a red one
guy showed up on time and got the job done in about an hour
i applied to see if i qualified for a loan through them and i got approved for a loan
i visit this station weekly to get a car wash they have free car vacuums
for the price im paying they did a great job
in the meantime i was paying for a rental car
i was greeted by lamont when i first got to the car wash he asked me how i was before anything else and then proceeded to help me with my groupon
hes the best one and ive dealt with at least 4 others there
when we did get service tim provided great service
i must say that this one is always clean the fresh coffee smells great and the food on the grill is always fresh and full
after they completed the services they vacuumed out my car
eat drink and be merry my friends
i will find another hand wash business that actually cares about their customers and not just their bottom line
these guys are fast and efficient and know what they are doing
and it will take a few days to get the kit
these guys dont pressure you at all to buy and if you have questions they have legitimate answers for you
i bought a vw eos hard top convertible from them that would have cost a lot more at a different dealer
unfortunately i was introduced to up to three additional people trying to make the sale
he was no pressure and followed up with me regularly over the past few month
unfortunately this place gave me my car back in worse condition than it was before the accident
good job and love the free vacuum service at the end
sun auto rocks
i should have turned and ran when i first saw it but they had good reviews
i normally just do it by myself when i get home
you would never know there was a problem
at least when i was living in california we had better weather to work on a car outside i knew one friend who knew how to fix cars or i had an honest and experienced mechanic nearby that knew what was wrong based on descriptions given without having to charge for any diagnostic fees every single time
ive been going here since moving to pittsburgh four years ago
just bought a 2015 ford mustang gt premium
marcel was awesome to deal with as well
his shop is all business and not as polished as others but rob will take good care of you
it seemed like an honest review but not yelp elite caliber
that marbling  lol  but
the driver had good communication asked all of the right questions and made sure he knew exactly what was needed
every person in every department was amazing but i worked the most with lisa and jeremy and they were phenomenal
i told the front desk person i been waiting for 25 hours and my car hasnt moved
so i went in to bl and found them to be very professional and knowlegeable
i am probably not the target market for a motorcycle place  this or any other  but it so happened that we stopped by for a festival that they were having hung out for the day and it was mostly because of the staff
check their prices online as they may be lower and they will honor them in store
this place is all about value  9 for a hand wash and dry
they wanted to know my creditincome history prior to negotiating
he has zero customer service skills
the service rep told me my car was ready and took me to the cashier who charged me over 100 for the wiper blades 2 front  one rear
i did not feel as if i was being taken advantage of
i always leave reviews good or bad if someone or some company does a job for me
farri took the time to understand exactly what i was looking for rather than steering me towards buying something i couldnt afford at the moment
theres a small shop where employees are available to assist you with items you can find at a gas station
on the day that my car was promised to be ready i went to pick it up
i would have loved to give this place a 5 star based solely on the food but the phone and seating experience was not the best
he suggested a wonderful synthetic oil that gives me 8 more mpg and protects my engine better than the fossil oil
seriously not anyone in charge here
maybe he did not make a big commission off me
take your business elsewhere even the people on craigslist is probably more honest
but their price was 71
he explained and gave me a quote based on both sides of my vehicle and how if i wanted to budget he could rub out the one ding pretty well without charging me
because it was so simple they didnt charge us for the 58 diagnosis fee because they just had to look under the hood and found the problem
ive brought several cars to him over the years and hes always serviced them well at a fair price
that night i was driving my car on the highway and the noise was just unbearable that was coming from the wheels
i paid somewhere in the mid 70s and was pretty surprised
life is good
last winter for no reason the tuck wouldnt start needed a battery boost
norma and shannon were wonderful to deal with
they got me an estimate within 30 minutes and initially i wasnt too happy with it
if you are in the market for a car this is the dealership to go to
after purchasing them he was outside putting them on our vehicle when an autozone worker came outside to help
now that he lives two states away i dont have that luxury anymore
rebate check right there n the spot
my honda element looks as good as it did when i bought it new
every person in there greets you professionally and handles you with care
my brother has an appointment and were confident they will fix it
you know what i will never ever set foot into this shop again
i received five thats right five upsells
if i pay for a service i expect just that
hard to troubleshoot over facetime
it is always clean and again always smells good
well no surprise but of course it wasnt making the noise when i pulled in
he offers to help me get it fixedawesomeno hell no
my oil change took way less than an hour and i plan to come back
although i didnt require additional work to be completed on my car they did spend considerable time to provide me with a report and information that i required to go to the warranty company
i would never go anywhere else for car service
thank you to danielle and everyone at alamo hand car wash for a truly superb experience
back in january we wanted to trade in our mustang a few months early from our lease end date and they were willing to work with us
will follow up if anything changes
going to gary harper and 3 on your side my payments were need late
they raised the price since the last time
i had been talking to ron one of the sales associates about purchasing a 2015 sonata with a popular equipment package
to cap it all off they do offer a warranty plus will fix 1 or 2 chips for free in future if you are unlucky enough to get any
purchased my fifth g class in the past 12 years from fj on sahara last year to try to give the vegas dealers some loyalty
ok so i have taken a few more cars and trucks to them since my last review
the service manager knows nothing about cars
i love costco incredible friendly service and amazing return policy
what i dont understand is why wasnt scotts original quote already in the system in my file
i will never prepurchase anything here again and i will never be coming back here for service needs
ive been to places in northern phoenix i came here for convenience where they changed and fixed the light bulbs for free
sean and chas did such a great job i wish i could give them six stars
thank you guys
i wouldnt be able to purchase a silverado and ran through gm financial
thank you noel and centennial
they had my bike the entire summer
gm said drive over to get the free washesper corp promise
i would personally recommend wolfs auto to anyone with an audi or vw
our sales person was very patient during negotiations and they were willing to work out a deal that fits our wants and needs
the employees were super friendly courteous and professional
they did  a terrible job
the food was of average quality and selection even for las vegas
the customer service was great and the work was professional
worst worst  beyond worst experience ever from all dealerships of all brands i had ever been to
the transmission went out the day before i was to drive it to california pulling a trailer on vacation
if you would like to try out a new model of harley rent one here youll be glad you did
kris and his shop are truly a godsend
we needed to get a door handle repaired on our 2006 hyundai elantra and get the drivers light panel to illuminate
he is knowledgeable honest and had our best interests at heart
let me assure you bulldog locksmith exceeded my expectations and then some
thank you randy jacobs for the outstanding service
after standing there looking silly to figure out how to open the gas tank the attendant came out to help
no complaints here as we just gas up here and havent had an issue to address
so it sat there unpaid unchallenged and accumulating fees
i call up the shop to verify and see if i need an appointment and they say just come on in
as a former employee for a car dealership i understood and knew everything he was saying but what happened next was out of this world
long story short i was almost scammed for nearly a thousand bucks and here to tell everyone within reach to avoid these clowns and take your business west
he even screwed it on for me i will always go here for all my propeller needs forever
there is always something wrong even if there isnt anything wrong
needless to say i will not go back to wilhelm for anything
next day engine light back on they dont want to answer our calls and are very good at evading
we took the car to a professional dealership and we were stunned when we learned that the frame had some serious damage which resulted from a previous accident
very happy with ease of process
pricing fair and competitive
the sales staff and the finance lady were great
kann ich somit guten gewissens weiterempfehlen
price is perfect you definitely get what you pay for and more here
chuck really helped us get the car we wanted
he was friendly and chatted with us a bit
the following day the mechanic actually called to see if i wanted to get started not the manager not an owner or administrative representative the mechanic
it honestly looked like it had not been cleaned in months
my car flunked smog in az but passes in ca
the front two brakes were all that needed fixin and they took care of it in about 2 hours for a reasonable price
quality bumper repair
i am always skeptical of garages and the mechanics in them
thy have an overnight drop off which made the whole thing much easier
big upsell operation  called service manager 5 times without 1 return phone call  placed complaint with ford motor co  still not a return call  i see a bunch of incentivized or fake reviews
heck i guess we needed to be charging to run our car hotel
we purchased a used vehicle a few months back
even tho it was 8am and there was a chance of rain the gentleman was happy to help after i explained my situation
additionally they broke a lug nut and left it on the tire talk about a safety issue
i paid the deposit and came back two days later to get the tires installed
i didnt have any serious problems with my charger until i started letting these guys fix on it
just make sure the dont scratch your car
they have a great selection and dont pressure you at all
we took it to our local mechanic who btw has the most respected reputation in oro valley  if not in the state
real people pleaser
they replaced the tire for free
attendant was super friendly and informative
jilmar jumped over several hurdles that i put up to make sure the deal got done
who does that
i would go back there in a heartbeat
i set an appt with her the next day though she sounded very reluctant to do so
my situation purchased a brand new windshield replacement last thursday
got a call from them in the afternoon telling me how i needed tons of additional work new tires etc
we had to deal with nathan who was extremely rude through the whole process
its material and labor
i thought that obriens was doing everything they could to make jared and i happy customers
firestone took several days to do anything about the gas tank being filled with diesel
now it was going to be wednesday 7115 because it needed an aligment
my wife was getting the iphone 5 upgraded from 16 to 32 gb and the price had gone up since she got hers
i suggest that you own it and embrace it
my lady friend had to go
those sneaky liers
the last time we will come here
i was supposed to get the signature treatment which includes a vacuum rainx treatment and a tire rotation with regular oil
im reminded why i should just stay at speedway  ie
no up selling you only get what you need
i bought my first two in virginia and tennessee
my husband agreed to increase our budget by 500 since he really liked the car
i will continue coming to this cobblestone because of the people who work here
if i could give them 100 stars i would
after he told me the car was ready and i drove 35 mins to get there i got in didnt even put my car into gear and  the ac was still blowing hot from one side oops
no pressure a good deal
the shelves were void of anything but snacks and boat parts so i thought id get some side dishes from the grill
i like to know whats going on
they said they couldnt fix it because it was fine and send us on our way again
do not waste your money on them
i let them know from the beginning that i was going to go thru my credit union
1 matt i think now works in the pacific kitchen center but was sent over to help me choose an auto audio system
have to go out of my way but so far the trips out here have been worth it on my end
then george showed me a line that goes through the tires in the center saying i must be running over things
its worth the wait
the tires had at least 50 of the tread left on them
i am very protective over my bike to let someone load it up and tow it away without me seeing how they did says a lot  stus motorcycle towing is the best in vegas i have used them more than once and i will use them again i am sure of that
this did leave a tiny bitter taste but i still utilize them
we will be returning
what they didnt know is that i speak spanish and understood everything
his staff is always so friendly when im there
the location is perfect for those in the downtown core too
he told me he could rebuild the transmition again for a fair price anyways compared to most transmission shops
i have had neither
joey was saying how they can not do anything about the rims because they were not painted by a professional how does joey know where i got my rims painted at
seriously this went on for about a half hour where he was almost begging me to initial his paper
people were very friendly but the wait was too much
i would highly recommend this place if you want to great quality work in a timely manner
ils veulent notre bien et le prenne jai eu un service atroce  chacune des fois ou jai du les utiliser et quand jai demand des prix pour des pneus ils sont toujours les moins bons alors on ny reviens que quand on est mal pris
when i refused 5 min later after taking a run around the floor they say ok we can do 11
i have had two vehicles repaired at this facility and was very satisfied with the results
they is a wine case thats clear and is seen when you walk through
i have taken my cars here for years and recommend chuck and his staff highly
if i could live here i would
note to self check tire pressure frequently
last year i took my car in and had some cash in the car which i throw change bills coins
i can not thank them enough for their complete care and honesty
save yourself from dealing with these morons and getting ripped off
a month later i let them know i was back in town we booked a time
instead of ordering a brand new expensive door handle and an arm rest for my old cede they suggested using ebay and it saved me a bundle
says he will find out and call me in 15 min dan calls  tells me i was approved but doesnt know the terms of the deal
i responded with how he expected me to fit and he persisted to yell and motion me to pull through
quality of service is still the responsibility of the management
no penalties no extra charges
will add that after a threat to report to bbb a manager named steven rescheduled my service for tuesday and offered to drop the cost it was already free though
due to the minimal leak they suggested an undercarriage wash and put in a fluorescent dye to help locate the source
the staff was welcoming jessica who works the reception was nice and provided great customer service
i would definitely recommend
went in a couple weeks ago for a quick wash and got the most expensive regular wash 25ish i think
not to mention im in the service industry and have been for the last 10 years out of college
they are absolutely the best
they had a quote in minuets and all the details explained in the whole process under 5 mins
my brother had his truck broken into a couple months ago and needed his window fixed asap he called this place and within the hour they were there and repaired his window
this included the oil and oil filter
tire empire was quick professional very friendly and i got a great deal
best in the biz
best bigo ive ever been to
a tire tech is the lowest paid tech in shop
staff out in the front smoking
we got an estimate while there to rewire our boat and decided to schedule that to get done in 2 weeks
the mechanic whose family owns the place told me he was trying to get to san diego anyway to visit his brother when he had some time and would tow my car on a trailer off his pick up for short money
i got the ultra star which is the highest wash they do because i have a fast pass service and after my car was done washing it literally sat in the station for 15 mins before anyone touched it even though there were not busy
the quality was similar to if i went through an automatic carwash and took 15 min of my own time to vacuum the inside
i have a parttime 4wd vehicle and its very important to have as little difference as possible between the front and rear tires due to the transfer case between the front and rear acting like a locked differential
they said they would put uniform size tires on if that was what i wanted
if you dont have an oversized vehicle like ours it would probably be a decent selfserve car wash as long as you dont depend on using a credit card
food service and cleanliness was on point
paint on the headlights and grill
the engine light coming on was the cherry on the sundae of a horrific day at work and that alone pushed me over the edge of stress
worth the price to go to the dealership
they even offer a self vacuum
i appreciated the detail they took in wiping both the inside and outside of the car
quit wasting peoples time and gas because you cant schedule
in hindsight i should have but a couple of  trustworthy yelpmigos y yelpmigas had glowing reviews so took the chance
granted its sunday but dont state a time that you cant keep and if you are going to be in a business that requires customer service then please have some
purchased new wheels and switched the old tires with the new wheels
this was recommended to me by a former airline employee  i never park anywhere else now
each one is different and i dont really have a favorite although the beef salad at pin kaow is excellent the curries at komol kitchen are mind blowing the pastes are made from scratch and the larb at ocha is the best ive ever had anywhere
recently i have have an excellent experience with mega city testing facility staff
then he started pricing hoses for another caller
came here 15 years ago to get winter tires
the facility is air conditioned and good for the whole family
she took forever to come and take oure order and when she did she has a smile on her face but seemed disapointed when she had to serve us
by far the best carwash around
lift was real easy to operate
its funny to me how a camry that cost 4000 more only wants 1500 down and he is asking for so much more but i do understand every dealership has different policies so i thought altima just wasnt for me
car got detailed on saturday 4302017 hand washed clay bar and polish  cleaned engine vacuumed interior shampooed carpet seats and floor mats buffed paint dressed tires wiped and cleaned windows inside and out cleaned out all consoles and put items in plastic bag and then returned to me  vacuumed interior looks amazing
fact is they will do nothing of the sorts they promise you the world and deliver nothing
pure arteryclogging heaven
worst carwash i ever had
it was a friday afternoon 90 degrees and my ac quit working
believe it or not they are not the typical mechanic on vegas
i found it interesting that rex responds to every review here on yelp even though he runs a fairly large company
it ended up being something quite small in comparison and they had the part to fix it in stock
we will definitely come back after our three years lease is up
next in comes the closer
apparently i was the only woman who rides that afternoonand i was able to try a new model always thinkin about a changebut cant get rid of my smokey baby
once it was there he looked it over and called me and left a message and asked me to call him back to discuss the estimate
what a gem
let me assure everyone i am not mad at their policy
however i will not rent attempt a rental at this location ever again
he was also kind to fix my washer spray issue for free and offer a helping hand if something doesnt sit right for me
normally i would do it myself but i was 7 months pregnant recently in an accident and couldnt lift the battery
all the local car washes seem to move at a snails pace which i dont understand  part of the reason im willing to pay somebody else to do it is for the speed  convenience
i know theyre in their role because theyre good at sales but if you dont know the answer to something dont freaking make it up
and for more than half of what the dealer had quoted me for a catalytic converter
i would and do highly recommend star service to all mb owners i know and meet
thanks so much
he is an excellent addition to a dealership that is first class in every way
if it wasnt for them thinking outside of the box i would still be in my old car
took maybe 5 minutes to look over everything and we were off on our way to sedona
he wouldnt even tell me what brand of oil they used
i had been corresponding with dennis sanschagrin for a number of months prior to going in for a test drive
i dont know anything about motorcycles because  my husband handles all this kind of stuff
i said why did it take you 2weeks
this car was not in sellable condition and no reputable dealer would have put this on their floor
it was super easy and a totally painless and pressure free process
thats no problem
ill bet i know why  calls to other shops ranged around 20 for install to free if she bought the bulb at the dealer 15ish
brought my mercedes in for brake light issues
i would never buy a car from this place
its the perfect place to recreate a small town gasstop diner experience and a much better gas station stop than 100 of the gas stations ive been to
i had talked to sales manager nissa over the phone prior to coming in
quick helpful efficient
better price than from big o or costco
nope  i would never return to this shop
he helped us and went out of his way to find us a car
i sincerely pity anyone who comes here looking for a good experience
also i specifically asked the bagger please make them heavy i hate bags they will be fine i ended up with one two let of soda per bag i bought4 one pork roast in a bag two cans then he put my cut watermelon on the bottom with three cans of spaghetti os on top
he said he wouldnt know the cost until he saw it and i had to bring it in
be careful  this company advertised one price and charged me another
i was so happy to have this option because i really wasnt up for dropping 135 at the time
mind your step in the selfpark lot its not paved and i stepped into a huge puddle of mud around the car
back to work i go
cant believe it cost me 15
when the other company changed the oil in the car they drained the transmission fluid instead of the oilcrazy will send everyone i know to suns steven paquin jpmorgan financial advisor
this place has definitely gone done hill
i had a wonderful experience with daniel and the work he does is superb
its hard to find a place that can actually clean it well due to the inside is not your typical car plus my dad is in the construction business so dirt is always on the inside everywhere
but i doubt ill get the chance to try that  too many good restaurants in vegas to return to one that left me this underwhelmed
they will be extra harsh on you if you didnt pay the 90 dollars for 3 tries
i thank god for individuals like yourself and the staff that you have
the neighborhood seems a little sketchy but as soon as you walk through their doors youre in another world
not my problem
they did a awesome job fixing my car
so we took them and by now they were melted and not very cold
they drove to where the vehicle was parked
after thinking about it long and hard decided we just wouldnt trade and just to buy the vehicle called the next morning and they had sold it even though the hold was supposed to be on until end of business that day
went in to get a diagnostic on my car because it was slowing down significantly and stalling on the way here to vegas i walked in on accident because i was actually suppose to go next door to zip zap but i asked regardless if they could check it the guy immediately said its going to be 10999 to see whats wrong with it said it would be applied to the job that to me is pretty pricey specially considering that the job itself might cost less
i was a little nervous about the condition of the vehicle because even though it drove really well you never know
took my car in and found out everything i needed to do to make it top of the line again
my experience has been so great with these guys
theyre also reasonably priced
newly rebuilt transmission works fine
he sent me the most ridiculous email saying i was a bully when in reality it was him who was being rude unprofessional and would not listen to anything i was trying to tell him not a way to win over customers richie
hitech automotive pineville is a new business with new owners at the same location
sorry guys i hate writing poor reviews about businesses but i hate having bad experiences as well
update we spoke to the gm don hanson last week 49 and he was very nice  apologetic and wanted to still sell us the car
owner was firing people the turnover is ridiculous
i was in and out for an oil change in 45 minutes
however in this particular circumstance i am compelled to write this review in order that people dont make the same mistake we did
we bought the one tire and continued home
i will never go back ever
they also gave alot of helpful feedback
this company sucks
avoid for car service repairs
teenage daughter found a decent price on the web for what she wanted was a low mileage car where she could finance part of it and earn some credit
so a bit startled i asked what he meant and that i had asked for a quote to do my windows not half of them
will get my car care from them
i explained that i had purchased my tires at sears in 2011 and had the warranty
here are the reasons 1 dishonest quotes to start
i felt like they took a personal interest in fixing my car
the employees are professional and nice
what do you know no loaner available when i get there
thank goodness we were only moving a block or two away from where we used to live
the older female clerk in clothing just stared like i was speaking a foreign language
having shopped around i found this industry is filled with all kinds of shady people doing shady work at shady prices
the second time around 15 weeks went by and the shipment did not come
say you want zero down and they agree then slip in a 444 down payment at the very end of your transaction because they know youre exhausted and just want to get the hell away from their dealership
they fixed the scratches on the headlights they look brand new now they fixed a light that wasnt working inside and fixed the auxilary powerport
after seeing all the positive reviews i went ahead and had victor tint my car
i simply cant say enough about the entire process other than buying a car from them was really like nothing ive ever experienced before
i work in customer service and social service and i know what it takes to run a smooth office with smooth systems in place and this place does not have the latter which is a reflection of the company
things turned around in a positive way when we had a wonderful experience with joe the security of this place
great service fast and many options to pick from
our office uses royal touch and they do a fantastic job
the next day i went there to talk with jeff and here is the surprise i was really frustrated and the whole time was thinking how he would react to this issue
they even worked the numbers so that i could do the lease for 3 years instead of 2 but still with 10000 miles a year
we waited an hour for a shuttle that never came
absolutely love this place
and you bet your butt ride now will be covering it
their service department doesnt seem to want business either
i go to eurotech and jerry sometimes finds the problem is much better than previously diagnosed and always less expensive to repair
you pay a premium but have to wait much longer than what is reasonable
i would like to give them 0 stars based on the complete dishonesty
went in to get a rear light bulb changed
thats how much i value this place
icon explained what had happened and spent extra time replacing my molding for me
i am not even sure why how or with what rhymereason this company exists at the rentacar centre
i popped in here today because ive heard great things about this familyowned car wash and wanted to give it a shot
best car dealership i have ever been to
a week later the tire that i expressed that i thought had a problem popped on the highway
he insisted it was available so we went out to meet with him
we tried it about 10 times just to make sure it would work reliably before bolting it back together
i dont know if they cant or just dont want to trouble shoot the problem
total waste of my time and two months later the car is still there now advertised for less than i offered
explained what happened at firestone and he grabbed a pair of pliers and pulled the screw out
he was very willing to help and said no charge
hope management makes a change and actually makes their workers want to do a good job again
they were all very friendly and knowledgeable even though i showed up very near closing time
they saved me 1750 on a recent repair compared to a quote from ntb
honestly everyone should be refunded at least half of their money for even giving this place the time of day
i remember the customer service my parents received when they purchased my car
okay yeah whatever
called him and he said he would pick it up sunday when he gets back
this is typical heartbeat country well worth a visit
the mechanicowner called me and explained everything in detail and even fixed all four of my headlights for no additional cost
today i came in and they charged me an extra  50 to use my debit card
terrence promised he could do it for under 200
seriously amazing service here
you absolutely cant get better service than at mototire
he says the other car was here first and its been here all day on the ramp
i will never ever buy a car from them
it was a fair price for the amount of work my car needed so i gave them the go ahead and they promised to have it done before i needed to get to work that afternoon
im all about making money but you better not lose what made you great in the first place
after being on the phone with the front desk lady probably about twice a day for 23 weeks after catching her lying and not giving correct information about my car i finally got it back today
as such im not the auto share account holder of the household but as the copilot i have my fair share of experience with this great company
winston was the best car salesman ive had
i travel quite often so im always happy that they pick you up quickly checkout is a breeze and the offer you a cold bottle of water when you pick up your car
i must have a cloud of desert rocks hovering over me
he was able to do this all for 200
i think they could not build the usual size costco due to land costs
for 15 bucks id expect the best exterior wash all they do is up sell you and write on your window that doesnt even come off after your vehicle is washed
ammco mesa made my service experience as good as it can be
unfortunately we did need to purchase from the dealership but they took the time that day to install it since they knew we had come so far new river to have it repaired
upon our return we went over to inspect the work
purchased the part online for 120 and came in saturday and had it replaced in an hour
we bought a 2017 jeep here yesterday great experience from all around
i went in to town and country to see the options i had for trading in my vw gti for a possible new mustang gt
melissa was amazing very professional yet understanding
do not go here  ive been here tons and really liked it
back a few months later
would recommend to any aaa member who is looking for travel information
i dont impress easily however from the moment i walked into the shop until the time i left my experience was exceptional
very quickly nice clean place
the store is clean
i love the fact that they took the time to explain everything that i needed and prioritized the order of importance for repairs
my deal was i thought complete and i was called a week later and was told my interest rate was going to change
customer service at this sams club location is one of the worse i have seen in recent times
so the service estimate that matters most cant be emailed to me i dont trust them to fax it again and i consequently have no choice but to make another trip into the store to pick it up just a little over a month after i initially came in
it looked better then when it was new
ummits a 350 with heavier duty axles
told them after the last chance that i wasnt coming back in again
and salesman said no problem we will fix and seat was broke he said no problem
they really advertise big red which i find interesting as ive never seen it in fountain drink form and its a personal favorite
the former i actually needed the latter was a complete impulse buy since it was a staggering 70 off
i return thursday only to be charged another 300 for the check engine light told it was another issue
art of detail has washed my cars and trucks for the past year and has done an incredible job with great service and prices
thanks mj you rock
i was assured when i bought my volkswagen that their mechanics are certified to work on every type of car
i didnt know what was entailed in a drive clean so they happily gave me a run down of everything and what happens when you dont pass
he shared her contact information with me
prior to jackson taking over the facility i had my car washed there regularly with excellent results
i have been dealing with century for 5 years and i will never go back to them again
all that would be on the voicemail would be a bunch of losers in a room laughing and then it would hang up
my car looks like it came off the dealership floor
josh told me he would meet me at my car
negotiated purchase with brennet of internet sales over the phone
sooner or later we all sit down to a banquet of consequences
we had to have it towed to monroeville
i thought maybe if i was nice and polite i would have a better response but i dont think you can win with people like this
as for the overall food experience here id have to give it 3 stars for sure
i used to visit the jiffy lube on eastern but i went to this location instead this week and i am soooo glad that i did
been going to this sams for a while now and will continue to do so
friendly not pushing parts or service on me that was not needed and always giving me discounts when available
it was a hilarious experience on many levels
auto glass crack was too deep so the attempted repair was free
i entered the store looked around and did not see any restroom signs so i asked the cashier where the bathrooms were
pretty busy poor location
i was impressed right away
not only do they have crappy customer service but they do horrible work fail
but they ended up getting the car of my dreams and i appreciate it greatly
i love helping out local family owned places as opposed to the huge chains but i might have to skip out in this one
i told him about how i jumped the coupon and he offered to bring my printed copy to the dealer to see if they could apply what i already paid
very good customer service qiuck and attentive to my auto needs i am very very happy and my 2 new borns and wife is also very happy with the timely manner the work was completed in and how nice and honest the gentleman was that fixed my ac  my heater was not turning off i had no ac at all which is definatly not good in az and i tried everything my friends and i could think of since we are a bit mechanicly inclined with the nessasary tools we just could not figure it out after much reaserch so i brought my car to eagle auto repair after calling in advance and he fixed my issue with in a matter of minutes after the described simptoms i had with my vw and the price was more than reasonable in my opinion i am in my late 20s and am out of a job currently so that should tell you how much money i am not working with to spend on repairs the mechanics at eagle auto repair are very knowledgable at what they do and very nice and very honest i have been to many many auto shops in the past and have had many different cars and trucks and havent had such great service and luck as this auto shopmechanics my vw is fixed thanks to eagle auto repair thanks for helping me out when i realy needed it i will definatly be back for all my auto needs thanks and god bless
but they are great
took my 1967 british car in for a wheel alignment
plus the service girl was hot as hell
made an appt for the next day
check your car or truck before you leave
keri is in the lot she can look for it
first of all i only bought the car because i was told  by the sales manager mannie my credit was great and i wouldnt need one
i dont question tom at all
i am so glad to have had shawn hucko his patience and extensive product knowledge made her comfortable
management today informed me that they will never get a car clean and dry and they need to move cars through faster
either it causes your corporation to reexamine the customer experience provided in your stores
hooked it up fat with a free tire repair at 8am on a road trip day
we have used omega to inspect our ac units and recently used them to replace a capacitor that went out on our downstairs unit a bryant condenser
we spend millions of dollars in fuel
after reading plenty of good reviews i ignored my instincts and took the wife to lunch here
i took my nissan altima in to have the ac repaired i drop it off at eight in the morning they call me at 11 and say it will be 38500 to fix and shouldnt take more then a couple hours
my major complaint and i have found this is true for most oil change places including other jiffy lubes is that they are always trying to get you to upgrade your oil or perform other costly repairs that you as a car owner may have no idea if are needed
service is wonderful
my previous car was bought at bmw down the street and never did i get this type of customer service
great service for the most part the staff is very friendly and welcoming
on every trip klank generates a lot of interest and i end up giving tours of my tiny house almost every day im camping
their self check out system is a joke its super slow at scanning your items and looking up items is a pain in the ass as well
its no sunflower but when i need some organic fruits or organic snacks eg
im only writing this so that you know today july 8 2016 at 705p the slim caucasian kid that works cashier for you was openly speaking his thoughts on how he felt a man deserved to die because of his past
thanks for showing great customer service
at the edge of the parking lot that is at the se intersection of bell rd
this is my third car i bought for myself  plus 3 cars for friends at this dealership
not up selling the parking or working the customers for tips
each time i get a car washoil change with the most expensive wash each time they leave my cupholders parts of windshield and inside of doorsdash dirty even though i reminded them that i would like them cleaned
also someone from this location followed up with a phone call after my original review but unfortunately i am not near that location to try them again
she looks dealership ready haha
i would recommend him to anyone
who wants maple syrup really
i just want everyone to know if you need a car go see d warren in financing
my car looks like it has never been in an accident
we have been coming here with our car for over two years and never had a problem with them
upon further inspection only 3 tires were glossed
i took my honda fit under their care for 5 years  my lexus ct for one of its major inspections
ive been coming to this carwash for over 5 years
the price is always reasonable for the work done and he never takes more time than necessary we often get our cars back within the day
my fianc was so thrilled when we picked up his baby and he saw the results
they might as well close this place up
long story short altogether i was told it would take about two weeks for the entire build and it took roughly 4 months
we shall see if they refund me back my entire deposit which they should
took 3 minutes or less
we finished our entrees still hungry so we ordered some fried chicken dumplings
this is a great tire shop
the staff was friendly and very helpful
this was monday
we were getting ready to have a big party at our house and my wife was panicky over some of the areas
brilliantly flavoured and great balance of flavours
even if its attached to a dealership for honda lexus mercedes benz nissan toyota pinto volkswagen rolls royce
2000 less than the low price on my range
its cash only but theres an atm inside
i get to the rig and hop in
he quickly got me a price on the tire and said he had 6 in stock
no high pressure sales at berg volkswagen they let me look at the inventory then asked if they could help
hardly any people working the counters and a line of people just waiting
they did a very good job
dropped it off at 8m on monday finally had to go pick it up at 12 noon the next day and they had not even touched it yet
friendly staff and excellent customer service by darrin shattle
now that you have an idea of what i call romance lotus of siam is a great date spot
another rep who dealt with a frustrated customer muttered the joys of dealing with the general public as he walked away from her
i just purchased a cpo bmw here and can not be more displeased
i was in vegas for a couple days and had to have a meal due to at least 5 recommendations from friends
i even took the car back and the service rep was very irritated and his verdict at the end it is an old car what do you expect
reasonable prices great customer service they definitely want to make sure that you are happy with your choice
theres plenty of seating inside
while there winston also filled the steering fluid since it was low
i recently performed a search on consumer reports website for used certified 2013 toyota avalons
honesty has gone from this business
the sticker should have said 78000 miles
doesnt get much better than this
i waited several about 45 minutes for the service manager to appear
i was very impressed with his knowledge and his desire to run a first class shop
bottom line  procrastinators and upchargers
if this site allowed us to use 10 stars as a rating we would give exclusive collision center 20 stars
i asked to talk to a different representative and they transferred me to the parts department who never picked up the call
so i had to pay for the emissions test twice
due to a divorce and other credit issues i did not have the best credit
ie  look up  charlotte article xi
absolutely no pressure salesmanship
i wish i could give negative stars
on ma propos des solutions originales  des problmes que javais
mega friendly and sooo speedy
and i will always refer everyone i know to come here
also the manager refused to provide a copy of my contract and they still keep the deposit
they have a customer for life
turned our i had a leaky valve
the finance manager appears with the ridiculous verdict of we are requiring that your wife be on the loan as well
then they changed the manager the new manager told me that the pipes on the front and side were leaking and it is very dangerous to drive hmmm leaking but my driveway wasnt stained he told me itd be 1200 to 1900 to fix the issue
in 2012 i went to kia and got a bad deal
they diagnosed and said bad fuel pump
i highly suggest you do not go to auto bell
great service all around
very unprofessional and dishonest
would highly recommend servicing your vehicle here
that involves taking out some bolts and moving the crossmember and drilling holes to install new ones
stereotypical stealership bs and yet people in the automotive industry scratch their heads and wonder why they have such a piss poor reputation
a few minutes had passed and finally the manager or whoever he was arrived
the guy was really nice and told me coupon would go towards the price
i have left a message for the manager with the receptionist and i called back today and asked to be transferred to leave a message on the managers voicemail i have not heard back yet
i usually know that my car is done way before jason my service guy comes to find me
it wouldnt start and we jump started it but it didnt go far
except you could almost pass travis off as a justin beiber look a like
we also had a friend that was with us who is going to sdsu for grad school
she was there with in about 20 minutes and loaded it up fast and took it to the location requested
this made me believe that it was handled and we went back to life as normal
they were extremely accommodating took everything out for me cleaned the entire car to perfection and put everything back
these clowns overcharged my cc with insurance i didnt even need because according to them its the law in ohio
we had a slow leak in the front drivers side tire and they helped us take care of it quickly
highly recommend using this company for any work needed to be done on your car
doing the front brakes with all the parts available only takes about 45 min
yeah i can find a guy somewhere wholl change the oil for 30 40 whatever
first i would like to say this place is the worst place to buy a car from
i purchased my vehicle here mid 2013 i will admit i was sold
i would buy a new car before having these people work on my car
they do not pressure you to buy or push a car
i made an appointment for them to check out an rv i was thinking of buying
i took the van in for its first oil change at larry h miller dodge
a 1mth and a 17mth old
they asked me what i feel comfortable  paying
i sent my vehicle there for inspection as i have been trying to sell it and my buyer is waiting for the inspection to be completed so we can finish the transaction
he said he would have to order them and he would call me
toby is as good as it gets
20 and your car is basically detailed from bumper to bumper
kyle showed us one more truck and we test drove it then we bought the truck
there are 2 guys working on each car and the lane where my car is theres just one guy who is as slow as a turtle
i will consider them in the future
there were no other cars being worked on and 2 workers were taking a smoke break
okay so they get one more star
at this time i got upset and said what the hell does that have to do with you guys fixing my tire
he said he would go look at my tire and give me a quote
they do a really nice job
ohhh and at the end of the call with adam he tells me you should find another dealership to get your work done dont come here
i will be returning again for a visor strip
drew could have let me deal with the headache of the intake manifold on my own but he went out of his way to do a little research for me
i told them over 15 times to stop calling me
truly disappointing and irksome
you specifically told her that you would get her her refund but it would have to wait until after the holidays since you were so busy
i love this about walters automative
not only was the price more than fair but they also got the work done super fast
i came in at 3pm with a chunk of metal in my tire
there is no pressure or heavy sales tactics
john gave us perfect directions and had already diagnosed the problem by the time we got there
well the dealership gave the towing company incomplete information the first time then gave the wrong phone number when they attempted a second communication
scott made scheduling easy payment easy coordination  all the basics you look for  5 stars
im guessing at this point they were counting on that response
no bubbling so far
the garlic chicken wings were tasty
i feel that they gave me a totally fair assessment of the issues the car was experiences and patiently explained everything and gave me a few options as to how they could proceed
since brian had to pick up a vehicle he wasnt there when i walked in but one of his employees helped me
the dealership is currently being renovated so things are a bit crowded in the showroom but im sure that will improve when the renovations are finished
my problems have been taken care of quickly and
we really liked the fact that you work with one person from the start to the end we hear
i ask to speak to cooperate and he gives me the number  problem 5 my oil change purchase was july 8th 2017 with is a saturday
we do most everything but we refer our upholstery work to the top shop   nice guys good work
i cant believe they treat their costumers this way
these people are pros
ugh seriously wth i went in looked around and didnt see what i needed
a unique mix of grifters tourists and regular folk
they were super nice professional and best of all quick
as the previous poster alluded i too would use their service again for future vehicles
only reason i gave then a star is because you have chose at least one
best suspensionalignment shop in town
i can understand this but justin promised us different payments
i apologize for the wait as we are all currently handling other guests
his services were impeccable and having 2 little kids my car was filthy
my combs my sons gloves my handicap sticker
i love that there is a lot of places to sit and wait inside and out and they have a wide variety of options for drinks and snacks even some nutritious although you have to seek them out in their retail store
doug is a great mechanic who put a new engine in my beloved 96 camaro and has taken great care of it for years
he had my windshield replaced within 20 minutes
nice friendly people and the prices are right
40 was a super reasonable price and the legs out from the main chip are almost invisible
the food is fantastic great menu items
and well thanks to them i cant have a car freaking jks
even though its a longer drive to verona it would have saved a lot of time to just go there first
we called ahead and found out that our rv was ready
i have never had an issue with any work on either vehicle over the last few years
in addition the mechanic said the software he used to diagnose my audi had not specified clearly of what maintenance needed to be taken care of
the service advisors are always helpful and they offer complimentary tickets for a coffee soda or snack when you checkin your vehicle for service
same day installation great price and best of all excellent customer service
i received very good customer service from several different workers on several of my trips in to get information on units ubox and other items
i am extremely satisfied after eating the sliced brisket sandwich
the repair is covered and the guy should get paid
they changed my oil and immediately it started leaking
i took it to the ford dealer
i have had his attention all day from about noon till now 745pm
my advice dont believe the first sales person you talk to
though i think thats a basic that should not have been missed in the first place
they were all professional and polite and quick on their feet
i was less than thrilled that the wheel deal was not included with ncws priciest wash and suffice it to say i was pissed when after paying an extra 4 for the wheel deal my vehicles wheels still looked grungy postwash  frankly the results of the ultimate wash looked like any runofthemill 799 wash the kind of quick wash you get every week or two during the winter just to get most of the salt off
he flicked his hand at the salesman as if he didnt want to be bothered anymore and closed his office door
my old toyota edging up on 200000 miles yep i drive em hard had a blow out in the connecting pipe between the muffler and converter
we rented a pair of bicycles for the middle week of a 2week trip to montreal
very satisfied customer and will continue to buy my tires here in the future
i came here for the 1st time about 6 months ago
i took my car to have some motor mounts changed out and they had it done in no time flat and great prices even the parts were cheaper than anywhere i could find
i had originally looked to replace my lease in la but my mom couldnt make it down so i went back to desert audi
i was very clear over the phone with him before the lift was installed that the new lift was going to be fully functional when the work was completed and he assured me yes
they treat everyone with class and respect doesnt matter if your buying a late model used car or a new bmw
the engine that i had replaced was entirely their fault as well
apparently being younger and female means its ok to tell you your car needs well over 1000 of unnecessary work for the tires back brakes and coolant flush
my husband  i recently brought our vehicles in for tint and just loved the service
halfords have limited stock due to poor sales of footwear at seafield with similar story at hermiston gate only they had one more expensive pair of shimano bike shoes at 9999 with this in mind after two stores  no way was i even going to venture to their third  straiton
our maiden voyage in our new rig and as luck would have it our slide out got stuck
not only is jrs work excellent he is very professional
no problem so far as im concerned since the car was either parked in my sisters yard all alone in mesa or in the valet section of the mgm grand in vegas what could possibly have happened
i politely reiterated that id rather just have the refund for the aforementioned reasons and the manager told me if we gave a refund to every unhappy customer wed never make any money
ive been a motortek client for many years
he was extremely pleasant and very informative
i even go there for oil changes just to say hi
they are very professional in all their dealings
and you can too
eddie answered and after i explained my dilemma he expressed true concern for my safety while driving the car and said hed be more than happy to take a look  would even run a code to at least let me know what was going on
stephan huor the service adviser who helped me was wonderful
tell everyone go see for yourself
his focus on each and every visit is to make sure you are 200 satisfied and pleased with their service standards
the first girl that helped me caroline was pleasant but she had to leave
take your hands off the wheel put it in n and enjoy the ride through the car wash when you reach the end you will take a left towards the vacuums and guess what
prudent is a much better alternative when you need a quick loan
im a stereotypical female who knows jack squat about cars so if anybody could get ripped off its me
like that is doing me a favor
one happy customer
if a private company can have a better presents that a government agency then that is disappointing
they also install tint for some of the auto dealers in charlotte so you know their work is good
very caring and trustworthy shop owner and mechanics
might have to find another car wash
thank you for the great service stan spencer martin bryce and jc brooks
thirty minutes later they called me to ask approve a 4800 diagnostic check
4 called them and emailed them again for reimbursement as i had my free minutes and was lectured how i should have used the incar app and got refused for the reimbursement
he told me that the light could mean a wide variety of things  that if i took it to autozone they would use a scan tool for free that will give me the specifics of what is wrong
i fully believe they broke my car and it cost 500 to repair
this place is a rip off
second time nissan has proved to be the shadiest car dealership
a highlight was them coming to keffer with a rollback to pick up my car  bringing it back when my car was ready
its easy to see why kellys is among the top tier of auto mechanics in town
he then said well let me check to see if i can fit you in
original smog check price is 1199 but with a checkin brings it to 777   be sure to mention the check in prior to them starting the paperwork
needless to say i will never be a customer of acura north scottsdale again
i have been looking religiously for a car that i could fall in love with
they checked the alignment again and re did the balancing for me
it would have easily been known had they bothered to look into their shop
i would go in every two weeks for hand wash amd armor all
i know they are not like cars and things go wrong
geoff ganes the owner introduced himself and he and two other employees got right to work
we have been coming here for years to get our cars washed and quick detailed and they do a good job
i plan on going back to him with my car needs
my truck is happy too
you know the ones i am talking about old worn chairs stuffed inside a room the size of a childs closet with a vending machine and a tv set to maury
i have been taking my jeep here for years to the service department
but thats it for me
the attendant is a nice guy but dont break his rules
this is a great place
i have been buying and servicing our cars there for many years
snack bar another way for toyota to make money is the snack bar downstairs
i gave him a coupon and he noticed i had a jiffy smog coupon and gave me an additional discount
they were honest about what i needed and didnt need to have done
it came out looking like a 7 year old cleaned it
it looked nicely done
i am extremely satisfied with the job done
i could go on but i blame myself for leaving without looking as much as i should have
found wallys on yelp and went to get a low beam headlight replaced
the price for gas was 3559
holy dirty tables
i figured it would be very expensive
they said wheni get the key to come back
the first time i ended up taking a bus and tried to call to cancel my cab however could never ever get through
he ran my paperwork and we looked at only one vehicle that fit the description of what i was looking for
2nd time to pick up my car now and by the time im home all my dashboard lights are on and the car is putting never ever an issue before
swapped it out it sounded great once again and i was on my way
at the very least wash your customers cars before you return them
lifetime warranty on the repairs
they are scam artists
all right in front of me
dont think i can find another tire establishment with that type of service
he sees the tire and he knows what i need
not very happy with the service was there few days ago was trying to fuel and the outside cc machine didnt work so i had to go to 3 pumps just to get it work  not good it needs to be fixed for next time
i only had my back glass tinted on my truck
we said we had plans and would come in the morning
they did the alignment and had me in and out in like an hour
their prices are reasonable
drop off the car and waited an hour before someone talks to me
we find out when we went to fill the gas tank the first time that there was no gas cap which i find funny because spencer put gas in there himself and didnt say anything about a missing gas cap
you cant afford to stock the food bar
if the action of taking up their spaces were such an issue they would ensure that their parking is clearly marked every sale saturday which rotates on a biweekly basis
30 minutes later got the call car is ready nothing is broken but jonathan says bring it in tomorrow and well have a technician look at it
ive been working on my credit for the last 8 years and finally have an excellent rating
my spirit said to get a second opinion and im so thankful i did
he did not stop there
all of my questions and concerns are always answered and im never ripped off
they also referred and drove me to a car rental place and were giving me updates as my car was getting fixed
he seemed to lose the slight interest he had in helping us when we told him we preferred to buy a certified used vehicle
phoenix is lucky to have them
ninety plus minutes later my number is called
the next day they gave me an estimate thats 13 of the price that the other shop gave me
all of the repair advisors especially bob and rex have been great ensuring that the cost if not covered by warranty would reasonable
my vehicle was imitially brought to sands for the replacement of a rear window regulator and servicing of the tire monitoring system and from the start matt and i were on thin ice
i wasnt asking for a magic wand but just to help diagnose and fix a issue
they actually fixed a problem that another shop had caused
not only that but i was in and out of there in maybe 30 min for the one window
made me feel like i was stupid for not knowing what i neededthen deciding a small 6x12 trailer didnt need a 14000 lb haul capacity
cant blame them for the compressor as it probably went out while i was using the ac with a leak but still
thanks so much for the honest advice and help
we decide to test drive mainly to see if i like the patriot in general
if your looking for a preowned vehicle definitely check out enterprise car sales
i had a 3 oil change deal with big o  the last time i got an oil change they told me my cabin air filter was missing
then i was told i needed a tire which would be 8999 base price i got one for 40 at discount tire
i cant tell if it were the guys collecting the buggiesthey were having too much fun
if you want your alignment done right these are your guys
tired of even when they wash the car for me i still have to tell those guys that something is still dirty and to top it off with giving me attitude
they were able to get a diagnosis together right away so at least i knew what was wrong and it was substantial
now if you bought their e xtended warranty they will fix it
the pfaff group also has a mclaren and audi franchise and a performance division as well
a week later my car started to make the same noise
im not going to stop taking my vw to be serviced at a vw service station but i just might have to try somewhere else in the valley after such a poor experience here
yes im paying a bit more with markham bmw but id rather buy from a dealer that values me as a customer and has the common courtesy to treat me as a human being
i booked an excursion for a group of 20 people
it was downhill from there
i would gladly recommend cobblestone to anyone
if you want fast service good prices and friendly associates go elsewhere
on top of all that when i got the bike back they had wiped it down and shined it up
i thought it was all good but as soon as i left my car started smoking and my check engine light came on
it is very difficult to navigate entering and exiting
so decent bbq but cool environment
hands down the best vehicle purchasing experience to date
and the cadillac sales guy lacked confidence in the product that he was selling stating youre not here if youre worried about safety youre here for an image
today when i went in for my scheduled oil change i was questioned on whether i had an appointment or not i was advised that i didnt have an appointment and that they would still take care of my oil change but it would take hours
recently i had him install a 18 jack into the back of my car stereo so i could plug in my mp3 player great investment as those fm transmitters are worthless
tory you and your crew do excellent work
fast forward to today i decided to try batteries plus
they always do a solid job and i feel bad that they have to work in the heat all day
im not a tool fetishist they dont have to be name brands or even brand new
when i asked about it they said they dont do the inside
i also asked to have my tire check i was having some noise from one of them
when i walked in i was greeted and my car was taken back within 20 minutes
oh and we love our 2016 outback
no call ever came
everyone at the shop are good people
from the very first brians care and professionalism and pure tenacity in finding us the car we wanted was second to none
wasnt thrilled about the window tinting and remote start charges but they gave me the more for my trade in then two other dealerships and had the car i wanted
he said i have to see if its making noise you know squealing
i normally go to dannyt but i happen to need a car wash last minute and this was the only option
bmw of henderson rocks
they know their tires are helpful with recommendations but never pushy for a sale
when i told him i was not interested in leasing at all and that id just like to get my car key back from the trade in appraisal he got up grabbed the numbers paper and crinkled it up very loudly as he was walking out of the cubicle
so lets recap for the skimmers 1 salesmen are like vultures circling the parking lot hoping you pull into a spot next to them
this company is great at what they do have a nice professional environment
ich kann die schlechten bewertungen nicht nachvollziehen
he took a little bit of time having to research the coupon details but in the end he gave me the discount
after the work the car was parked in a tight space next to a huge truck so she had to call one of the mechanics to move it a recurring theme at the baseline big o
i asked her to do it anyway as i wasnt in a rush
hope only to see them again for small things
2 of which have been used
my experience was great
no previous history of last two could be foundlast two changes totaled 2798 with a coupon for conventional oil change
he is always friendly and engages you in a conversation for the entire smog check
the car look good enough to be on a show room floor
the mechanics are all nice guys
had to wipe the whole car down cause it rained on the way home and the finish felt like there was no wax on it
honest and fair prices
keys are already inside
he was demeaning in the delivery of his answers any time we asked a question
after giving my description of the problem spiel to the receptionist she said dominic from the service department would call me right back
i know i can trust them
i used a coupon and still paid 24 for the smog and 10 extra to update my registration
the car came out clean and they did an okay job vacuuming there were still a couple pieces of dirtlint here and there but no big deal
youre ready to go
can you say crooked
i just bought a brand new chevy equinox
thank you century towing saved me over the long weekend from baker
from the minute i called them to my two trips to them i received the best customer service and care
you just never know if youre going to come back home with lemonade or just the same rotten lemon you started with and a couple of game tokens left in your pocket
its just barely within my payment threshold but understands with generosity and with a smile
i love supporting local businesses but local businesses need to get with the timesmake appointments
clear  no smudges or streaks between the film and glass
the girl at the door was super nice and made me feel very welcome
i came once with an appointment and once without to get an oil change and i dont think having an appointment helps at all
this is the last time i come to a circle k  im only going to qt from now on
by far the most pleasant car buying experience ive ever had
i love my newpre owned volvo
what a joke
this place used to be so good
nobody wanted to set it
my daughter and i love this dealership and the way we are always treated there
never going back again
headache after headache
my name is everything to me and if im going to refer somebody theyve got to be the best because all my customers will remember is me when they get that sour taste in their mouth from a poor referral
but the salesman was okay with trying to sell me new tires for over 600 rather than fulfill my current warranty
we were amazed at how easily he could bring the sun baked paint back to life
when i returned i could see that the guys had done a completely professional job that even with the lifetime warranty will last for quite a long while
i highly recommend this gas station above all else
most restaurants have trouble with that on a busy night
its not of those 99 tint places that uses cheap tint he uses quality product and stands behind his work
so if youre a wine lover youre in for a treat
i found david when i had drove across town to get my tint done by another vendor at the park n swap
they vacuumed and i left my car at the wash while i went next door to eat breakfast at burger king
car wash 3 ok third review of car wash facilities on the west side
yeah this ones not in the best neighborhood but i dont shop here at night
unless you got money to spend and will jump at the first deal they give you  dont
after receiving one of the most laughable quotes ive ever seen i know dealerships are bad but this was worse than gouging i drove it off the lot and took it over to jim winter
i usually will go somewhere else even though this place is the closest to my house just because i dont feel comfortable or like dealing with that parking lot
they kept it another day because they couldnt get it to happen and still had no luck
gave me great in site on tires
right temp excellent
look like high end car dealership but the way the finance personnel try to get you a deal like used car dealers bait and switch
we highly recommend these guys as thy went above and beyond all our expectations
so then i made an appointment for the next morning and then the owner texted me saying they could plasti dip my vehicle the same day an hour and a half later
just got back from getting my second car tinted here and they did a great job
ive never had to return for anything and ive never seen anything but fantastic quality on all three instances where i took my damaged vehicle to brads
all the work was done within 30 minutes
i will never ever take my car to mark kia
i was at my wits end with my current shop 125 hr assuming you get what you pay for i had no problem with the rate however on this specific situation i was wrong
i dont have to traverse a maze or solve a sudoku puzzle to determine or pay the monthly bill
was this service 599 from great clips of course not
he tried to charge me 7500 for 1300 tweeters
he drives it around like a friggin lunatic and then says its a motor issue
these guys are top notch
sweet deal  he didnt even push for me to get an extended package unlike cobblestone employees who push way too much of that shit on you
no issues with the shuttle and enterprise made sure you knew were you were going asking if we needed directions before leaving and advising on the terminal  after dropping the car off
after they fix the brake the car is still not derivable
ive used the printing house for work on a few occasions and have always been more than impressed
the steering hose was leaking and they replaced it for free
btw this is my 2nd trip there first trip was to have my yoshimura rs5 exhaust packed bc they were the only shop on cave creek rd with the proper rivet gun to rivet back my exhaust can
even an oil change takes forever
its beyond awkward when you oh well
kelly the owner was very attentive and responsive to any questions i have prior and during my visit
they cannot find a car for us
we thought that maybe he was on the phone and waited for a good while it was near closing and we were the only ones in the parking lot but he still didnt get out
i will be doing business with them from now on
we paid more down in tucson at a place that we still had to drive our cars into
he helped me find the right windshield wipers and installed them
after constant calls on my end to get updates and nothing but excuses on their end i finally picked the car up myself
i own a 2014 silverado 1500 i didnt buy it from this dealership but its the closest one to my house so i decided to bring my truck here for service regarding my rear leaf springs making noise
i have loved my 2014 jeep grand cherokee overland for 2 years 11 months and 36286 miles
then he told me what they were going to do
i cant wait for my lease to be up so i can come here and get a new car
brian was able to squeeze me in their busy service schedule because my rear break lights were not working and this was a safety concern and i should not be driving with no rear break lights
i found this place on yelp and it was highly recommended by most people so i gave it a shot
whether youre selling your car or just want that new car look call these guys
meaning someone who doesnt have a passenger riding
i have to say 4 wheel parts came through just like they say they would
i was able to get into the truck i wanted and stayed within my budget
i would highly recommend them
overall this is an easy going laid back no pressure business that was a positive memorable customer experience for me
i took my bike to ridenow on rancho after being a long patron of ridenow on boulder
they did a great job
he let us wait inside where there were snacks and drinks while he went out in the heat to find the vehicle we were interested in
i dont know that there are many other fullservice washes like this especially now that octopus is gone
great great great
ive never found anybody who would do anything cheaper
went down to the shop and the gentlemen who helped me was great
good price though
im going back today to get my brakes worked on
it really says a lot about a business as most places now hire rude staff
whats a pizza and 6pack really worth
this check was received over a month ago
the guy writing me was extremely impersonal
what did he expect to happen when he put up the amazon voucher without limiting the number to a manageable amount
got a whole car to dispose of
i found sunset autos positive ratings where consistent throughout
again no one showed or has returned my phone calls
while an hours worth of labor can cost upwards of 90100 for repairs like changing the cars bulbs joe only charged me for 20 minutes of service
slowly we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air
they began telling me it may be an underlying issue basically i dont take care of my vehicle when i always take my car to honda for maintenance
even though he knew i would not be buying anything that day he was patient and still took the time to show me the ilx i was interested in and all of its features and we talked a little bit about different options and vehicles
these guys are hands down the best
the place was fast friendly and my bill was reasonably priced
i even emailed them no reply
this want the only thing that was missed
while im outside trying to figure out wtf to do
sadly due to our most recent experience customer service is why we will never go to nor recommend it to others
now almost two years after i have purchased this car after i have had validation from the original dealership about the poor shape it was in when it was sold to me they continue to bash me here and claim i am slandering them when they absolutely will not own up to anything they claimed anything they promised or the agreements we made about my trade in which they had complete information on
my son brough his car in for a simple wheel allignement
and they even polished her for me
this circle k is right off the west side of the 101 and it can be a very busy store during normal business hours and sometimes even after sundown
dave said the repairs would take 4 days
nothing but good things to say about them
tire is replaced now one tire no need to replace in pairs like i normally do with all my vehicles and is recommended by almost all mechanics
rick daniel was the service technician who serviced the car and he is the type of guy you like to have as your next door neighbor and best friend
what we thought was a radiator replacement that would be done by noon turned  out to be a complete cooling system failure
i could have spent 30 at the dealership and be in and out in 50 mins and a more informational inspection on my car
he apologized because the previous management team made a mistake in repairing my car
i checked with brians tire pros and they got me the same exact tires for 41500 out the door
i found another location and they now have my business
no big deal i said ill call and speak to title
the shop that has the car told us no one is returning his calls either
not sure if all tire shops do this but i got a complimentary fix
i felt like i needed to bring it up to the manager
this place was awesome
we filled out the forms saying that we were interested and got a call back in a timely manner
i told him to remove ldw
when im in a bind i think to call trent first
the ceramic coating they use really makes my cars shine i wouldnt let anyone else touch my cars i highly recommend the best detail
had an appointment for some routine maintenance and as usual the guys made me feel like i was in good hands
we walk over to parts my dad starts joking around about it being installed for free and the parts agent states if its not on the due bill i cant
to top it off some jerk salesman tried to joke around that he would do my repairs for me
oh yeah
this way the price is set and it eliminates up selling
they even did some extra work at no charge
thank you  sharpshine
and he was joking but only a smidgin
id go back here if i ever need any other exhaust work done
i am being grossly overcharged for returning a vehicle early
needless to say i fd up  yes i did
i will continue to bring my vehicles here for diagnoses and the occasional repair
i said well ok i guess i dont have a choice do the more expensive synthetic  i sat down inside and looked up my motor oil and found several conventional 5w20 oils
took it down the street the next day and the other guys fixed my axles
they didnt replace the battery so i had to bring the car back a 2nd time
five stars for food no question
id give a 5 star rating but im holding out to see if he can work on a future 20062008 bmw 650i purchase
i found the whole experience to be professional from sales to my conversations with chris the finance manager
i was furious
i wouldnt buy any other car or take it anywhere else for service
brandon was just as nice as could be and listened to our needs and concerns about the car
you can lock in a good price if you make a reservation on websites like on priceline 2 weeks before like i did and i saved at least 100 on a 2 day rental
my husband and i were very disappointed after our most recent trip to this location
all he said was that hell speak to her and then said let me get this car clean so i can get you out of here faster
i hope i have all of the pieces
i have read made in america sam waltons autobiography and he would roll over in his grave to see this location
my contact has always been rick and not only is he just on it hes really funny and down to earth
bbq sauces on table lacked flavor as well
come out an hour later and there is oil all over my drive way
my car feels itself again
he informed us that we didnt even need an oil change yet
the duck had a nice crispy skin on the top and the meat was nice and juicy
or at the very least never buy one of their extended warranties
as you exit the wash pull around to make use of the free vacuums under covered parking spaces
hasslefree i  trust them 100 with my cars
they also made sure i saw all similar competitive models on the lot
he emailed me several times after that asking when i wanted to come test drive the truck that had already been sold
they really know their stuff
i would recommend to anyone
they give been taken care off a whole new meaning
his patience with me and ability to answer all of my questions with ease was remarkable
nancy the shuttle lady was super friendly and awesome
smitty does a great job at a great price
the service at bobby rahal is honestly top notch
i just bought my car here
chris the manager helped me my words here cannot express how polite and professional he was
the front desk clerk insisted several times that they wouldnt accept it and a few minutes later the manager likewise insisted on the same thing
the older people who should have known better all they did was complain and gripe about other people
if you want a reliable and courteous car detailing company this is absolutely not it
dont know how he got to be assistant gm but it definitely cannot be his people skills or eagerness to help
they did a fantastic job matching the tent to my existing smoked glass windows
tech was friendly and fast
i have launched every complaint i can imagine against them
she made a stink face and said why would i have that
i cannot say enough of how professionalsal they all were
from the owner giving you pricing to his team that checks you in
i also had my brakes changed while they had it
couple of weeks ago i was told i get all discounts from the store as uber driverl including carls jr that is why i go there to eat wash and rest a bit before my next drive
i feel that owning a cadillac is a luxury but the service you receive at earnhardt cadillac is what will make me a lifelong cadillac owner
i finally lost it and called parts demanded they track it down
i immediately went over to right toyota and looked at a 2013 camry
robin did a great job designing a poster for our band
all in all the service people seemed to be very knowledgeable and helpful
back on the road in less time than quoted and not a penny out of pocket to remove a screw
super close to the airport easy and fast
if you are real nitpicking and you want it done right i would suggest you bring your car to them
even if you dont need motorcycle gear you can find something you like here
although i was totally exhausted by the time i was one
i was dealt with some unknowledgeable staff members and after the service i received today i do not feel confident about their expertise level at all
if you get the app they have some the best deals  coupons
i was there on good faith
i call the dispatcher directly its now 430 25 hours since the initial call and i have only an hour to get my car to the mechanic
down payment i gave them for 72 hours after they inspect the car for any damage  excessive mileage
please be very careful and examine your car upon renting it
new owner new policy no loaners
they called me out to confirm placement of a windshield strip before just placing like most places would regardless of how low the owner would want it
i dont like that you have to use debit card and they charge you a fee to use it
the sales person says to my face that im talking too much
looks amazing if you want your vehicle detailed give them a call
my mother in law has reminded me several times since we have been there that they have gas attendants
andreas came and picked me back up in my clean car they had washed and vacuumed
he supposedly had to pull 20 cars from around back which is bullshit ive been there with my friend who owns another shop they cant even fit 20 cars back there   i felt a little bad i just wanted my tire and to go home but that is so rude
had to come back mar 30 2016  for hood shock installation since they didnt have it at first place and they had it ready this time
this is not the case at sanderson
i had to ask to see the car i wanted to see five times before he proceeded to walk out with me to inspect it
took 20 minutes and looks brand new
definitely convenient with good snack and drink choices
if i get a better deal at another dealership i want to know whether youll match that
when its all gone they will choke every cent and penny out of you
love this place
not the case at all about a week or two later i noticed a small leak of oil on my floor under the suv
took the car home
thanks sun auto
its a plaza issue not fault of the company conclusion   my automobile is 11 years old and has been to 4 dealershipshop through its lifetime
if you want to make sure to get in call for an appt
so worth the money
it turned out flawless
my check engine light came on and they didnt tell me because they said they thought i knew about it
i came in on a saturday and there was a long line of people here to get their cars cleaned
except turn it over to the corporate engineer
the color is apparently a dead give away because the quality tint doesnt fade like that and it just peeled right off
i wanted to haggle a price and tried hard to but there was little wiggle room
perhaps i have been thinking i should sell it at a cut throat price to someone capable of taking on the pretty simple repairs and fund my dream purchase of an xc70
shopping here is a truly uncomfortable experience
long story short they checked the check engine light for free
sure enough  my battery was on its way out and even though they had to order the one my car needed i was still on my way in less than an hour
if not please go to a place where you know you can be treated with respect decency and of value
i was forced to file a complaint with the better business bureau in order to get a response
got them back about a week later and i cant pick out which wheels were damaged vs the the ones that were perfect
i asked him to make sure they were in inventory because i was driving out there and didnt want to see anything else
which pushed our entire day back several hours
this one never stocks the silver red bull
my brakes are better than when i first purchased my car
despite my terrible experience buying a used car from them last week since they lied to me and added extra charges to my invoice that i stated i didnt want and lied about not being able to give me 2 keys or a manual for my certifed vehiclebut they ended up rewinding the deal
and on top of that i have to wait who knows how long to get my money back to start this god awful process all over again
my tires have been removed and installed at ted wiens at least 3 separate occasions and they never said a word
we asked if they could work on it late or on saturday to no avail  they had a show and that took priority over us
great pricing and fast service
and theres only one other car when i came thru
10 mins later he comes back and says that they really need my information and credit card to prove im serious before they can provide me with a quote
i have a new baby so car safety is very important to me
way better than my portable vacuum at home
i was angry and let her know it
also for every 10 degrees fahrenheit  is 1psi
just be aware that he prefers cash for his work i guess he had one too many bad checks
no apology or any type of compensation from them
i came across this hidden gem by word of mouth and was able to get five brand new tires for less than 500 angel is your go to man if youre in need of assistance
i still get calls from the salesmen even though i told them i already bought a car
he even took extra steps to give me a unit as close as possible to the elevator to facilitate a small part of the move that id have to do myself
this was a 5 star auto buying experience from beginning to drive off
i told them i just needed the breaks and rotors i originally asked for and they came back with 700
the salesman was nice and friendly and put us at ease
went to pay for my items display wasnt working so i couldnt view the itemization of my items paid and started walking out
if the website says an item is in the store chances are it is not
you could add wax for a couple more dollars
they do not stock some of the most common parts
i called him back on 4182017 at 1015am and left a message with my name and cell number
thank you lotus of scottsdale and danny rains for making this transaction a pleasurable experience
i also was able to get the alignment taken care of at the same time as getting new tires which the competition cant do
i recommend this place to all my friends and family very trust worthy
so i ask him is this final
altho the other day i did see some people wearing daisy dukes with bikinis on top
he was very patient during test drives and various visits to the dealership
gary and his staff are friendly and professional
frank is an awesome guy and very honest
he wouldnt let it go and was being extremely abrasive
he returned my call within 15 minutes and im all set with an appointment to handle my endoflease paperwork
i had gotten a flat and drove in on my donut
the total price of the repair was astronomical
doesnt really mean anything when you have to be asked for an apology and told how to do your job
not a big fan of this place
was it in the truck
they conducted a couple other tests and showed me that i would probably need a battery soon but didnt try to sell me one
the guy which im assuming was      management or the owner was super friendly and wasnt pushy at all about their monthly plans which i love
there was no intimidation factor at gateway and as a young female i really appreciate that
i strive to take care of my purchases especially big ticket items like vehicles
easy onto and off of the freeway
so i drove up during lunch and they were able to get me in right away
this store sits on the corner of arrowood and south tryon
i asked for recommendations from several neighborhood facebook groups im a part of and simons was the one that got the most recommendations
but like i said before out of sight out of mindi guess i am in visible and if you have a problem with them they will go out of their way to ignore you
i ended leaving with 20000 contract full of services that were poorly explained
well when we picked the car up something didnt seem right but we though nothing of it at the time
tells me the lock will have to be drilled out
it has already spotted and they werent going to run it back through
they only have 2 cashiers too so the line can build up pretty fast but their organization skills arent as good as sheetz
thats right  gas is included
now after speaking with josh  the car was ok so that wasnt a problem
there is never an excuse for yelling at a customerever
the customer service people i dealt with were friendly but that wasnt enough to make up for the scheduling issue
who did i call
have to admit at first i avoided exoticar paint works due to some bad yelp reviews
i love this place
furthermore jason put the car on a lift and gave it a once over and pointed out a few additional maintenance items needed and quoted reasonable prices without any sales pressure at all
they did an awesome job
this is the worst place in the world
i have had a difficult time trusting auto mechanics esp the dealers around here so when i found they had the bbb recommendation i was willing to try them out
out of all the auto repairs in town he was the only one that actually answered my call
thenwhen i did not hear back from anyone that day i called back again and al of a sudden when they were testing the car out the fans blew out
092913 bright and clean outdoors
ronnie is credible and professional hank  fonzi know their stuff man
i park in parking spot 2 and the customer service is fantastic
ive never had an issue with this place the service the employees or the prices
so at best audioexpress are incompetent and unprofessionalat worst almost criminal
so on christmas eve i called tobias and they said they would be open until noon
im literally ready to give thousands to a nice friendly accessory dealer in exchange for a little parts and service  that will never happen here
hes a wonderfully trustworthy mechanic and the best in the business
he also gave me a discount for scheduling a same day appointment
he refused to let us even walk across the barrier to the cars unless we went inside their building first
i was told that reason the light was still on was not their issue to fix
all i can say is thank goodness i am obsessive about saving all the receipts for my car repairs
great and fast service making an appointment helps on a busy day
it didnt make sense to me but i agreed to return the next day for a new glass only estimate
contrast that with the porsche dealer in town i couldnt get the time of day from their service managers because i wasnt driving a brand new porsche
art from danny was very honest with me and said there was a good chance i had permanent damage to my car
wow this place was hopping busy when we came in to test drive a few used minis
i recommend this garage and will definitely be back
they called before and showed up at my home on time
being young and really having no established credit was making it pretty much impossible for me to buy a car of any sorts
used to be great and friendly place
they recently offered a free seminar for solar the service guy did an outstanding job
thank you roy for being a breath of fresh air
i am so satisfied
my car was clean inside and out
josh was responsive to all my emails inquiries and millions of questions
i contacted just brakes corporate about the scam this location is trying to pull but of course i never received any contact
my only regret is not walking out
their website says you can call a number if you believe the ticket is unfair and if you were issued the ticket for a very limited number of reasons
if i did id have to go inside instead of the booth thats right next to the cars  not sure what thats about
one time i came with my car and i had a chapstick that melted in my middle counsel and some papers and change was all stuck in it
the other reason why i was reluctant to write one was coz i felt it would be an unfair writeup after only trying mostly their northern thai dishes
absolutely delicious thai for an extremely reasonable price
ive been coming to these guys for years
loved this place
of course my rims are too severely bent to be fixed
they dont answer their phone you cant leave a message and they dont respond to emails
they have several pumps good parking and lots of goodies inside
i called again requesting an estimate and the person i spoke with said she was still putting the estimate together and she would email me or call me with it
we cannot say enough good things about them
two thumbs up and five stars
i chose the compact as i had been shopping price anyway
very happy with discount tire my only complaint might be that their installationdisposal fees etc are a tad bit higher than say costco
he tried talking over my head rather than working with me which was disrespectful
i showed up and everyone denied having ever known a man named lyle who was supposedly the used car sales manager at the time
hes really honest and will only recommend what you need
over exceeding my expectations
i pull over and a hose is hanging off the engine
they charged me 4499  tax for diagnostics which i was okay with the thing that really to me is after an hour they called back claiming they need 2 hours worth of labor to pinpoint which wire it is estimate of 302
gave recommendations but no hassle at all
amber thompson nuff said
i find the staff on the dry line does a much better job of drying my cars and paying more attention to the small details
no more free snacks
i would give this place 10 stars if possible
i did like getting the email receipt  being able to add it there
i was able to run to the gym and a couple of errands and in no time my car was done
he was so amazing and made a completely stressful situation so much better
never again will i purchase a car from them and i warn others so as not to go through what i did
arent they supposed to disconnect the battery when doing maintenance on the air bag system
he tries to explain everything and you can immediately tell how trustworthy he is
i attempted contacting gm scott gruell who would not even return a phone call but promptly handed me to service manager john dunlap
i was very happy with the service they provided
they will help you stay on the road safely and are quick to help you in any way possible
about a week later i needed to get the vehicles glass repaired same day since my husbands car was in the shop
donald tells me i can go get my own smog and they will reimburse me well after wasting my time i get the smog go back to the registry to have to wait another 3hr and 20minso between the registry twice getting the smog test  and calling cartwright motors i have wasted over 6hrs of my time
chris esquire in service is absolutely the top man there
the gentleman i spoke to said they dont reccommend tinting ttops because excessive heat build up can cause the glass to explode but they could do it
what do these fatcats look like you ask
i would highly recommend his shop to anyone looking for a good experience and wanting to save some money compared to what the dealerships will charge you
so i have been putting it off for weeks because i usually get my car serviced at audi henderson
this is our extra car that we dont need to use all the time
i checked the service a description and a fluid check and top up is included
thought  id  give them a try for my smog check
bumping elbows with clans of teens checking their facebook writing emails playing games
its relatively new
then i noticed that it was leaking coolant from a hose they duckt tapped instead of replaced and the ac stopped working after only 2 weeks and when i took it back to show them they said sorry nothing we can do if i could give them negative stars i would i strongly urge anyone whos buying a vehicle to stay far away from this ghetto dealership
walked in and they were able to help right away
some of them are safety issues so i give the okay to fix only those
but jason fixed it so good now im stuck with her for another few more months because its running like new again
if i was looking for a kia i wouldnt go any further than here
we had an signed agreement
they wanted  31000 to fix the egr valve cost for part 6899 and my son in law put it in in 10 minutes
but a big thank you to curtis for making it right
you are buying the least reliable cars in the industry and will become part of their quality assurance person
me although the car i got would have been consider midsize with other companies i have rented with and i explained to him that we were on time but had been standing in line for over forty minutes
i guess the staff would be friendly as theyre cleaning out your bank account
i said go ahead let me know when its ready
i have referred others to him and they have had the same experience
hopefully i wont have to come for repairs againmy tech was jose
he could have easily charged us 600 and i wouldve believed him
it is off the strip so you definitely need to take an ubercab or drive
the employees are friendly fair and extremely honest
im happy i gave it a shot
i took my car in to get it looked at and they told me what it would cost so i left because i wanted a second opinion
if you want them to fix something that isnt broken my power steering pump was noisy but completely functional you have to push a little bit
at times i literally forgot the car wasnt mine
i highly recommend checking this place out and seeing what they have to offer
then he wouldnt give me the price and told me they did not have the car i was looking for but would sell me something else not what i wanted  then the next day brian called me and i let him know that my other half would not allow me to buy a car as we are trying to get out of debt not get more and he said and i quote no problem sweety i understand
when i came in to pick up the toy hauler they took good care of us even though i was 2 hours late getting into town on the busiest rental day of the year two days before thanksgiving
two years ago they replaced my radiator
first they promised a referral of 200 for sending someone over there to buy a car
to be fair the remainder of the checkout process was smooth although i had to wait 10 more mins and do a vehicle inspection with a stranger that rented a different model rv which was odd
i thought it was strange that there was a huge massage chair in the waiting area as well
i wont even get into my main issue of them a overcharging on a used bike with 700 miles i probably could have got a new one for same price or b the fact they charge a crazy setup fee on a bike that arrives almost completely assembled in a crate 400 to put mirrors on
finding an honest mechanic is so nice
this place looks like a shady dealership and chop shop put together
and was also told my car needed 3500 of work took it to my old mechanic in tucson and he did the job for 1200
they dont stop
i think pop a lock is one of their providers and dispatched them
i scheduled the appointment for 10 am on a friday
were just trying to give you money for a car and choosing you over someone else should be a motivating factor for decent customer service
i had 96 minutes wait time
welcome to costco
not bad if you do the month long contract
ill be back
you dont talk to customers in the tone he did and lie to them
he still goes above and beyond to make it happen for me for nothing in return
michelle wright was great
this was my first experience at the pit stop
will never buy from them again
i got a referral from a friend and got both converters changed for 41700   very quick service thanks guys
he also doesnt push you to get extra things that are needed but not necessary ie
pressing a little further they were able to contact these former employees and confirm the deal we had verbally made
one thing i really like is that they always pick up the phone
so not only was this guy a thief and a liar but he was a creep too
susan communicated all changes with me and they cheerfully set me up with a rental car
ive found other mechanics that dont charge for diagnostics especially for such a simple fix
the owner brought it out himself and he did not try to upsell me but instead told me my options for an upgraded battery which was very helpful information
my husband recommended that i try a place his family has been going to for years desert car care
mitch was greatac compressor went out at 91k miles in the dead of summer which is an issue in az
the third time what should have been the final time they ordered the wrong radio
i would highly recommend them to anyone who needs any car repair
although theirs was very good it was nothing like i expected and not what i wanted
i will refer many others to you guys
i figured they were only doing an inspection on my car
hes a wonderful person
they said there can only be one groupon per household and even when he explained that he got one for me as a gift and that we are only dating and do not live together they still would only schedule his truck
showcase honda are scam artist they commit fraud by yoyo financing i signed my contract and drove away with my car they call weeks later asking for documents i already gave them i ask about the previous paperwork they say we dont know weeks later they call back to have us sign another contract with lower monthly pymt we walk away happy weeks later we get a call the loan was revoked and we have to come in and sign an other contract with a higher monthly payment
we asked for a map of central ca and she said they didnt have any
went to big o tires next door with a coupon and was told they didnt have any oil
just 15 of what i was charged for at the dealership with a misdiagnosis
bryan and raymond in the service department was always nice all round great experience they will be seeing my business here from now on and i will me recommending all my friends and family to buy cars from them or to use their service department
i was greeted immediately and my car checked out within a few minutes
always a pleasure to visit this team
will go back here for car help
i got a flat tire today and my husband took it in
the first dealership said they had the car but when we got there  the car was moved to another dealerships
and horrible customer service skills
i went to autonation to purchase a used car i saw on a website
when i am in the phoenix area nobody but juan will be doing the work on my rv
hier hat man sich nicht nur auf dem verkauf von kraftstoffen spezialisiert sondern lebt auch vom verkauf im shop
i pointed this out to the detailer and his solution was to wipe the dirt with a dry rag
i came back to get my second cars windshield replaces a few months later and they remembered my kids and got the same movie ready for them
this big o tires especially alex is the only place thats done any repairs on my truck
i liked the cheap 52 oz
that is the least you can say about them
im still friends with some of those people today
getting a birthday card in 2016 was upsetting
lame i paid 8000 for an oil change and upgraded to the vip car wash for 700
this location is often packed despite other gas stations being on 2 of the other 3 corners at this intersection and they all have around the same pricing
scott was very helpful with my trade in and transition to my new car
doug notter was great
my understanding is this is a pretty typical time frame for collision repair
my daughters car started having issues on a saturday morning
they said oh
for some reason this location offers a lot of freebies
i arrived here at 1052am and they told me there are 13 cars ahead of me  itll take 3hours
if he told me before hand that would be more acceptable
i emailed other dealerships that i was interested in a new prius but lawrence at auto nation was the only one to answer all my questions and even give me prices
when i was driving home i noticed the bottom inside of my windshield had been completely missed and the windows were still pretty spotty
took my car immediately to the dealership and was told 1 of 2 things happened  either gruelichs did not replace the skid plate properly after the oil change so it came loose and fell off or gruelichs did not really even do the oil change at all because they are lying when they say they did not have to remove the skid plate to do the oil change
what a complete waste of my time places like these are what give car salesman a bad reputation
great service
inside door and console of car
i noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome
made me feel like a regular customer right from the beginning
just got my car tinted there the other day and i tell you that these guys are the best
about six months ago my dad told me i needed to have my wheels aligned
unfortunately i no longer trust this dealer and will not be taking my car back
he then explained that hertz charges 14 for gas to drivers who dont provide a fuel receipt
so far so good
dont take your car to them
he only charged me ten bucks
update on 05052016 for the misconduct of sams club employee explained above and poor customer service store manager theresa comped my total purchase worth 100 and also gave me a 25 gift card
ive been here a few times and have always gotten a good car wash the folks who work here will answer when appropriate with fabulous and yet it never feels forced
i was interested in a car and communicated with shannon donohue about the car via email
the very pleasant woman behind the counter told me that it was no problem
i still have the same cupholder problem i dont know how to fix it aside from not having open containers other then water
with that in mind it is very good
dont ever take your car there
love the clean freak by me44th and mcdowell but the employees at this location are hit and miss
their service both with cars and with clients personally is professional and reputable
i called this aamco and the guy said that they usually only do transmission work on the weekend so their mechanicsgeneral tech guys arent in
a girl walks into a mechanic shop looking to get her oil changed while she goes across the street to yoga
stay far away from this dealership
he said he couldnt order it from them because he had to order a used part which only came from junkyards and they had limited availability so i would just have to wait more time
thanks again big man
he said the work would cost about 500 and take around 3 hrs
so both my boyfriend and i took our cars there
you can find them on ebay for just 120 total price
first problem was a dead battery with my nissan
i called tim at 8am and asked if there was anyway he could have it ready by 10 instead of noon
the staff was nice the service was fast and cheap and my zilla is still the king of the hill
i went to oreilys auto parts hoping i could purchase a few bolts and and repair it myself before i headed back to california
yeah right i reported this company and its unprofessional behavior to my insurance company
how much better could that be
you cant go wrong with mike
all the employees are not motivated most hate their job some even said so when asked and they seem to find joy it causing havoc in your life
thank you for the help as i was a pain
i arrive to see the car advertised and mr watson advises me that that car has just been sold
i purchased vehicle may 3 2016 and here it is june 20th and still have not been refunded taxes and licensing and registration monies that were figured into loan at my ridiculously high financing rate
hes so friendly and always makes me feel welcome and not pressured
not only did i blow up their phones with questions but also emailed and the response time was remarkable
the manager corrected the situation with their promised 5 coupon for not having the item within 5 minutes and spoke with the employee
here is what happened to my car i had a 2000 chevy blazer
do not use this location at any cost
we waited two hrs for it to be finished
liked that car a lot
you can put them damn things in the freezer and bake them the next day to the same yummy goodness
i did also get the 5 year100k miles warranty
about the best you can do these days for a diesel truck
jimmy is a solid reliable and honest mechanic
both edward  hal are extremely courteous  very eager to ensure the high quality of work it truly shows
communication issues and long wait aside the truck is fixed and running fine and i was happy that the overall cost was significantly less than what i was originally quoted elsewhere
although there were several open slots and plenty of folks standing around
sorry for being so technical but im only trying to be fair
affordable clean and convenient
if youre reading this review and work at sands get out now
i unfortunately received a small dent with holes in my rear bumper the next week from another car without my knowledge until it was too late to get their information
i wanted to know where my car would be taken after an accident and what the normal procedure was
however they did indicate that they are the number one lexus dealership in arizona and because of their high sales volume they rarely loose a sale to due price
they also didnt remove the writing on my window all the way and my windshield looks like they sprayed stuff on it and did not wipe it off
they forgot to wash the black dirt from my rims
i usually never write reviews but they are great
after pumping my own gas i swear i was waiting around for about 10 minutes while the one guy working was done with another customer talking his ear off
tmk charged me 85 to fix the issue and saved me over 1100
we saw the most gorgeous land rover and were able to get a fine deal for this great car
my alternator went out and needed to be replaced
they perform a very high quality and cost effective service
first of all we went in initially after calling about a truck they had online which they said they still had and then when we got there they said they had sold the truck hours earlier
i envisioned my husband and i in this motor home looking at everything including the outside
so how long does an oil change take
i will be bringing all my future business to you
they checked what was necessary in my car
no computers and its dead on every time
give me a break
in the end i highly recommend buying from them
i just recently had three gates installed custommade powder coated excellent job needed a little touch up great follow through very happy the guys were very responsive and communicated well throughout the process my neighbors think they look great
oil change every 15000km as opposed to most vehicles i believe need it every 5 or 6000km
the installer sorry i didnt catch your name also greased up the rails to allow the regulator to slide easier
had a wonderful experience today with alin my new car guy
i told him that he wasnt allowed to talk to me like that and it became a yelling match
i gave him a tip on his beautiful gazebo outside and mentioned the horrible experience i had upon entering
completely uncalled for
they went above and beyond to make sure i was content
brian one of the new coowners could not have been nicer and more polite both on the phone and in person
not to mention the constant music blasting car alarms going off and employees yelling across lot using vulgar language
i was very impressed
not at all trying to come up on the fact that i have no idea about car repair which is what we are all afraid of
a few days later i received a call that the wrong sales tax had been applied and i would need to sign new paperwork which would in effect cause my payment to increase slightly
and got my car back with a key chain broken off the keys
i waited for 20 minutes and no one showed
i had just gone through a divorce and needed to buy a car pretty much immediately
they have all my information if they really wanted to make the situation better they would have contacted me
after speaking to the person at the corporate office i told him that i was going to post my experience on fb and he said now you are going to extort me
i cant even believe that its mine
i will use him again
after my meeting i notice i have 2 phone calls and a voice mail its mark and he needs me to call him asap thats nice finally now they have had my truck for 6 hours and it needs some attention i call mark and was told that nothing had been done and if i could leave my truck there over night
i was always grateful for a cashier that was just indifferent towards me rather than openly hostile
returned it but never told me what they fixed
i brought my car in on a monday and got it back on thursday
these dudes are cool
i came in for an oil change and possible brakes i believe the manager eric was an extremely helpful guy
he was not pushy at all and very personable
car was in bad shape
there they played the shell game of well mark up your trade in and raise the vehicle price and vice versa never giving a straight answer until we demanded a final number on the third visit in as many days and then they were way off and never did give us the trade in value amount of our cars
i cant remember the name of the male that was helping me but i am not ratting anyone out just yet
he and the other guys that work there are so friendly and knowledgable
i came in for a usual maintenance service and left with more problems than i came in with
turned out it had a unspecific odor inside the car
she explains every detail and answers all questions you have
the financial bit takes a loooong time
i asked what for i only drove 18 miles
i will definitely be using them for all my service and repairs
i appreciate how fast frank mooradian helped me complete my finance paperwork
fyi if you are in a rush definitely go between 7am to 9am weekdays
excellent customer service
he did what he was supposed to do build rapport sell us on the carblah blah blah
we like it so much we went to his vamps
how can you tell me theres an issue with my account if my credit card company says there isnt
if you have been to eitheryou know what im talking about
nothing additional was performedjust slow service
on a lot of the parts they made no profit and i simply paid what it cost them
allan took really great care of me with rental and all
while filling out the clip board with my information which i already thought was odd since i know i am in their system i noticed the pricing
we just had them cater our last party
i have been highly disappointed with this car wash
they fixed the car fast and it works like a charm
very fair pricing
as usual no wait car was clean and leaving the lot was quick
i couldnt be happier with the recent purchase of my fully loaded mythos black 2017 a4 quattro sport line an amazing car
tim did a great job for 180
excellent customer service
dawn is always so helpful and accommodating when i take my mini in for its check ups all the staff are friendly and do a top notch job
what a bad experience
i insisted they bring me my vehicle immediately  had they started the work on time they would have found this issue early enough for me to make arrangements to find care for my mom in kingman for the night
there is now in fact a half inch crack near the 5 injector of my diesel fuel rail
i then left infuriated and spent the next few hours trying to figure out how i could get a duplicate faxed but had no luck
i understood that my hub bearing was not in warranty but they could of atleast of checked it out without all the extra fees they wanted to add
they work pretty quickly so you only have to sit outside for 10 or so minutes
got a call from an unknown female from protech and proceeded to get yelled at
i had an appointment at 10 am and i got there at 10 am and they were ready to start on my vehicle
i looked at another car and told them i could pay everything but 2000 and they expressed that they only financed 4000 or more
he told me the green slime was not good for my tire sensors
furthermore the gas tank was empty
i was a little surprised
he struck me as honest and just looking to provide a great service at a fair cost
do not rent from them
they never even offered a test drive
drove my car in from florida and it is a mess
i am surprised in this day  age with the cost of fuel 4 gallon that he was still fair with me
couldnt do as promised on buffing out paint deoxidization
i found it odd that it would take 2 hrs to pop out 2 studs and replace them
and that hope is found in larchmere imports
the work was done in a very timely manner
the crew came out next day and had my windshield done within 30 minutes
well today i picked up my shell and noticed they also installed new struts for no additional charge
i am very particular about my car and once i find a trustworthy place i stick with them  so glad to have found that here
the sales associate told me over the phone that of course we will match it im not gonna lose a sale for 400
the only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is i thought that the installation price should have been a little bit cheaper
they lie to your face
i did a test drive on my own and came back with my husband to do the deal a couple days later  and im lucky i did
in the endits a gas station
there are plenty of other mechanics in this town and i will never give my business to this one
car selection minimal
to answer your question we the people there at the dealership to look at your inventory to see if you have a vehicle that matches our needs
i would recommend this place to anyone
the young man who greeted me was heinously unprofessional
this is where audi of peoria proceeded to take a fantastic sales tool that could have brought in repeat customers and instead used it to drive customers away with incompetent execution
the car wash is average at best
the agreed upon amount was paid for in full and papers were signed and was told any repairs that needed to be done would be done per state law
then i noticed my oil was leaking
out within 35 minutes
they are also not open during weekends
to the guy who did my cardidnt have enough cash on hand and the 5 i gave wasnt enough for your hard work so ill be back soon to pay it forward homie
have been using them for 15 years and have never felt ripped off or suspicious of anything they have said we needed
we were told that this would be consistent with not wanting to disturb the fluid in the internal areas such as the torque converter in order to prevent any particles from further damage to the valvessolenoids
displeased with my visit today
it turns out i was the first customer at their new location at bell rd and the 17 check them out
i think their charges are very reasonable for the level of service expertise that they provide
the lines maybe long but it is worth it
if i could give this shop no star i would i feel so disrespected
i did not purchase my vehicle from here but definitely will
i expect to be able to pull in gas up and pull out
okay car wash a little pricey for just the wash convenient if in a hurry
my discussion with the event owner this morning was nothing more than a complete embarrassment that the organizer of this event is coming to me with his hand out
im giving one star for the car wash and the car wash service person and 4 star to al escalona at the way he handled the customer complain
they had an old international scout in the driveway waiting to be restored so they obviously love cars
the place was crowded and is pretty good size  the whole time we were there
like fox newswe reportyou decide
a little out of my way considering i live near aliante but definitely worth the drive
this is a game changer
illinformed inexperienced sales staff
later that night my car stopped in traffic
they even worked with the dealer in california that i bought the car from for payment
when we arrived they informed us that we would not be hydroflighting today because there was too much debris in the water
we were charged for cancellation fee which we did not cancel but the driver did
to start the line up is always long and the service is slow
i had the dealer try to charge me 1200 for a new computer system in my car i brought it to this place and he was able to troubleshoot the problem to a loose wire
many dealers wont tell you the price until you sit down to buy and then additional charges are added like pdi and other charges
we were passing through las vegas on our way home after purchasing a new 5th wheel
no haggling which changes the way the sales people work
first impression was great
i am so happy i finally found a real hyundai dealer
i have yet to have anything but excellent service at this location
bought my 2011 camaro brand new  great experience  even drove the long way from gilbert for service etctwice a year
lulu and robert where excellent in his help to me and buying my jeep was an excellent experience
they have an express wash setup you get exterior washes for a month for about 1500 i buy it once a month now in and out in maybe five minutesi get about 8 washes a month with it two bucks each
and that aint no bull
i received a call 4 hours later telling me what it was and then when i asked if my extended warranty covered it i was told they were closed
everything we loved about our first year or so was amplified by dawns level of interaction with us attention to detail proactivity honestythe list could go on
we have 4 people total
this was definitely the best newcar buying experience i have ever had
i understand theyre busy but as we speak ive been sitting in the waiting area for 1 hour 15 minutes and my car hasnt movedthey havent even started on it yet
i was not feeling good about the situation at this point and had an overwhelming sense that i was not being taken seriously or treated fairly by the men in this office
but it was a screw in the tire
i did not even complete the process because i was asked to provide my ssn and i did not wish to provide it
on the machine it says add whipped topping to your favorite frozen or hot drink
much better than the dmv
i ask anthony when should i pick it up he states 3 and i say how about 4 to give you adequate time because i am going to see transformers anyways he replies with i will have it ready then
i found break masters on yelp
prices are not exactly cheap but more or less the same as other nondealer mercedes shops
i had shopped around at 3 other dealers and nobody wanted to come down on the price but this dealership would
the gentleman said he would get his manager
i said no and he said that the guy across from us would help me
dont waste your time coming here to this location is stood in front of geek squad for a good ten minutes trying to be patient and many of this employees walked by and not even one bother to acknowledge me  so i  left
overall she had a very rude attitude
hes there to fix your car and thats exactly what hell do
this place is amazing
john in service said it would be 3 hours but offered a shuttle service
why is it so hard to get a good car wash in vegas
got a good deal from this dealership they destroyed findlay vws price no bs straight to the dealing
i again call them to find out what is taking so long and i am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company
i was expecting a long wait due to it being a saturday but i wasnt there for longer than 20 minutes
why does it take a lawsuit to get the most fundamental level of customer service anymore
the service from the second we rolled down the window was pleasant and honest
there are plenty of auto parts stores
outstanding customer service and top quality workmanship
each rental company has its own space
the guy said i need new struts after only looking at the drivers side wheel well
hes a lousy salesmen and pathetic person in general
if i could give it a zero i would have
i usually judge a thai place based on their pad thai and this place had pretty good pad thai
the charges were for one day of rental no problem 24 in late fees because it was returned one hour later than i picked it up alright ill take the fault for that an upgrade fee fine and 54 in insurance not requested whatsoever
very prompt professional service
great customer service and excellent job
i was so excited to drive home because the tint not only made the outside of my car look great but the inside look and feel amazing too
all the parking is covered in there is always a bus shuttle right there ready to take you to the airport
he said can you please write your offer down and sign it
when we spoke to the manager he did not care and just told us oh well sorry
had previous loans and banked here for years
we had been there 4 hours and i was exhausted and didnt catch price change
time to time this car wash place is closed at 545pm
i have never gone in for an oil change and had them not recommend at least 3 other things
they practically accused me of removing the muffler from a car that wasnt originally equipped with one
very honest old fashioned service
the prices we found were just right for what we were looking for
i would recommend ben mynatt without hesitation
i purchase my honda accord here brand new thats why i regularly bring my car for maintenance like oil change
after multiple visits for different reasons we know we can trust scott and his team
over all just the worst experience
when i was talking to joe he wanted to take a look at the warranty and sure enough he discovered that it was under warranty
im writing this review in the shop right now
which i didnt get because i was looking for a 2008 or 2009 cayenne turbo
we highly recommend their service
recently purchased a set of firestone tires from an authorized dealer in co
he was consistently professional attentive and actually listened to what we needed in a vehicle throughout the process
i brought the vehicle and part to another shop to have this installed when they informed me that there was no rodent damage anywhere and all i needed was a temp sensor due to the original one being faulty
we took our car on a good test drive on and off the highway
they you go in and wait and can see your car being hosed down on tv screens which is a nice feature which creates a certain sense of professionalism
however if you read this and it changes your mind or even adds a shadow of a doubt then i am thankful that you will potentially not have to endure the poor attitudes and lousy service that i experienced
thanks guys for all of your help
lots of good coupons
very pleased with the service
my entire career has been in automotive
went here for gas regretfully on a few occasions as it is in a convenient location
it saddens me to have to give a sheetz a one star review
at no point in time did i feel like he was attempting to up sell
bridwell helped us in a timely and professional manner
nothing but terrible experiences with their service department
of course they informed me of the crack the day before it was finally ready for pick up and they didnt admit they cracked it
i feel comfortable coming to hondoctors for problems i run into with my vehicle as well as with routine maintenance
personally i always prefer to go to independent garages that focus on certain brands as opposed to dealerships
however according to andrew g my vin number did not match a recall and not acknowledged
ill take quality every time
the service department here is totally incompetent and could care less about you or your vehicle
had people stopping to take our pictures like we were celebrities
though you may have to push a bit to get them to honor that pledge
maybe those people have cut rate insurance you get what you pay for people
so if you get these dishes expect to spend about 50
he said he didnt feel right leaving me alone in the parking lot at night wo a definite ride home and oked it w his office to drop me off
even when i called and i didnt have the last name of someone i was trying to reach she gave me attitude and then we were disconnected
when he saw my mini cooper he immediately said i was lucky to have the base model as he recently saw multiple incidents that transmission went wrong with the s models of the same production generation which costs like 8k
you see jose continued to ask more probing questions about me and not share his knowledge about the car we were driving except for when i asked how much is the car
there was no high pressure or hassles in negotiating the sale or trading in my previous vehicle
the customer service that they have at this location is absolutely amazing
every now and then is one thing
we could see that these things would be extra but 11 months is crazy
i wont ever take my car anywhere else
while waiting for the repairs to be completed i sat in the waiting area with a couple other customers
they were very clear with what they found and extremely straight forward and honest
i started asking the manager questions
the price is definitely better then most in town
monday afternoon i get a call from barry he wants to make an appointment  i can not commit to a time due to my job so tell him sometime between 630p  800p  tuesday i go in and guess what  no the deal is not done  but hey i can test drive the other cars  hey isnt that what you are supposed to do before you try financing  dont you test drive first
avoid at all costs
i highly recommend hollywood auto service
me and my brother went in looking to purchase a vehicle salesman refused to let us test drive a used vehicle and wanted a commitment to purchase before allowing a test
it does get busy sometimes
what a pleasant surprise
unless theres another deal i probably wont be back
if you are not careful they will lose you and your place in line
i cant say enough good things about scot
needless to say we left and went straight to tempe honda and purchased the vehicle
i was really nervous because i had a bad experience with a different shop a few years ago
however right before we were about to sign the papers a sales manager came over and informed me that there was already a deposit on the car i was looking at but that they could very likely get me the same car by monday at the agreed upon terms
pretty much like all the other reviewers sayits convenient its cheap and the people are really nice
it isquite entertaining to watchemployees are super nice and courteous didnt stare and i was greeted by the owner nickhe was so nice and explained everything to me about why they are different
well we had a very similar experience here
too bad the cars computer wasnt that smart
she did and then called me an hour later and did a 3 way with my insurance
have had work done here on our two cars and am extremely happy with the speed  quality of service i received
i am really not the complainer type of guy but i gotta say dont waste your hard earned dollar on this rip you off type of establishment
he came to my house at 750am for an 8am appointment
i stopped in here to cash in a lottery ticket and pick up a pack of cigarettes yes i know that makes me sound white trash but i swear thats what i came in here for
when we finally took him to the car to show him we were indeed telling the truth he told us that the eco setting which was a huge selling point for us for the car basically cant be used in the summer in az because it means the ac will not work
toyota made everything super easy to understand made my experience amazing
well the mechanic bob must have literally taken less than a minute to fix it
probably the best example of the above and beyond customer service was the fact that our 03 vehicle had a leak in the rear light bar that caused it to no longer work water does that with electronics
well be coming back with all our other stationary needs
looked like lemon in a small package similar to a ketchup package
otherwise the minimum option would be the 681hr option and heaven forbid that i would let my audi get that dirty
i do not recommend their service department at all
ive regretted the decision to not have the team at hm check it out first
i had bad credit and theyve treated me as if i had the best credit in the world
now this is where i really appreciate jeremy
scheduling is easy the waiting area is beautiful with free popcorn  wifi and they always offer to wash my car for free
i took my wife to station square for the evening to have dinner
ive never pumped gas or got a car wash here so i cant comment on that
i will never go to another body shop
the guy behind the counter named duff says well didnt stan tell you yesterday that it could be as high as 900
i wish they could just look up my warranty info and say yes thats covered or no its not based on the information i give them
9 months after my rebuild my trany completely went out while out on a sunday afternoon
also i was told that todays oil change was my 3rd time having an oil change done
so i would definitely recommend this place if you are on the run
it was our first visit
they did quality work on my car and the customer service is fantastic
with my needs of having a wheel bearing and strut replaced they had my vehicle in and out within 1 hour
and they clearly never try to rip you off
he never called back
we used the service for the memorial weekend
this place is located off the strip and in a plaza with lots of other asian foods
my first impression and experience with al and rony is nothing but stellar customer service
it was close to 120 degrees at the time
honest friendly and the prices are reasonable
very professional and attention to detail
most shops would have created a problem  you have this or that  not blaine he checked over the vehicle and a little grease later he called and told me to come pick up my vehicle and for a couple of bucks and keys in hand i was out the door
oscar our service manager rocks
i would definitely without a doubt order this again
and i was going with my own financing bc i like to stick with usaa i think usually dealerships are put off by that but they really didnt care
therefore i put 5000 down on my credit card to hold the car i purchased a one way airline ticket to vegas paid for a hotel room i committed to purchasing the car
i was getting new pads and rotors on my vw and dropped my car off in the morning on a saturday
great customer service from nick and arthur
ill definitely go back for my next oil change
so the guy gives us the keys and sends us on our merry way
hmmmm doesnt seem right now does it
when we arrived at the dealership we were met by a friendly salesman ken
i had a completely opposite experience with clark and the repair shop than other users
so we just rode around the area and didnt get on the highway as they were doing construction on 480 and we didnt want to run out of gas in traffic
when he came to pick it up they had it wrapped up for him in their delivery bay and the whole team cheered him on as they unveiled his new toy
pascal even provided me with a loaner and dropped off my car to me when it was ready
100 stars would be givin if possible
i called 23 24 hour towing companies and none of them answered their phone
he loves that food and chomps it upand if you havent tried the mickey mouse chicken nuggets in the frozen sectionyou are missing out big timethe seafood ravioli is great and we also got the smoked pulled bbq pork pre cookedheats up great in the microwave and their bbq sauce2 huge jugs for like 800 is very tasty too
the work was well done and gates coordination with my insurance company was great
will not recommend not even to my worst enemy
the person who helped me was very kind and friendly considering what she has to deal with every day
i drove down here from the far north after being told by centennial toyota that my 30000 was not wanted  the worst of the worst at centennial toyota
my can is just over 39000 miles so my warranty no longer covered this issue
i wish i could give this place no stars but if i must to get my freaking point across
very good experience on a saturday afternoon
the customer service was excellent but the product did not meet the standards set
3 mileage is on original engine not rebuild
superstition honda had beat there price on a exl with navi by 1000 per month
great customer service
he told me id be entered into a drawing to win 100 when i completed the service
my experience was much like the others
i thought that was strange since i just took it to a sears in phoenix a few weeks before and they found nothing wrong with it
we loved it
the way i see it there are only two possible reasons for this freak timing of car failures right after i had a vehicle inspection from firestone
im no longer going to go to this dealership ever again and will try to work with desert 215 instead
i had him send over the paperwork i signed them and sent them right back
i would not recommend them for towing repairs or anything else
thank you carl and mechanic
i worked with ryan jenny in sales and jamie steinseifer one of the sales managers
very friendly staff
he worked quickly and efficiently and was beyond kind and helpful
dale took one look under the hood and told me quite simply that the dealer was likely trying to swindle me
but for normal maintenance plan ahead when scheduling
just bought a new explorer from performance
i would like to get a simple oil change
and only 20
on my friends recommendation i called kens auto repair and told them what the ford dealer recommended
and worst part of all they now want 70 a tire with 12 dollars balancing
i was expecting to pay 2530 for an oil change
i have had a couple of cars tinted here one with 3m crystalline the other with photosync and can say without a doubt that i would never go anywhere else or recommend anyone go anywhere else
the staff are nice but this shop is just another where i will no longer trust my business
very friendly and courteous
anyway i am a technical writer by profession and pride myself in being able to write coherently and concisely free of spelling and grammar errors
needed an alignment
after the deal was made kevin returned over and told me i would not be allowed to drive the car off the lot till i had full coverage insurance
they dont do a monthly subscription but i could get 5 washes a month for the price of a subscription at clean freak so it works for me
i felt pressured to do so and didnt have anyone to turn to for help
alas i am getting service so i guess this is the company i need to file it under
read my review  see i had just flown in from out of state to buy a used older vehicle  picked it up  took it to this location to do fluids  inspection before my 8hour drive back
been living in vegas for over 13 years and have been too a lot of machine shops like perfect auto repair and etc
trying to get a return phone call from the service department or certain members of management is impossible
i was under the impression that everything was taken care of
we even got a fresh battery for the smoke detector
my parents started going to him a long time ago and we havent used anyone since
he really cares years after the money has already changed hands
i came in to replace my old burned out stock head unit
we arrived here on 040917
was not charged anything and was physically shown i had 50 left on my pads
recently called their service department inquiring about reflashing my ecm because i had installed a cool air intake on it and it through a trouble code lean fuel
since we were going out of town we did the car inspection
less than fifteen minutes later they were done and our car was better than new
there were no hassles or extra recommendations to upsell just did what i asked for in a timely manner
may want to be a little more careful
even new parts can fail so it wasnt on them and the quality and speed of work was great
even though we ordered off the menu i think the kitchen struggled to get out of their allyoucaneat mindset
they explained what i needed what could wait and what wasnt as bad as others said it was
i pay 40year to shop between the hours of 108 however the majority of my shopping happens before 10am and after 8pm
by far the lowest price i have ever paid for synthetic
ive been trying to reach you for over two weeks now
here are some pictures of my console areas right after my car wash this past saturday
in that time id always had the pleasure of dealing with don the former owner
i cant remember the name of my salesman he was very nice and helpful
in that case they physically put a server under your table to suck your bouchon
i didnt even spot john until about 420 he informed me that due to the heat some of the rubber components were drying out
the email came after a total of 10 phone calls had been made and 6 messages left 2 with the service advisor 2 with the service manager 1 with the collision center manager and lastly 1 with the general manager
have a true price advertised for your vehicles
would give 0 stars if i could
instead the valve cost me 25 i installed it with jb weld all leaks are gone and oil changes are a breeze now
both times i have dealt with the sales department i been a bit put off by the professionalism of the staff
matt myers worked hard and really took care of me
i shopped several flooring businesses and found the perfect flooring here
never introduced himself at all
fast forward 30 days later
after i went to pick up the car an oil change was done on the vehicle even though i did not order it
heres the amazing partwe get home its 1000pm and i take a look at the financepurchase agreements
john the owner found me the best shop for my windshield repair and provided me with the information i needed to get a hold of them
again tyler and his team on the finish line are in absolutely no hurry to wipe the drying water spots off your car let alone scrub the bugs off the front or even do the windows yep you guys missed all 3 of these which are the only 3 things you have to do
great service  attention to detait expert knowledge
these guys actually drive the car to make sure its right before it goes back to the customer
i offered to pay whatever my sins would cost me
i asked him the price and he came up with a price more than 6000 26000 while others have quoted around 19000 than other dealers
they walked my husband and i through everything that was going on with the car so we were able to have confidence while making our decision with this third party
these guys are all around amazing
so now 5 month as after i purchased my bike along with my warranty i have a issue with my bike and cannot even take it into a shop yet
he introduced himself asked if we needed any help and offered his assistance
unless you want to have your battery tampered with so you can buy a new one to get your car home
the team here came do a agreement on what we both thought was a fair deal
some experiences would warrant 45 stars others not so much
even though ken had said he fully inspected and drove the car
we worked with jason carter and he was the complete opposite of your typical car salesman
i recently brought my kia sorrento in for an oil change
then he checked around and found the someone else had taken it home to see if they wanted to buy it
however dana tire is trustworthy and will give you top expert advice and work with you to find the most affordable option and best value
let me preface this review with the fact that my mother has worked at a hair salon in atlanta for years and i get my hair done by the owner there whos amazing and has been doing hair for 20 years for free whenever i can make it down
another crazy thing is that rich the mechanic called me after i had gotten my car back and asked me for more money
at the hour 30 mark i was getting a bit restless so i asked the status
it was the managers who ruined the experience and i am sure he was the one who got yelled at for not making the sale
wont take my car anywhere else
takes forever though
i had my car towed to a repair shop out here and called autobahn to discuss my situation
they said they didnt find any leaks and in order to do the check correctly they had to put freon in the car and charged me 140 bucks first rip off right there because i never approved anything and told them it didnt have any in the car when i dropped it off
the staff is amazing
also very friendly guys
the process is straight forward   1 drive up
this place is fantastic
i received a black galaxy tab 3 8gb which is a best buy exclusive as a gift from a work party
get the pig  grits with an egg sunny side up
and ken know us on a first name basis
i love this place
this is a place you must try when you go to vegas
went for a smog and was in and out within five minutes
the store is always immaculate and the staff is extremely polite and helpful
they responded very well when you call them
no big deal
thank you for a great experience i will definitely be a returning customer
update i just cant leave it at 5 stars
i also spoke to sales at autozone advance auto parts and orileys for pricing
not going back there again
he is knowledgeable and is able to answer any and all questions
you werent even there
also love my salesperson josue colon who has sold me the last 2 altimas
you could have gotten tickets on craigslist for cheaper than lvms retail price
ive had mixed experiences with spadina auto
at this point i called one of the managers and their reply was that they were now negotiating a new deal to sell it and would call me back once they knew more details
i called them on friday afternoon  230p  i was picked up by 330p
this is not how anyone should ever behave towards a customer in a retail setting
my wife and i went there over the weekend to look at an altima
excellent dealership that prides itself on service and attentiveness
cheaper if you book online
i had to come back monday to get those things fixed no service at lmd on sundays
my car looks awful i have to go and get something to wipe down inside my selfsmh dont waste our money its a complete waste of time its plenty of car washes in nevada just save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else
when i arrived they informed me that they would have to charge me if i didnt already do my own scan and know the error codes so i drove down the street to auto zone really quick to get it retested since i hadnt written them down
unfortunately the experience ive had with more is definitely less
i cant say enough good things about this dealership and the crew they have working here
i totally recommend
corey the front deskco owner assessed my car for free and as it turns out he only recommended a change new gasket with minor welding
i even stepped on the bus to let the bus driver know we are the party with the person in wheelchair
no smiles no how are yous just what do you wanna buy and buy it now
on another occasion no respect for time when you are in the shop wondering whether you should stay or go
i was all prepared to post my displeasure about  buying and selling here but everyone else has the same story
they did a great job vacuuming the vehicle wiped down the vinyl inside removed the trash and cleaned the inside windows
food is really good and to die for but service are not good
however my insurance adjustor had said that the other party involved in the accident will pay for the deductible
thats a record
my shop was closed so i had no choice
im working on getting my 5th from rico this year
i told him how unhappy i was
this would explain the reeking clutch smell when subaru took delivery
update 062013  i have been using go az for bmw issues i cannot resolve  they are an awesome dealer
i never go to a mechanic unless its something i cant do myself or have no time to do it myself
he and frank did their best to negotiate with us to make me happy
expensive and they dont wipe out your console or vacuum well at all
but it is suspicious and this treatment was rediculous
it is a good all around service center and i recommend trying them
if it wasnt for quincy mosley id give this dealership 12 stars
no big dealwe get into the office and here comes the older guy possibly the father even with the quoted estimate in hand  he still quotes us over a grand in repairsjustifying the cost by painting other areas of the car and removing panels that was not damaged or no where near the area of the fender bender
hubby  i took a day to go into phxscottsdale about a month ago it takes an hour to get there so we plan ahead in search of a late model f250 diesel to pull a 5th wheel
i would suggest them to anyone i know
i entered this tomb of doom and gloom for a new id card
so now i shift gears
i wouldnt have started negotiations on the car had i known the real price because i dont mind the fact that it was over my budget
if they recommend a service while on a routine oil change they back it up with proof
however i always am greeted by a friendly smile and great service whenever i stop in to grab a red bull or a pack of a cigarettes
they are trying to get a deal just like you are
definitely goes the extra mile for his customers
just had the best car buying experience with one of the most open and honest professionals ever i left his office with only a few business cards and because of the overall quality experience have already given them all out
took my car in for the scheduled maintenance and to get new tires
i was even told of common problems with my model
when i bought a set of tires for my truck they worked with me on the price and worked in a promotional gift card
her sales manager came to me with some bogus line that he probably tells everyone our goal is to sell 5 cars per day and you would be the potential 5th buyer right
this place treated us awful
chapman dodge chrysler jeep in henderson
the price was honest and below competitors and they even came in below quote
because they cant i took a star off the rating
any sales commission so i will be looking for a different dealership
he is awesome
they also have a great deal on getting my check engine light diagnosed and serviced
i would definitely recommend them and will use them again
a phenomenal company wish all the other companies would follow them as a role model amazing staff well organize very speedy no worlds to describe the quality of service they provide
they can never close up shop because i dont know what i will do
congrats on the new location as well
customer service is nonexistent
justin was amazing
i like qt this one is close to my house i usually like going for a fountain drink or hot dog today i tried qt kitchen for the first time i order some ice cream and shakes they gave me the ice cream really quick the shakes were going to take a while since there wasnt any ice cream they said a few minutes and i was there for a little more than 10 minutes and the girl who was making them was complaining the whole time cause they were close to closing the kitchen so a guy came and help her since she got another 2 orders to do i think it was his first time in the kitchen he made the first shake and on the second one he ran out of oreos and told the girl she got an oreo bucket and slammed it on the counter then she got it and started purring oreos on my shake saying this is how much i care not measuring how many scoops and well my shakes tastes straight up like oreos and no mint flavor and it so dark compared to the first one they made last time i will use this qts kitchen
so remember if you are in las vegas and a place comps you for a meal a cocktail or a naughty pleasure please give a generous tip to show the person underwriting the comp you are classy and appreciative
should have read the reviews before i went
not to mention the best price i had found in the valley
brought my car in and told them what was wrong
my dad said ok youre the expert lets replace it
i will be using them for all of my auto detailing needs
ive never gotten such great service at an auto repair before
not missing huge chunks of the car because youre on tight schedule
i had an appointment with safelite and their tech could not change my windshield because my xterra has a snorkel on it
and a special thanks to them for washing the inside of my windows in addition to the outside
in all we will be buying a new hubcap for our truck paid for 2 over priced oil changes and were offered nothing for our troubles
i just walked out even though i was starving
unless money is no object run dont walk to the next dealer
the price was very competitive and i even got a special rebate and the size was available many of the placed i looked at were out of stock given that it was the start of the winter season
seriouslythis place does a lot
so as i was paying at the cashier the same guy then was behind the cashier and said they couldnt wash my car through the normal wash because of the bike rack on the top of my car
great job guys
my ceo said several days later that he would never be able to order scallops again as they could never top lotus i will simply not go back to las vegas without eating at lotus of siam
thanks a ton eric t
can i fault them for it
i need a valid mode of transportation to get to and from these jobs and have chosen a 2010 dodge journey to do so
i recently brought it in for an oil change and mike and the team took great care of me
so i immediately call uhaul i get the run around from sabrina who is apparently the end all be all of management at uhaul because i asked for her supervisors phone number and she gave me the number to the call center
mehi bought my 3rd hd from shd
i called and got two specific quotes for service and made an appointment for a specific time for the work to be done so that it could be done as quickly as possible
not going back or recommending to anyone
loved loved their duck with drunken noodle i reduced one star because  1 little portion  3 girls had to order 4 dishes and my friends dont even eat much
the food is very authentic and has so much flavor
i drive here rather than going to places closer ie
one thing i really didnt like about this restaurant is that their portions are small
id done extensive amounts of the research multiple spreadsheets over months on used cars and this 325i was the car
i told him no knowing that i would do it myself especially if it was that dirty
honestly i was already having a bad day and the experience from the moment i walked into the door from the genuine interaction with mike to the efficiency thoroughness and follow up from the team was so noticeably different that i would drive out of my way to return to them for any further vehicle needs i have
their gas prices are pretty reasonable
i will never ever ever go back to service king my car got more damaged while it was in their care
great customer service every time
avoid these guys real bad car wash
peoria ford has great service techs that get you in and out in a very timely manner
so glad to have found them
his bosstech dan rigged up a secondary power source to ensure that my radionevigation system would not lose power during battery replacement
the price sent in email was 16804 for the certified used vehicle
we went back a second time the weekend of our visit
they told us we could come back another day and they would clean it so a few weeks later we drove out from east mesa but a machine to clean it wasnt working and even if it had been working it wouldve needed to be left over night
great selection of sauces
best shop on bell rdjerry the manager is awesome always a honest repair from jerry
we mentioned it to the man at the front desk and he immediately called someone to take it back and recheck my car
i got both front tires replaced and will be headed back to do the rear ones soon thanks again matt brandonrobbie  ryan
the must have known they did it because someone fumbled around with the display before i got the car backbut nobody said anything when they turned the car over
i spent about an hour walking around tempe marketplace then went to the waiting room
somebody goofed and i emailed the corporate site requesting a phone call to discuss
some are just aggressive and misleading sales calls while others are complete scams
the people at team ford were super legit  they did make a few jokey remarks about how much id like a new f150 but there was zero pressure
i just hate it when you have to go in and wait in line just to get a receiptunless they had a separate line just to print receipts
they gave a good price
good customer service over the phone and in person no hassles the used tires are serving their purpose
all of the items in the house were to be moved to a storage unit which we hoped would fit everything
i had excellent customer service
they did not ask me what i want to see but rushed me to give them my current car info for tradein value
from now on i will be making the extra drive if possible just to make sure my car goes there
your quick response to my hurt feelings was what made me turned around and kept my business with your company
i stuck my tractor in the mud yesterday my neighbor and i couldnt get it out
we were on vacation and our rear breaks went bad late friday night
mr moussa dalla helped him
dean  jim were very professional
take your car to another place will be a better choice
let me start off by saying i hate car shopping
when we finally had enough we went to pick up our rv for the final time
i called robert back and said ill take it
now i may not know how to flush a transmission or rotate my own tires but as a jeep owner and daughter of a father who has worked in the car business his whole life i know what usually needs to be done to take care of my vehicle without unnecessary spending
the dealership  service area is always clean and efficient
i got this tint done about a week or two ago and i really like how it looks on my car
i understand car dealerships hustle but this is just straight robbed
therefore the next steps are 1 exploration of legal action and 2 potentially filing a police report
ive brought my car in 3 different times for a simple oil change over the past 6 months and every single time theyve turned me away because they either sent their mechanic home early one time i went at 3pm
willl i come back here again
since they only had 5 on staff to finish the rest of the job i was quoted an hour wait to have the car cleaned on the inside
just purchased new wheels and tires and i was very anxious about the outcome my car is brand new
griffin brothers was recommended by my brother for their quality of service and price two things many consumers look for
er nahm sich zeit und erklrte ausfhrlich die auswirkungen der leistungssteigerung auf das fahrzeug die mglichen probleme und auf was in zukunft zu achten ist
this establishment may be good for repairs  but they are way too expensive and will try and up sell you and make you feel like it all needs to be done right away
we had to return this truck to this location and upon our arrival the gentlemen that helped us out mentioned the review i had left and apologized for the mixup
very dishonest and will rip you off
you not only saved me over 10 my car looks better than i would have expected it to look from getting it cleaned at your establishment
new owners have greatly reduced staff and you can tell how slow things are now
plus there is youtube
the shop owner informed me that my entire ac compressor was busted and needed a complete replacement including a flush of the ac system and the accumulator
if you have problems with other parts stores try the 35th  cactus pep boys
they ordered it friday today is monday super fast
apparently it was a different problem but jeff said he would do the new repair for free and lent me his car so i could drive my 6 month old daughter home to be fed
i wanted something that was used and older i was shown 3 trucks in the bullpen that were over 100000 miles each with flat tires and key scratches all up the drivers side
i know why they want you to buy parts from them so they can charge more
brought my car in at 8am when they openedfront desk person was in the bathroom for 5 minuteswhen they finally came out they looked at me but then turned and poured themselves a glass of water before acknowledging me
i did not receive this list and was not told a check like this was done
so i went back and brought the general manager to point out the guy and he had disappeared
after waiting over and hour for this ridiculously easy repair i was given a discount by the manager of 20 because i was a fellow jetta owner this is after he showed me his really expensive jetta logo sunglasses he got for 200
the store was clean but again busy
i walked over to where my car was and a super star employee told me a guy hit his breaks in front of my car and if there was damage to take it up with him and walked away
our car was easy to find clean new and nice
whiteys auto repair is the place for my little honda
i pulled into a discount tire only to be told all of your tires had different psi levels
which lead me to a rebate page which my tires qualified for buy four michelin tires and receive a 70 rebate
we leave avondale toyota and go see danny
let me tell you  why i went everywhere in town including out of town near los angeles to get a quote just to wrap my spoiler
got my car back the same day brake issue still present got home found they forgot to give me my insurance card back called and they said the mechanic forgot to put it back so the same day about a hour after i picked up my car noticed that the engine started ticking open the hood and oil is everywhere the mechanic never put the oil cap on and oil was coming out
we are selling our vehicle and it needed to be detailed
okay that isnt too bad
i was not pleased with my experience at this location what so ever
no explanation except that i should be happy they were taking the time to repair it properly
as of today i wont be returning
finally i went somewhere else 10 days ago
overall one of the most frustrating time consuming underwhelming car buying experiences ive had
3 stars  not that good but not that bad
gave me 7 off for being a new customer
thank you sooooo much joseph
my husband and i are here on vacation from new jersey
i has a bluetooth mic new stereo and speakers put in
i called 21517 to get an estimate on 2 new tires and the friendly guy on the phone told me it would be around 120 before tax and warranties
the service center is an absolute nightmare
truly a stressfree experience
when the manager brought me out to see the car she introduced me to the guy who worked on it
jalapeo sausage  fantastic
they do a decent job compared to other car washes around the valley
you have 3 manual transmission new compasses in route and 1 on your lot
of course i had my husbands guidance but for the most part i made the calls asked the questions etc
never again  i wasnt even the one renting
discount tire rotates and balances my tires every 6k miles free since i purchased my tires with from
thank you joe for making our stay a most enjoyable one
i never bought a car before in which i was not given a walk through
i could have used a limousine service for 200 lyft does not help recover your money
we had a great experience at iautohaus
i only gave 4 stars because it is my first time using them and it was for something rather minor
it would require dropping the pan which would waste a lot of transmission fluid
i just want to say the green valley car wash is going downhill
other things such as no water in the windshield wiper well and a  missing washer in the water hose were typical of their service
ordered chicken tenders and fries compared to the other foods this was pricier
yup thats right 600 out the door
if you dont think honesty integrity with reasonable pricing applies to most auto repair businesses then you need to go to ajs auto service
he gave us the time to arrive
choosing this carmax was one of the best  discission i made when looking for a new carmy sale rep chase was amaaaaazing he made himself available no matter whatwhen you think of dealerships all that comes to mind is a allll day thing but not here my whole process was no longer than 2hrs
update just spoke to the manager and he is taking care of some things with the warranty and explained about the costco program a bit better
once we started talking numbers we agreed on a final price but a minute later the sales manager came out of his office offering us 200 gift cards and insisting that we let them change the final sales price that was agreed on to a higher number
however if youre going to offer a free car wash every x visit and you count the washes by license plate number put my plate in to the computer the same way every time
i worked with super steve and he helped me find the perfect suv
after many years i have had enough
alamo does a great job  thorough with great attention to detail and at a reasonable price
i recently had the transmission on my 2006 bmw m6 go bye bye the hard way pics attached and cars was there to get my car on the road again
do not buy here i repeat do not
he also quoted me a worstcase scenario replacing the compressorcondenser price that was about 300 less than what i was quoted by firestone
so  they sold me a car with a bad clutch  the car only had 40k miles  took it back a couple weeks later when i started noticing it i noticed it the first day i had it but was like maybe it just delays a little it has such low miles  nope  bad clutch  service told me it was going to be 160 to look at it  i talked to the salesman and finance  they blew me off like nothing  so i drove it as long as i could with a screwed up clutch  the clutch was 1200 to fix at the dealer  i got it done at a local shop for just over 1000 1 i and nobody i know will every buy a car from them again  2 that is what i get for buying a foreign piece of crap  i will only buy american or toyota they are mostly made in the us anyways  oh and free car washes
if you get a used car or a brand new nissan i urge you not to purchase their maintenance plan as long as their present crew is employed
he really makes a customer feel appreciated
i told him i wanted to just fill it up and he said no problem
he showed me options that were available for me and i was able to get the into the car that i wanted
jj showed a genuine interest
right then i realized somethings not right when a express lube shop has a sign holder working on vehicles
luckily the people here understood and exchanged our tire anyway
will never even think about this place ever again
the car runs great and looks great but we were never told about the scratches
the customer service was terrible
the loan process and buying process is awesome
think its time to find another car wash place
they have an automotive loan a tool program
couldnt be any more happy with my experience there
the assistant manager marilyn
he literally followed my inside and asked if my husband had a phone he could call to see if he could fix the window
now the real work begins in dealing with the legendary service department over the next few years
the parking spot 2 is a good option if you want uncovered parking
comfortable waiting area with snacks available to buy
the food here blows other thai food out of the water
for other technical details and improvements anyone can refer back to the bmw website
very low hourly charge
we asked for some other concessions if they left no room to negotiate and got offered one free oil change
you completely blew it and cant admit you are wrong
he is great at what he does reasonable with parts and labor and honest
they put the wrong size oil filter on my car   oil leaked all over engine
matthew haverkamp was a true expert in customer service
and then the icing on the cake i was told there now suddenly wasnt an issue and got less than 200 yards from the dealership before the problem resurfaced again
i asked him to punch it in and he rolled his eyes sighed and said im really not supposed to do that
so what they lack in some cosmetic things they make up in their service
excellent customer service
these guys made some changes
i think this is the best car wash option in ne scottsdale
excellent service w 2 uboxes
decided to use that location because they offer online coupons at their website
then he said if you want the window edges wiped thats a two dollar charge
they had several sports drink specials so i was able to get 2 bottles for just a little more than the price of one
the staff in this place is either clueless or geniuses i havent figured it out yet
if youre in the need of a new ford or a used vehicle they may have i would suggest them
i am beyond pleased with thomas professionalism quality of work and genuine friendliness
great customer service as soon as i drove in
great experience all around
didnt find it
i didnt have to sit in the waiting room but i the waiting room looked awesome
the 2013 we test drove was nowhere near this fast
if you have a car  these are the only folks i trust here in town
however they got me checked in quickly
this shop needs to retrain the staff
the people vehicles equipment and prices are all reasons to not look any further
ive been going here for several years and ive yet to experience anything other than top service from the service department
i did not get to meet him  but manager jack was a typical oldschool helpful great person who went out of his way to make us comfortable with the break work and wiring work they did
christian was so appreciative of my husbands time as an active duty marine and also being a teacher he repeatedly thanked him for his serviceteaching during the time we were with them
they reassured me that my suv would be returned by  a specific date exactly how it was prior to the accident
pricing is pretty good
i wish i had gone to sun devil auto instead like i had originally planned
the baked beans had perfect texture and richness if a little on the sweet side
they probably are the busiest in town because they overbook and dont honor appointments
chelsea was very pleasant and professional
5 stars for the amenities and customer service fast repair 0 stars for trying to take advantage of me
additionally he went above and beyond making sure my warranty covered all costs
i have never seen a dealerships service department close at 800 pm
great job christian
i have bought many many cars and this has been the best deal and experience i have ever had
recently was in an accident with my brand new truck  on the recommendation of my insurance agent i had it taken to rics
considering there is no benefit to staying with dsfcu compared to a bank like chase or wells fargo they have 24 hour customer service lines i am just going to make the move
my husband and i purchased a used bmw a few years ago that have had nothing but troubles
soda stations are always clean
the staff at ufixit center have helped me out on three separate occasions and each time they have been fair in their pricing accurate in their quotes and solved the problems that i came in with
although i have purchased many many cars in my life  i always dread the prospect of shopping for and buying a car
dealership says they do invoice only but charge so much more then any other jeep dealer
i was seriously in and then outta der in like 2025 minutes for tire rotation air and stuff
i took my e55 there on saturday morning when they opened and tony the owner quickly worked me in for a diagnosis
i recently purchased a used car that had a dash designs dash cover
rates were very fair and lower than ive ever paid for a tow
very satisfied with the communication price negotiation and service on all my vehicles
i wanted all the bells and whistles because i keep my cars for 810 yrs
best car buying experience ever
would recommend this place to anybody
not sure if i will be back
the mac and cheese was decent as were the baked beans
there are some truly amazing vehicles on display here
i was going to take another test drive when he brought out both matt and another brand specialist sal odzakovic
first time going here and was scared about the reviews but read this first before you cast judgement based on other reviews i took my car in for an oil change interior detail and an exterior wax
a youre paying for cosmetic differences
drove back with him and the steering wheel is perfect
omg what a rat hole
he did my brakes and changed oil in no time
when i called kb mechanic kenny got back to me within an hour of my call he lookd at my car for 65 on froday which was suppose to go towards the laborparts of my car he did a good job fixing my car although he did switch up the price we agreed on last minute he went from under 200 up to 265 and he forgot to accredit me my 65 onto my payment i called him the next day to let him know of the mistake that was made and he told me he would be at ny house at 430 to pay me in cash he never showed uonor answered my calls i went down to his shop a few days later just to be found it had recently been sold to another mechanic
thank you again to johnny matt louis james
the person on the phone was great
we still havent resolved this on monday night but i will never deal with these lowlifes again
fairway actually examined all four tires took one tire off and said heres your problem they fixed the issue and everything is awesome now
if you need a reliable car that holds its value and have a wonderful sales experience head over to the loop 303 and waddell and ask for ernie primera and he will take great care of you
not the greatest prices jacksons trailers has a decent location in mesa az if thats near where you are located
staff is courteous expedient  knowledgeable the best
i was concerned about my tierods or strutarms or whathaveyou so i took it to them for an inspection
i would recommend this auto repair service company to anyone in the area
my car was broken into and needed repair after numerous delays by the dealership and excuses even to my insurance company by them i finally received my car back after almost three weeks
i finally did the smart thing and started researching my alternatives thanks yelp
he told me he had a body paint guy that comes once a day and would ask him how much it would cost to paint match my powder white car
they handled it with the insurance and was able to get them to cover more
the attendant said it had to be a hard copy not just off my smartphone
and i also dont feel the response to how things work on the car is to read the manual
the sunday hours friendly customer service and great service prices will definitely have me returning for additional business
and my oil most definitely needs to be changed
the place is decorated with a bunch of pictures of celebrities reviews and authentic pictures
seriously read the fine print theres lots of things to look out for
i have been a customer of galleria express for years
jim manager even provides  recommendation for preventive measures with an estimated cost so you know whats going on with your vehicle before it happens i am a single female and has never been taken advantage of or overcharge for repairs
when i got to the service department and told them what happened they told me the car hasnt arrived yet and there was nothing they could tell me
but the lines were super long not only for trying to buy gas but also inside
the dealer ordered parts on may 22 and the next day after 720 and 6 hours of labor informed me that they were stumped as to the issue and would have to order more parts and spend even more time figgering out what the heck is wrong with my bike
not a t shirt
also russell from the financial department was also very accommodating
what price do you want to pay for the car
after i drove it for a day or two my car would bounce all over the road and would follow the grooves in the road which was pretty scary
however youll still need to take the day off of work like i did because itll take all day
i highly recommended these two guys daniel and david
i was recommended this shop after having not so great work at another place
we stopped in to this location as they had not yet visited
lots and lots of clothes
no extra made up repairs
the only reason i did business here is because i was looking for a very specific used vehicle from a certified honda dealer
my response was that i would not pay for such poor quality work and would not leave until they returned my money
another summer monsoon rolled through town yesterday leaving my truck spotty and dirty
or try to act as though the machine failed them for no reason
funny and honest
he came out to the car to demonstrate to me and sure enough there was no oil change light like he insisted
he didnt want to discuss the difference of the car he was offering and the car i wanted to buy
thanks again roco wholesale
they were really flexible to my schedule and the quote was less than what i was expecting
i dont know if the constant crowd was anticipated but you guys need to make adjustments
tires werent rotated even though the service advisor said all had been completed
il y a 2 niveaux gigantesques avec escalator spcial pour les caddies
tall blonde sooooo sweet
i hope and pray nothing happens to my engine because i need to know who will pay for my engine
what i would have expected to be really stressful was actually super easy
we recently were going to test drive through avis until we realized they did business with this company we are no longer buying through them
i didnt time it but my wait was under an hour and i made my afternoon appointment with plenty of time to spare
about 34 way through the cleaning i was watching through the window and so should you if you decide to go here i noticed they had not done the trunk yet
i give props to the people that actually clean the car
i usually go to discount but they were closed and decided to go to pep boys down the street
now i feel like im always lied to about the correct pricing the vehicles are never finished when promised and just overall bad customer service defitantly not near what it was with previous owner
i left my sam edelman booties in the back passenger floor
even though this is 05 miles from my house i will never return here
when confronted about the rudeness of making a customer wait that long without acknowledgment front desk guy upbraided husband about how if husband were on the phone hed have appreciated the attention
you have got to experience him for yourself and you will thank your lucky stars to have a life long new car detailer
friendly to boot
i took a photo of the massage chair at the lobby and above this chair is the tv in case you wanted to know about such things
i understand not being able to get parts tonight but not having a tech able to diag my car as they say because they only have one guy named david working tonight that is capable of doing it
josh installed the new battery and cleaned the corrosion off the terminals with no charge to me and i was able to still make it to work and not have to use a pto
this was a surprise to me but corey seeming to think it was ok for the 1146 in options he reduced my payment by 450 a month
decent car wash service but the attendants are like pirhanas trying to up sell
if you do a birthday package you get your own court for an hour and a party room with pizza drinks a tshirt and future passes for next time
all of them were bomb
returned last week for my first oil change and was very disappointed
whiskey island just happens to be one of the beautiful places in cleveland to enjoy our water front and its secluded to boot
got a good deal on a 2010 avalanche from brian
i came here earlier today 7172011 because i thought my car battery was dying and i wanted to replace it
then the number game comes out
i cannot emphasize enough the importance of a pre purchase inspection on any used car regardless of the marque
i left a message on another phone number
the zipcar locations are difficult to find at times
i didnt fill it up before returning it but said id go and grab a container of gas and fill it up real quick
as soon as i walked in i didnt get greeted immediately or was acknowledge didnt felt welcoming at all and the two staff there notice me standing by the register for a good minute to two minutes before seating me
why call it full service
i recently received a mail from that dealership containing scratch lottery ticket and a key with a chance to win a car
chuck is awesome
although they were short staffed when i came in and had to wait for for my turn to be helped i would still say the service they offer here is good
i went to this option because i was never happy with the job they did themselves
its a mine field but one has to negotiate if your want all manner of sundries
his concern is to get your car in and out as soon as possible even if the work isnt done
just a great place
had much higher hopes for the experience from this dealership same typical auto dealer run around its a shame could have been been so easy
the wheels were half cleaned off
very tacky and shouldnt be allowed at the counteronduty
i showed up to a very clean and neat shop
i would see them again if i needed to
look people we live in arizona
i love this jiffy lube
his honesty and straightforwardness was very refreshing in an era where everyone is trying to screw everyone else over
i had to schedule an appointment due to the airbag recall
this is the second time im using this company and they managed to do it again
this is officially our new auto service place
almost the entire time i owned my car there was a small oil leak that never got resolved yet they said it was resolved
shine works is a class act
called cna to make claim they said to have tire shop call them tire shop called them cna told tire shop to have me call them
we went over the tires id bought online and discussed why they needed to go in the back since i only bought 2 for now
chapman bmw is first class
best thai food ever
there was a huge puddle of oil underneath
the day i went in to service my car they were not busy at all
on the drive home on 215 my brakes locked up and caused an accident
unfortunately greulich is not a part of this honest group
i stated as much and said that if he wanted our business those things needed to be fixed
long lines earlier store opening time and diverse selections of seemingly crazy markdowns on items from all product categories
dont be fooled by the street price which looks like the lowest in the area  thats only for cash customers
they are our forever parking place when we go anywhere requiring a flight
i had a good experience
the entire process was a terrible waste of time
please never give your business to cml auto glass
mike loves his job and it shows
been shopping for a car for a while and the team at sahara dodge made it easy and stress free
i called to get a quote for new spring bushings in my 2004 f350
at that point  i said by the way one of the lugnuts is kind of stripped can you guys replace it
the labor alone on that job would have been a couple hundred dollars
one of the employees asked what scent of air freshener i would like and i really appreciated that he would come out of his way to ask me that
she called us because of his pressure and we said no
i went yesterday and purchased the 20 wash for my kia optima i havent washed in awhile and was expecting a really good job by the staff
i called four different shops and mvr gave the best price by far on my vw routan
are my parts are coming in i asked
the rice was fantastically aromatic and paired great with the mango
the costumer service was great but in retrospect i overpaid for a car with 2 accidents on car fax and 5 months later the transmission started to slip the car had less than 90000 miles
you can see whats going on  here for yourself
do yourself a favor and stay away from these guys
i purchased my car from berge and also get it serviced occasionally here as well
kelly helped me find a bike that was right for me and really helped me out with all kinds of issues that arose with the banks and insurance agency
we will definitely be recommending you guys to friends and family members
be sure to get a quote from your dealer on some items and 180 will match
the only reason i didnt give them five stars was that the receptionist was not customer service oriented
best experience ever hands down
absolutely the best mechanic ive ever had
my request was simply unacceptable to them
definitely recommend an appointment
again without reservation go see mike for your next used car experience
greathow does that resolve what he did to me
i figured it was a new cup
although a serious buyer as soon as i walked in the dealership no one bothered to say hi not even the front desk even though thats pretty much their job as soon as a customer walks in to see if theyve been served
i took my business else where
first and last time here
i cant believe how easy it was how convenient it was rather than lugging around my tires to a shop wasting over 3 hours round trip and gas than to just have the fiix guys come to my house and actually do it while i was saving time doing errands nearby
we didnt have gas stations like this at all
thank you all shine no grime
best shop i have ever been to period
then called excel who was asking 113
west ballard my service representative goes above and beyond the call of duty to always be available to help me  no matter what i need
good vacuums hoses
fast and loose
i told him that the guy that called me said he would help me get the part i need or at least write it down so i could find it
it is so well run it is a pleasure to sit here and watch them operate which gives me confidence in their work
worst dealership i have ever negotiated with
bonus points to their grand canyon service center for being on my way to the mall and next door to my atthemoment pho place in madison
the price was for any turn signal so my cheap part cost the same as an expensive signal say for a lexus
youll be out of business just like the last guy
i have thai food many other places but this was one of the best ones ive had
very low pressure
you talk to me so offensively
also asked her for a quote for 4 new tires for my son and was promised a call back friday
they said if they came in they would call me and get them installed
a young woman by the name deborah takes all five stars here for her kindness and helpfulness
at first i was a bit hesitant and wasnt sure if i should just wait for mike or deal with him
but not each and everyone of you need to do it
thanks 180 for the horrible service you have given us
i am in the hospitality industry with multiple customers who use services like this and i will make sure they know to never use epic
however when we started to negotiate on the car i had just test droveafter a couple of hours he discovered it did not have all the features he said it did
for you locals i say sun city is your best bet
he told them he needed to think it over after they just pissed him off
went to craig and mandy to find me a f150 that i wanted in every detail
you will know what you will get before they perform the work so if you think it is not reasonable you can decline the work
they found me on the computer confirm what services i wanted done and then i was off on my way
they were all under inflated
they were uncompromising when i asked if we could show up without a reservation and they did nothing to try and accommodate our group
he found us the exact vehicle we wanted and showed us all the great features and made the whole process which is usually a pain in the butt a joy
we told the sales guy to order a pizza for us
hes a great representative of the lexus band 100 percent
he stands up abruptly takes the paper we were looking at shakes his head holds up his hands in exasperation and tells us i am a man of my word i am just holding you to yours and walks away
lake mead is a must
i recently used tony for residential tinting
my car is still not there
i was told i could make the payment with the person on the phone and they are working to make it convenient
brett got me in and out in no time
i would highly recommend him to a friend
so far my experience has been poor customer service
its just where i go i have nothing too extraordinary to say about it either way
repaired my flat tire at no cost
they quickly checked it in 5 minutes and told me its not the wiring they installed its the lights on my trailer
we had it towed to this location and they called me first thing monday morning
it seems with every new location sxcw gets better and better as they learn about better designs and new technology to make your experience top notch
they did a very good job on my car
they should probably be running the place since no one else there knows how to do their job
all had one thing in common and that was poor customer service
i received a delinquent notice from them on my car loan
im absolutely going to follow up on other reviews and report them for renting out an unsafe car
the dealership is about 15 hours from my house
i had been trying to find a shop that was fair honest and friendly
that was all well and good but about 10 minutes in we hear screeching tires and see a new car from their inventory lock up the brakes and get the back end sliding right there on the lot coming out from the back of the dealership
they deliver work in a timely manner and have gone the extra mile to get hard to find parts at their own expense to get a job done
i actually found jim while searching for a second opinion on some brake issues i was having
i received a loaner car for the day no questions asked
just about everything youd want in a girlfriend but in mechanic form
i received a coupon in the mail for a free wash and went in this morning to get it done
this is one our familys favorite places for so many reasons
he took it apart and the distributor which should have been gold and and have a steel label gm05 rpt on it did not
when a dealership and the buyer can both walk away thinking they got a good deal you know you got a good deal
i show up to pick up my car when they pulled up with my car it had front bumper damage that had not been there with paint missing and scrapes like they hit something with my car
i replied a heads up would have been nice to make other arrangements so that im not screwed to which ofcourse he didnt respond at all
i went there to have my car for regular maintenance
i feel lucky to be involved with this dealership for the next few years
ive been here three times for an oil change hoping each time that they would be better for some reason
i have no basis of comparison within toronto but this place is 4 minutes for 300 so good or bad deal im not sure
i hope these guys stay in business forever so i will always have a great goto place to get my tires replaced
the right side of my bumper had deep scratches from bumping into a concrete base of a light post in a parking lot
maybe im jus a savvy customer but i thought the overall experience went well
i finally asked for my down payment refunded which was 3000
the person i spoke on the phone with to reserve my rental was vy
oh and the best price guaranteed so get a quick quote here and go to henderson
after preapproving online and picking the car we headed to the dealership
one of the previous mechanics who fixed the exhaust that was damaged remembered my situation from last year
if i had to break down anywhere i was grateful to be near imports by day audi
this place is very alright
after test drive at another dealer much closer with the usual baloney and lack of product knowledge
they even recommended a great body shop for me to get some front bumper damage taken care
i took my car here for a wash and decided to have an oil change done
pulled pork was very good
250kms 2 sets of batteries more time working on it than riding it
coming from new york i have seen many driving experiences but in crappy parking lots
i never had to complain about one single thing in 12 years
mike was quick to get me a quote and scheduled for the next day
this place is the best
they treat you with respect from the moment you enter till the moment you leave regardless whether or not you make the deal
would definitely recommend
i had come here to get my oil changed when i first moved to the area 4 years ago and couldnt remember why ive avoided it since
didnt even know this shop existed was just looking for a mechanic that was near my house since my truck is currently my only mode of transportation  was trying to avoid having to call someone to come pick me up or even worse take the bus home
i typically purchase jeeps through chapman at the valley auto mall but chose to visit a closer jeep dealer this time
had 2 vehicles to get nv plates and registration for
i have never found a tastier or cleaner wholefoods packaged veggie product on the market
i am a fan of both services the vacuum seems to last longer than most coin operated vacuums
sucks for them as i was in the market for another fun ride again
i informed them of how badly they did the tint
i bought my 2014 ford mustang today and the experience was great
had to get some new tires in a hurry
i went back to lovetts for a repair on my dodge ram 1500 ac unit
the fan controller is 199 from the dealer
it was only when i had gotten out of massage a couple of hours later did i notice that the shampoo had caused the stain to spread out to a larger area and the mat covering up the stain had not been cleaned
this is a great car wash and if your ride is dirty come here
i hope they enjoy my 154 because it will be the last money they will get from me
so im at lunch right now waiting on my car
tom personally inspects and does all the repairs
they put out coupons that arent valid and offer a smaller discount 3 off vs the 15 off
they checked it out fixed it didnt even charge me for service and sent me on my way
would never recommend to anyone going there
i highly recommend this place
at this point i was pissed off
the 3 customer service reps who i worked with truely believed that because they were not the same sales person who sold me the car it was not their responsiblity to help me and that i was essentially responsible because the sales person who i bought the car from no longer worked at cbb
granted i didnt ask so that may be my fault
my favorites are deep fried garlic prawns  nicely fried battered and garlicky
totally a hidden gem in vegas and deserving of all the exposure its gotten in media and from my peers
i highly recommend
i am so impressed with genes auto worx i feel like he only did and charged us for what needed to be done  no more no less
i was in such a rush the week of leaving on a road trip and realized i needed to get my brakes done and an oil change
as he my friend started to put it in he wiggled the old lightbulb around and sure enough it turned on
so i crawled under there and took a look for myself
long story short there was nothing wrong with the valves or the alternator
watched 10 cars after me leave
although i didnt end up buying a car from wilde i really appreciated the time and effort that jerry o put into making his sale
i stopped in after work not knowing what to expect and even if they could check my battery
first of all the looming salespeople hanging around where you pull your car into is ridiculous
when i brought it in for a quote i was told that it was a very difficult dent to get out but they would try their very best
so we ventured on down to autonation toyota
what a bad joke this place is ill refrain from repeating the outright lies i overheard a female sales manager tell a nice fatherson while waiting
also i may be a woman but dont you dare talk down to me i feel like this advisor was doing that to me when i was asking him about a concern of mine
again do not use this business
after shopping around his shop offered the most competitive pricing as wellat least 75 cheaper from any other competitor that i found
thank you steve nick and mike who always make us feel like family and the food is always good
i live out in north phoenix and make it a point to bring my bike in here
sorry thats my auto insurance adjuster pitch
they did some leg work and really sold us on how honest they really are
just a terrible place that ive been going to for yearsi will not be returning when my pre paid car wash card expires
i told him the whole experience felt like they were trying to get me in to fix a flat only to sell me a tire and that there was no flat warranty at all
they are very friendly and fast
i have been coming here for over a decade  the touchfree automatic drivethru is awesome
surprisingly my car look better now than before the accident
jack and his team are honest business owners and enthusiasts who take the time to understand what you are trying to accomplish with your car
the price ended up being nearly the same as the 2nd hand bicycles i found
mike was going to charge me full price to change computer even though i felt like it was something he had a hand in
then i lucked out and got a quick appointment with noelle due to a cancellation
i originally talked to him before he turned me over to elsie
i bought tires from discount tire about three years ago
it was delicious and satisfying
im looking forward to seeing my movie
so if you have anything drivetrain related or even brake jobs call the guys ask for brick
i stopped going to the dealership years ago because theyre overpriced and dont pay attention to really fixing your car
see dalton in sales
richard was great with helping me fix my car
i took it to another mechanic and they told me they never even added the free on to check for leaks because if they had done so the ac wouldve blown cold for at least a day or more depending on the size of the leak
girl at checkout was extremely courteous
during the time i was making calls they were the ones who could begin the move the soonest
i havent seen my suv looking this clean in a while
i only wanted to add gap coverage and he did not push me beyond that
very odd
this week i checked the reviews on yelp  decided to visit findlay honda
im still not happy with the quality of work done but dont want to deal with them anymore
the massage chairs are sooooooo relieving too not the cheap chairs you get at the nail salon either
nothing but great service great prices quality work
it took me another 30 seconds to reseat the gasket and clamp it shut
no stripped bolts no misaligned flanges all wiring was nice and neat
larry showed up at the scheduled time
i had a lot of anxiety walking in since it was my very first time buying from a dealership
im so very happy with the tinting job they have done on my car
so the plates that were on the vehicle my son was using were no good
let me start by saying this is the first time i have ever reviewed anything
unwilling to dispute this  and figuring that they would sort it out once they had the thing apart  i left my bike there
i normally loathe talking to salespeople though sometimes i detest it and occasionally i abhor the encounters with the disdain of a multitude of plagues with car salespersons at the top of the revolting list
a big thank you to gregg renne and all the crew at autocrafters
i wouldnt accept an answer like this if it was a ford pinto
because the car was towed to the shop and they understood we cant tow it back it was inoperable
because unfortunately their facility only has one restroom made for a pretty long line during breaks
and left without getting his car done
good staff quick service and great pricing
horrible service from the office personnel
stay away is the best advice i can give
after saying no thank you about 5 times i was pulled by another guy asking for my insurance and that he would fix a scratch in my window
they were easy to talk to and very helpful
joshuah was extremely honest and helpful
of late i had the car stored and it got some rub marks on it that just really bugged me seemed like thats all i saw
they called me and said i needed a bunch of work on my brakes
this is actually in contrast to a lot of other auto places in the valley
the shuttle had just arrived so i bid him farewell and went to the shuttle
i recommend them for any issues with your car
might be the only one ive ever given a 5 star review to
i thought that was crazy since the girl at the cashier had just said the car was washed
it was a truly unfortunate experience and i felt like i ended up being the victim of someone elses incompetency
by the time we drove off the building it was 1105am
first time here and checking the place out
they really worked with what i needed
there is no possible way i can recommend this place
for you hard working people out there that have to stretch evert penny my advice to you is shop around lie to these mobsters like they lie to us tell them you got a better deal some where else
ce la vie its a car
i walked into toyota and the first thing i saw was the corolla the moment i saw it i was set on that car
the idea of calling the driver to let him know that someone need a ride to pick up the vehicle is too much to expect
so i said okay works for me
the toilet works wonderfully and your guidance made it much easier
later jerry helped tweak the engine to start up with less sputtering quiet down while running and use less gas this is easy  you can manually adjust the choke in the summer time
fair enough i guess the mistake was realized after the fact
i traded in my 2010 civic lease and leased a 2012 civic on saturday
anyway at the end of 3 weeks we were told that all the parts had been received from ups but that the 5 foot rail had been lost
dis place be da bomb
one star is too high a rating
i bit the bullet and was glad i did
so my opinion is very much from my heart
i cleaned the rest up when i got home
they just walk by you like your not there
second they are straight up honest
it saids that you guys are open 24 hrs
afterwards i still had squealing and vibration and brought my car in again
what a cunt
i took my car back two more times and greg continued to tell me that everything was fine with my car and nothing was a problem
i did not walk over to my car and pop the hood for him instead i simply took it to drellishaks
they make buying a car enjoyable
you wont die or get hurt
i went for a test drive and wasnt expecting to like the car as much as i did
i had been hoping for a little rag to wipe out the interior but am not sure if the rag was part of one of the other packages so i will investigate again and let you know
he should crawl back into what ever oil pit he came from
every few years it got a new coat of paint and a different brand name sign went up
i had my oil change and the car washed
i like shopping here but dont like the hours
being late we didnt have time to fill up the tank like you are supposed to
if something comes up which i hope it doesnt lol and i have to go there for service then i will up date my review accordingly
the theory is that there may be additional threads up a little higher that are not stripped
it took a few more minutes than id like but all of the numbers were exactly as wed agreed and the car was precisely as i was told it would be
maybe you will consider these as well
i was impressed he was willing to take an hour of time off the sales floor
i will update my rating as soon as a resolution has been reached
we saved 60 if we went to big car cleaning chains but got more for our money
will never return
we were so happy with it that i took my car to dan a couple of weeks later to get my front windows tinted darker to match the back windows
the inside door handle wasnt actually broken albeit a bit loose
amazing spot today was my first time
it was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory
not only did they reserve me a vehicle they didnt have but i have never been so shocked by an employee
sorry but not sorry
then they try and upcharge you with everything that is wrong
this dealership is a joke
as of today 10315 no one has contacted me
great company with fantastic customer service
but i was told that my car was  considered extremely soiled  in order to use my deal here is what he told me 1 if you want u car seats clean which was not included in the deluxe package you need to upgrade the deal 30 2 to remove salt off the floor of my car 40 and he said will give me 12 off
im a loyal customer from now on for sure
he supported me and i support them
went in for an oil change and to get my brakes fixed on my firebird
noticed one muffler was bent in shipping but both were slightly off
they quote me over 750 to fix this mystery gasket causing a vacuum leak
i have never had my car detailed or taken advantage of the oil services however i have had many carwashes
the whole service was actually great
the staff was very nice and got my car for much better deal than most places
wait  they already washed it once
id rather pay more else where and get good customer service
to add insult to injury they also forgot to use the air freshener i had requested
however jon did tell me that brian would at least need to make his presentation and at least give us the opportunity that he needs to give all his customers
replace your windshield
i was looking for new toyota corolla 2015 s plus and after talking to many toyota dealers i did not get an affordable deal
job 2 to fix the molding kyle did was excellent
with as many holes i seem to get its worth it
my family has done business with them for over twenty years
we arent handling anymore
i almost feel like community tire and autos service is a secret that needs to be shared so others can experience the peace of mind i have since discovering them myself
the only reason they get three stars instead of one is because they were so much cheaper than the dealership i guess im getting servicewise what i paid for
needless to say i felt pressured from the market street guy that hell give me a 50 discount on 4 michelin defender tires for my 14 ford focus but i had to pay for them that day before i could bring my car in
im so glad to see qt at this location
sell a kidney pawn your discman or roll your pennies instead
no wonder they can have so many of these places storming the city  with good stuff outside and in they are like a money machine
i got 4 brand new tires that day along with new old hubcaps for a total price just under 400
mopar called me and seem to act like they where concerned about my issues
frenchy sold us a new to us car this week
absolutely amazing work
by the time i noticed the entrance  i was already past it
i came in to get my oil changed without an appointment and they were very accommodating
definitely worth the 2 mile trip off the strip for great quality that cuisine
every single person i spoke with informed me that the vehicle called for standard conventional motor oil
brought my old 1975 chevy truck in running rough if not scary
they are open 24 hours so that is very convenient when u need something
the big sign out front is advertising a special on cleaning carpet
never taking my truck her again
wash wizards was a twenty minute drive from my house but it had great reviews and noticed that the owner of the company paid attention to the reviews and was happy to respond in a friendly manner
i got an exterior detail on my 4runner
my husband blair and i couldnt be more pleased
george was our salesman and he was really nice and jacob was the finance manager
original review if i had written this review 3 years ago they would have gotten 5 stars
worst business that i had to deal with in the last ten years
1st off we are from odessatx 800 miles away and we were looking for the exact tahoe they had
looks like its the other way around
all i got was every excuse as to how there was no possible way they could ever do that not even on their worst day
i actually left a used car lot with my dignity intact
this was the most ludicrous thing i have ever experienced
when i asked him what his deal was he spewed some of the most disrespectful things ive ever heard and stated that he has worked at this store for 4 years they need me here i run this place you are nobody im busy and dont have time to talk to you noone in store all of this after i spoke to him like normal and calmly
kevin is fantastic
smart automotive is a long time reputable and dependable repair shop near downtown scottsdale
soooo  long story short   avoid going to these douchebags at all cost
so happy i came across them on my lunch break very convenient for me
i had an amazing experience here
we leave tomorrow
on tuesday i wasted over an hour on the phone with them trying to get an appoinment for friday
if you go ask to see his mastiff
they didnt do the complimentary rinse which was offered to me not solicited
i visited the cobblestone auto spa last week the day after phoenix survived the historic 100 year haboob dust storm
at no point was he frustrated or in denial of the damages
for almost two hours i waited outside on the bench
i also asked because the price was so low what monthly payments would be estimated at
i got the oil change and that was it
safelite offers a mobile service which is nice since they can replace your windshield at your house at work wherever your heart desires essentially
how considerate of them
we called the next morning trying to get in touch with dominic and for one reason or another were told he wasnt available but that he would get back with us which he never did
the professionals i spoke with on the phone were helpful kind knowledgeable and courteous
just simply great
after reading these negative yelp reviews i felt compelled to review  as the streamlined and seamless of my previous hertz experience held true at the las vegas airport rental centre as well
even though this is a well known fact if you ask any service adviser at a cadillac dealer they will say they have never heard of the problem which is laughable and cadillac will tell you this isnt a defect isnt covered under any warranty and the only fix is 2 new heads
called all over to get prices on oil change and found dinos to be the most cost effective
ryan come to my house today and repaired 3 of my black chrome wheels and they look awesome
like all quick trips they have free air for your tires if needed thats a major plus in my book
my car was a filthy mess and there was no way a clean freak 499 drive through wash would do the trick
but what happened last week really pushed me to the point of writing this review
there was no one there to give me a refund
we were in on the last day of august and willing to close on the vehicle if you would have it
i had the pleasure of doing business with a popalock locksmith by the name of jim today
and by time i got back to my car i could already see the results of the smog test on the screen a big fat pass
i will forever be a repeat customer
they have netflix to watch as you wait offered me water and explained the process and prices very well prices are very fair and product turned out great
my car was involved in a hit and run and i went to allard and i was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail and time they took in making sure all my concerns were answered
danny tells us he does then takes us to 4runners that are all way over 30000
two gentlemen greeted me when i got in one of them was clark and they listened to the issues i described with my car then went out to inspect it to see what they could find out
stole my money
we were just passing through the area and needed a flat fixed
i was quoted approx
they do a really bad job and the manager is so rude she slammed the door only my car for asking if they could clean the windows which they should have done without me asking
das essen war wirklich super lecker
here comes jenny again i got another temp license for another 30 days to facilitate the dmv delays
got there at 430 to pick it up windows streaky car mats soaking wet thrown in the back and it was just coming out of the bay
he asked if i had an appointment which i thought was a ridiculous question since i pulled into the no appt lane i told the gentleman no
they broke a lot of stuff as well glassware a box spring mattress etc
after all papers are signed john informs me about this other finance company and that they decided to go with them because of the interest rate so of course i ask if this is guaranteed financing
hmm maybe because marco is a snake taking innocent people for a ride who dont know any better
we scheduled this appointment ahead of time
we purchased our brz here almost 3 years ago and have had it serviced here ever since even though we live in northern arizona
bill came out to a little under 9000 for reference
i have to pay more to get the same problem fix
it oversees the pricing of the repair
she tried answering my questions she couldnt so she got carlos involved and this guy was very knowledgeablehoneststraightforward
was told that they would hold the car an extra day and have the master tech try to replicate the problems to try to solve the issue got a call and text the next day telling me that the car is all clear and ready to go anywhere
i got there at 915 and talked w daniel
second time was this past sunday day before memorial day
after being  denied service by a local bmw dealership  dessert bmw i thought i was doomed no one likes to be stranded on vacation but i decided to do some research and found euroasian   and saw a lot of awesome reviews so i took my car there i usually work on my car myself but i was on vacation and it was an emergency i honestly feel great about my experience at there repair shop and felt like it was money well spent good jobs guys keep up the good work
i did not reschedule as i expect that would probably be cancelled by them again i expected better
see you in court
thank you mrron your business and service is everything its supposed to be
if your vehicle is stolen these lowlifes excons and folks who are more likely to be found living under a highway overpass will be summoned by some police agency to tow the vehicle to their holding lot and when you go to claim it theyll add insult to your injury being a theft victim by charging you an outrageous amount of money to have them release it to you
a new 2012 at the time and a 2009 that we were told was certified
the dealership contacted dent guys to repair
i have an f350 and just fold the mirrors in and go
first time i called told the womqan my problem and i said i really need to speak with someone asap
dealing with their vp never once was an apology for the inconvenience issued
after hours they finally notified me that because i had an american car there was a part recalled and theyd have to have it for two days to service it in order to replace the part okay cool until i called back and they had no idea what i was talking about
amazing service and great prices
prices are always transparent and reasonable
i get 10mpg in town 12 on the hwy not their problem
best uhaul location ive ever been to
one quick look at my purchase history and they looked after me
i have talked to  5  a55holes from here  each one said they put me on a do not call list
i just moved to las vegas from knoxville tennessee
dont buy a car from this guy ever
bad promises and bad customer service
i will continue to bring my car therefor future repairs
after telling them this they told me i probably had enough to get me to the next oil change
so with no pto hours to use for thursday morning work i had to call aaa to tow my car to a near by tire shop
youll have a miserable experience
well i had an inspection done with a recent oil change at the time and ganley bedford said everything looked good except one thing
they took me right away it took about 15 minutes and i was on my way
i would certainly recommend bumperdoc to anyone that needs help with their car repairs
adam sorry adam ive already given out my award this year for best owner response to a yelp review
i wish i could give them a zero score
they are honest knowledgeable and caring
i just wrote what had happened to me at his business
it only took me a few minutes as i used to be a mechanic but for basically everyone else the fact that they cannot bleed brakes could mean the difference of stopping or crashing your car
dave saw that the back brakes werent adjusted properly and the fronts were doing all the work
do not go here
one visit awhile back
he called back saying we needed a new 12 volt battery 380 suggested  a maintenance  service    500  and replacing 2 burned  out clearance  bulbs 64
never finished this review
he felt no pressure at all from the sales team
i will definitely be back and highly recommend this locationstore
top 3 places to eat in the us
he charged 300 for the part and labor and i was able to head in to work only a few hours late
if you are looking to get your car washed in a relaxing setting avoid this place
then i found out they actually specialize in all makesmodels
had an appointment with michael this morning
honest and actually wants your trust
we love everything about this shop they feel like family
i wont be going back
this past sunday they were spot on in their price for the fan clutch and new radiator i purchased and really helped with the tools i borrowed
then he handed us over to a sales guy steve who came after a fifteen minute wait
we have no money and no time and nick and the staff at network automotive got us back on the road cheap quick and done right
the second vehicle that they provided had medication that are twoyearold found
gone are the days of clean orderly displays that entice a shopper to browse
this place is a waste of time and money dont go there
dear god do not let these people get your contact info
poor customer service after the sale
kyle scott and pamela are very great people
it was nice knowing they are not trying to swindle you
he had no interest in making me happy and his explaination of charging 80 more for black interior verse tan was weak
considering this is over a month later with the bulk of it being trying to reach dale never returns calls never calls when he says he will except when i said i would come in
best service ever
so right now we are still waiting for assistance
no concern for customers waiting
the owner dontel will make sure you love your car and that you are very happy 6232277857 ask for dontell he will take very very good care of you and get one of his painter out to you when its a good time for you they work with you on the best day and time for you and no waiting somewhere at all they come to you
even though i had the print out of what was quoted
the funny thing is brad gave us an inventory list with pricing for all available vehicles and everything was priced so fair that we ended up test driving a handful of cars that were all well within our budget
i was told my car would do several different things it does not do
the lifetime guarantee is pretty awesome as well
had appointment for oil change
when we tried to talk to a manager on the phone he said it wasnt false advertising but an external mistake
gave the person at the desk my name explained the problem and within 10 minutes they worked on my tire and i was out the door within 20 minutes
the clerk did not mention this sheet
but it was a painfully slow process with customer service and like nothing with their employees was organized in the least
he made me feel like i was interrupting him and was not helpful at all
i dealt with 2 sales people the first time i went in on monday 3312014 and agreed on a deal signed the paperwork they ran credit report it was 11pm and said i could return at 6pm the following day on tuesday 412014 and the car would be ready all the paperwork would be ready in finance for us to sign and be on our way
my friend bumped into a tree which left a huge dent on the car and also a pretty good scratch on two panels of the car
the last few times i took my car for a express wash they didnt do that great of a job
the car has everything i want on it and i absolutely love it
the more he spoke the angrier he got
used their financing and it was painless and easy
the automatic wash here is awful
why would this company hand over two keys that are locked together
i mean they forgot to give me the air freshener thats supposed to come with the package but thats not a huge deal to me
i have since gone there for miscellaneous items and will shop nowhere else for any car needs
the prices are decent
the parking is covered the shuttle vans come frequently probably every 1015 mins and the service is efficient and friendly
the tech stuff keyless access 9 speakers gps blind spot alert etc are way better than what i had expected
what about 30 minutes
thank you and goodluck in your search
all of my items scanned properly i paid with debit and the machine even dispensed canadian tire money automatically
of course i declined this generous offer
this was an upgrade which was ok for us in the end
if you can help it dont rent from here even if it saves a few bucks
worst place ever for tire replacement
while i do not recommend that you take your car here even for a recall if you do be sure to avoid having anthony as your service manager from talking to other customers he is consistently poor at communication while the others tried to be helpful when he was not available
never have i had such problems with salesman service customer service mechanical service
the extremely high pressure sales was excessive even for an auto dealership
over priced for the quality of work done on the car
they continually told us things that ended up being false
a week or 2 had passed and i never received a call from this place about the order very unprofessional
he came back with another lower offer and still not enough so i said no
the whole process was quick and painless and they didnt keep me any longer than they had to
we saw one that was nice but not quite exactly what we were looking for
cant ask for more in a mechanic
this is what people are raving about
really horrible customer service  they lie about appointments wait times  even how much its gonna cost
we used this company  rv guy mobile rv service 18777848988 rvguynet he was wonderful
im a picky bastard and the shop understands
they tell you what tires fit your car and additionally provide ratings for each with reviews so you know exactly what you are getting
manny is always up front with me and never tries to bully me into paying for something i cant afford at the time
so i can say that like ken kris isnt trying to make a quick buck off of lack of knowledge
ive never felt that way since switching to alexanders
to date the mesa location is one of the better experiences i have had
bought a 2015 acura tlx
he listened to what i needed and helped me find exactly what fit my situation
for someone that has a job thats a little challenging
i was in las vegas visiting a friend and borrowed her car
they met me on a saturday morning when they are generally closed so that i could have it for my event
long version we spent about one month visiting all of the volkswagen dealerships in the valley
i will continue to only come here to have any of my vehicles fixed
they refunded the 805 overcharge and true to my word here is the updated review
the mobile app can tie to multiple payment methods such as credit card or even paypal you can add any vehicle to the mobile app to be able to pay for parking including rentals and out of province vehicles including us plates the app can notify you when your parking will expire beforehand  green p ftw
we also got the fried duck with drunken noodles and that was pretty good too
i bought a new forrester at this dealership and the sales process was about what you would expect
just go to the north end of the building that hertz is located in
they had the highest price out of any other dealership in town on the subaru foresters
not happy with the salesperson and their tactics to bait and switch deals
i thanked him josh
plus ive been hearing good things and the fact that theyve been around for a while also helps
good people who believe in good karma
they wont let you take photos or retrieve things from your car without tons of documentation and even after i personally provided such documentation i think her name was jo was consistently rude and wouldnt let me out into the yard for about 40 minutes but she seemed to have plenty of time to converse with her male coworkers
they all said i should just sit tight as the car wash doesnt actually open for 10 more minutes
its clean and busy but the employees dont know how to smile or even fake that they are happy to be at work
i definitely recommend john johnson to ladies especially but guys too of course
always have friendly staff
best option for you car lovers who dont want to run the risk of scratching spiderwebbing damage or incomplete washes
such a disappointment
but ill find a different dealer next time
i was only in town a few days and she worked around the clock to get me a replacement windshield
stay out of the surprise dealership
i bought a jeep here in feb 2015  at that time the dealership was apparently adding two things to every new vehicle they sell  something called datadot dna and an aftermarket security system called a karr alarm
kevin chalker also made sure my truck was capable of towing my trailer and suggested a few improvements to it for safety
d no one ever ever has to get brakes done at a dealer  theyre usually over priced but the guys were competitive
we decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs fatty brisket and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw beans and chocolate pudding
it has been a long day of car shopping but we are so happy with our choice and couldnt and wouldnt of wanted it any other way
u will feel very confident on the road and very happy about driving
its a truck stop and they have a subway too
i promptly went back into best buy to return it and they would not let me return the soft ware stated that it was my fault that i didnt know what computer i had
wed made reservations about a month previous so we had few if any hiccups though we did heed the advice of showing up exactly on time
i love my new convertible
the mango was very fresh and perfectly ripe and sweet
yeah im seeing that youre trying to make things right but its just not fair to offer dessert when my friends didnt even get dinner
after several yelp finds later i came across kb mobile auto repair
from my understanding the prius cv will most likely not get replaced and only the standard prius and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up
this was a terrible experience as a customer and cannot believe they treated a used 40k car as much as 100k car
thank god i called bela
he really is an honest mechanic
i contacted him mid morning and by midday he had a recommendation and quote over to me for my volt
with 60 months 0 interest the deal cant be beat
never try to sell you anything and always have work done in a timely manner
this may have to be the worst managed repair shop ive even experienced
this info is all in your car manual and experience and tell them what you dont want donelike air in your tire
the absolute worst customer service
after i rented the machine i was told that i would pay when i returned the machine
very disappointed as we liked working with the guys directly
bait and switch
the mechanic who drove the car back to the shop had dust from the paint on his shoes and it was evident all over the driverside floor
i knew i had to get this tire leak fixed today so i drove on over to mcfalls crossing my fingers that the additional drive time was going to be worth it
i went to firestone today to have my rear brakes replaced and my front rotors checked due to vibration
sales person told us our 500 visa gift  card would be shipped after christmas but when we called to know abt the gift card they said oh that wasnt in the deal
i cant figure out what everyones problem with the service center is
my credit is not that great
high pressure addons and incompetent service
we had to wait in line at customer service to get our oneday pass and did we ever wait
we were pleased to know that the battery was under warranty as we have had one of those weeks where it seemed every time we turned around there was more money coming out of our savings
stopped by mad hatter today to have a magnaflow muffler installed on my car
the came fast and help me with my lock problem
i had a 2012 camaro zl1 that i took into service years ago and was not impressed by the service or lack of it
this is amazing customer service
very simple process
the service department was excellent having a loaner waiting for us and meeting their schedule date on time
had those checked 3 days later and they were both working
they also tell you that the bank isnt on boardbut honda was financing the car so its not the bankits their own financing companyjust another trick to try and get more money out of youlol i paid for my 45 taxi home and called it a day
their lease specials are incredible
the pros at discount were able to track down a 30 series tire for my benz in just a few hours
which other car washes do not cater to my vehicle because of the accessories on the top of my truck
i smell something strange this week
my goal is to keep the thing safely running forgoing a new car payment for as long as possible
everyone from the owner to the staff was awesome and chill
i was impressed
my service adviser is shane hackelton could be wrong on the spelling there one of the most honest people ive ever encountered in the auto industry
and i spoke with a manager to see if they can at least give me a minor leeway
thanks so much guys i will be referring you guys from here on out and using you in the future
total trust earned
was the first appointment of the day for my service advisor at 7 am
so i got a second opinion from another car shop also highly rated on yelp and they told me that i dont need brakes and wont for quite some time
had just recently replaced my others not long before
almost immediately four guys are on it like flies on shit
to say the least each wheel was straightened to dealer specification and my car rides like new
well i found my guy
im not sure why oil changes usually take over an hour here regardless if its a weekday or weekend
even got a free gift
also i have one year of free maintenance and 100000 miles of bumper to bumper warranty coverage something my used vw did not offer
when i took my car in to get the yearly smog a year after getting my dash replaced to jiffy lube i was told that i didnt have a vin number on my dash and that i cant get smog at any location except for a specific smog center somewhere in vegas
i called alamo and they promised they could get it looking great if i ordered the full detail
jackie refused to do so and said my car would be dried immediately
i was not expecting the level of service i received nor was i anticipating be greeted and escorted around by the owner
the express wash is solid
and there are no pressure tactics like you have to do this or your car will explode
regardless i hope people will ignore lynns response since it cannot be considered a genuine review
the coaches stayed outside
after inspecting my car they took me back and showed me that my worst pad was at 75 and walked me through my concerns and gave me some suggestions on how to fix it without throwing away hundreds of dollars
when i asked what happened next she just said i dont know i give the paper to someone else and then they decide if you have to pay for it which i am currently waiting to hear about
i could have sworn this used to be a brush free wash
as a woman i sometimes feel uncomfortable coming into a car wash as i always feel they are always to sell me things i dont need
when we left they still didnt know what the problem was
make sure to call alex if you ever need to get your car towed
the best shop and group of guys to trust your vehicle with
on thursday morning i drove back to the shop on west polk i live in tempe and the truck was sitting in middle of the shop pretty much where i had seen it the day i dropped it off
i picked up the truck and drove it home
went there to purchase a dodge charger and james took great care of me
my heater always awesome doesnt even pump hot air a clear oily fluid leaks onto my garage floor a flushing sound of fluid transferring back and forth sounds behind my ac unit i can smell burning my hood was damaged and my computer warning beeps on and off telling me i need service or i have a low tire but it doesnt beep when my seat belt isnt fastened like it used to
this review is for sales
they ran in the back to bring out a sample of the leather backed covers
i am very glad that i bought my car from 1 cochran
when my car got serviced i met jeff the service manager
i figured i knew the problem the window does not go up and down correctly
theyre communication is minimal
thank you again drive time
larry miller toyota wanted 275 and wait 10 days
if your in vegas and need repairs definitely come here
he was wasting my time  and i will not coming back here again at all
a mere 5 days after the first time i took my car in another light went on indicating something wrong with the gas tank
they recently did the service and i thought my brake pads were shot
michael is the best mechanic in the valley hands down
they have no integrity what so ever
i will return but i will definitely ask more questions and request the detail that i desire on the car
the khao soi was definitely the star of our meal
its rare to find honest auto shops like this
it cost me pennies more to deal with them and its worth every nickel spent
i love the lemongrass especially
while my car was in the shop my key fob broke  stephanie promptly ordered a new one at their cost
when i told them all i wanted was the oil change the service guy almost became upset with me
she directed us to her office and placed 2 papers on her desk
all i want is my money back and he said i had to call corp office and pointed to the wrong number on the wall i mean wow so lets see what happens but just know this place is not recommended for anyone
they offer a pre tunnel spot for pre bug scrubbing and truck bed clean out and then post tunnel along the side of the building theres ample covered outdoor bays each equipped with free vacuums and compressed air hoses for drying off and getting the inside taken care of
thank you kenny  team
honestly this is never a happy place to end up but if you do theyll get the job done
there are no mechanical problems with it
no care for the customer just bringing in money and ripping people off
thats right less than half the price of the other place
the technician who was chosen to fix my tire sauntered slowly into the waiting area along with his unfriendly demeanor and put his hand out to gesture for my keys without saying a word
i had a life time guaranty and he still didnt want to fix it and wanted to charge me 80 extra
they took a 200 deposit and added a bunch of fees to use all if it but 40
i bought my car sometime ago and set up a payment arrangement for the remaining down payment at least 6 months ago
as a woman who does not speak car he made it easy didnt try to scare me into unnecessary repairs
fast forward to 430 and i have not heard back from the rep  i make a phone call and he tells me the technician doesnt think its the starter but he would call back to the shop and see if there was another update and would call me right back
i have to say everyone i dealt with at berge vw was wonderful
the price was always fair and the work was always done impeccably
being a woman i never feel sure about taking my car anywhere
i went one day at 1230pm
on to the entres which were a mixed bag for me
i usually end up with a clean car at a fare price
i see you guys have done this to other buyers in the past
we didnt have reservations so we showed up about 15 minutes before they opened and joined the line that had formed
when he came to the house he inspected the car and apparently dog hair in the car is extra 15 dollars to be exact
leased my first bmw here and now my second
good place to buy or have your tires check
we were very happy with what can be a stressful experience looking at used cars
initially i went through the internet department to check availability and prices
they offered us water cake and soda while we waited
best big o tites in las vegas
this was admitted to me by andrew chan a sales rep there
at least in my book
i wasnt ever pressured to upgrade on anything
sooo i locked myself out all the staff was very helpful and shiloh finally got my car open in time for me to make it back to work
camelback mazda just keeps calling trying to sell me service
either a scummy or poorlyrun business
i will definitely continue to take all my car  needs here
pick up time was 9 am
i would never recommend this place
i called billy and told him that i had done the testing and that the suv had passed emissions
mr lube how you suck ass and are nothing but cheaters  thinking i wouldnt find out
everything looked good on the spot at the time but as i drove around in the sun that day i noticed just how poor the job was
i was very satisfied with pep boys
this place is amazing
i will definatley be coming back to this jiffy lube
i have never touched my tires so this had to be caused by the dealership
wow im surprised these guys dont have more reviews
i will be back if im ever in this area when i need anything
this is all really disappointing because their location is convenient and wed actually been considering buying a new cherokee trailhawk from them
great crash test ratings plus it has more room than lance
and only one of them was nice
besides riding a motorcycle more often than he eats hot meals marco is also a certified welder and aircraft mechanic
when you first walk in its definitely a cool atmosphere
i would be willing to pay extra for that
they also have a bomb chicken bake and super delish parfaits
ill drive across town to go to a different one
he helped find the exact car i was looking for and would recommend carl to anyone going there
i was looking to purchase a car off autotraderca and needed some advice
we scheduled an appointment several days ahead of time
absolutely plan on making this the only place ill take my bike
scott was nice to work with very helpful
my husband is very particular about who he lets touch his car let alone work on it
scheduled appointment for state inspection and oil change
pieces of dog crap from the associates on the floor to the store manager
cant say enough good things about this dealership at least the service department
the cost was very reasonable and i was very pleasantly surprised
easy to work with
check check and check
it felt like amateur hour when i took my nephew in to buy a new civic
i can live with that and id definitely go back
poor service is universal
when he arrived he explained his process and how the pads on his machine worked
this is the only discount tire store i go to
they were friendly helpful and professional at getting my project done on time and done right
im starting to wonder if courtesy chevrolet has access to delete reviews
when i asked greg about this his reply was oh well you never asked me if there were any paint chips
also the pressure sales upon arrival was too much
well not quite but it certainly is five stars and then some for our sales consultant craig rusin
super fast friendly inexpensive and convenient since they can register your car with the dmv from there
when i told him what i needed he went from one service advisor booth to another asking each service advisor if he would come out and write up a work order
i have referred this shop to friends and family and always hear glowing reviews
we decided to give daves a chance and im so glad we did
best customer service quickest friendliest best deal on tires hands down
first of all you would think after giving him so much business the service rep would have at least told me there was a coupon on their website for a 99 alignment and one for 10 off repair
overall a fantastic experience and a good deal for the money
nice guys but slow
hopefully will last another 100000 miles
my vehicle had started pulling to the right and if you took your hands off of the steering wheel it would head for the curb
i pledge my patronage to franks european
their pizzas are pretty tasty as well and super affordable which is good when you have two hungry and growing kids at home that never seem to stop eating  snacking
bought a second car from them hoping to have a better experience with them the second time around and surprise it was even worse
mark is possibly the nicest most knowledgeable mechanic in town
maybe they did
my wife and i stopped in to have a look at the new victory magnum
watch for coupons
many thanks to john thames for taking care of all my little warranty issues and delivering a great product  service every time
the first car after two years in the desert sun still looks as good as the day it was done
so for that i thank them and will go back to them again and highly recommend anyone who is thinking of going to them to go
just went there 2 days ago for a sunday breakfast
anyway we go into eds office
will definitely be back
i called and set up an appointment
and to the rude assistant manager dude put a smile on
my other place always took at least 30 minutes so i really didnt expect this short amount of time
then the scandal broke and i stopped coming here altogether because i didnt want people to think i was supporting their activities
quoted me cheaper than a big chain and actually charged me that amount
the most recent occasion i made the appointment for noon
they had several and there was always one available when i needed one
not big os fault  they were the messenger
they also did not try to upsell us like the other tire store did trying to tell us we should buy all new tires even though the other 3 tires had plenty of good tread left
she advised us and told us who would be coming
and even though he is a kings fan he is a really cool guy i will deff be coming back here for any and all work i want done in the future
the garlic fried shrimp were incredible as were the beef and chicken potstickers
honestly you might have to go a bit further to pick it up but in the end youll save time without having to deal with the slow idiots behind the counter
i even went inside to complain to the cashier who was extremely nice
there is very little doubt in my mind that the sales people probably knew what the situation was at the time of the sale and that they purposely deceived me
update  without getting into too much detail my car was damaged during the first windshield replacement
took receipts to bmw only repair babbit
just that they said they tested them which is not good practice in my opinion
how many people could or would be affected in this deadly scenario on a daily basis
the salesperson that we dealt with was shelly and she was truly amazing
when i went to return the truck they treated me like trash just about everyone i came into contact with there
i would give 0 if that was a option
if they can take care of this only issue for me then this place will be a 5 star in my book
all this for a simple nail in the tire
i would recommend 6651 customs for any automotive work big or small routine or otherwise
after two months my car started shaking when i braked so i brought it back in
do these 2 always work the same hours
he was helpful in getting my appointment scheduled and kept me updated when the work was being completed
both are american made and employ american people
thanks to hertz roadside assistance for accommodating us regardless of protocol
ryan was the best dealership employee we ever had the pleasure of knowing
during install they noticed a small tear in one of the vinyls i never would have noticed it
very professional and great price for the convenience of them coming to you
but the point of this post is that alltown was professional friendly honest and helpful
dig the gun mags on the coffee table too they were really old but i didnt have time to read anything anyway
they were fast came in at 455ish on a monday they were done at 508 friendly the office girl was polite and efficient and fair no trumped up issues
waited in line for over 15 minutes then the agent didnt even know why it said see desk
ed the used car manager was also very helpful and we appreciate you all
not a pleasant experience
monique included fixing the window in the deal
super nice works and efficient
they did nothing and think that toyota was just trying to get business are you kidding me
friday morning i remembered that i used yelp to find someone to clean my carpet and i instantly started looking for a mobile mechanic
note they are closed on sunday edit ive had the vehicle for over three years now and there have been no significant issues with it
dont let that stop you from bringing your car here very trust worthy place
highly recommend to everyone
were not talking year make model condition here
my attempts to get in touch with the office or after voicemails were not returned corporate meineke to complain were completely ignored
my rental was for a saturday at 1100 am
4 wait time  and finally wait time
id gladly take back my own vehicles or send a friend there
i dropped off my car on monday morning and got the car back at the end of the day on wed  dont leave a message in the voicemail though i got no response when i did that
he dropped everyone off at each terminal quickly
they need to learn how to have better customer service and how to treat women
very large wine list  the montepulciano for 8 was nice
as for the workers some people are nice
i looked up free vacuums on yelp and the closest car wash was here blondies
he said this over and over again
the wheel tech was careful not to damage them or my car very clean and very professional
maybe he didnt look like he had  but thats no reason to treat anyone like that especially if they are interested in a car on your lot
in the s chandler area
great customer service
the appointment scheduler is just an easy way to have your info put in the system but doesnt guarantee your car getting worked on as soon as you get there
i paid 2499 to have spots on my truck and the windows filthy
this company sucks
rich the mgr
they steal from you
after an oil change and service the lower plastic protector beneath the oil pan wasnt correctly attached
i had to be towed there for a broken axle on a sunday
this didnt end up happening but it was very strange toyota was able to set me up with the perfect lease and loan for what i wanted in under two hours
i really appreciate working with someone who cares about his customers
when id  payed 44000 for it
i have had a giant crack across the bottom of my windshield for years and i know that is dangerous and i need to get it fixed but i just havent made the time
i wouldnt recommend this dealer to no one
we request better tires and agreed to a 600 credit towards the tires of our choosing
but our experience with jocelyn briones at autonation east has by far been the best
i do not feel like i am being provided with the service i deserve
thank you joe sirna and the rest of the audi team for all your help in making my purchasing experience amazing
could all use some soap water  a lil elbow grease
they are attempting to make things right by me and we will see how that goes however i cannot as of yet recommend this places sevice department as a reliable place until i see some improvement ill update accordingly
theyve gone from menu service to ordering yourself but they still deliver your order to your table
he said no he remembers thinking it was the head gaskets
also sean is the one who broke my phone and when i had asked him if i could speak to a manager he never once said anything about how he was a manager
i wont be going back to that dealership ever again
if it wasnt for me calling everyday i would have never received my tires after paying for them in full
yes my budget is tiny yes im poor but seriously i deserve respectful service as much as the next man
their 2 year 24000 mile warranty is very impressive and shows confidence in their workmanship
when the window guy is there hes pretty easy to say no thanks to not overly pushy
i take my car in for regular oil change and im always pleased with the customer service
the quality of work is really beginning to show something we did not initially notice
im 55 why the hell should i have to show my card to anyone except a cop
with a small job like bumpers paul will get it done for less than your deductible
the manager jerry told the server he wasnt a manager and they dont have oneessentially lying
its pretty convenient to get in no matter which direction youre traveling
love coming here been faithful getting my cars oil change  i do live in solcal but nothing can compare to the top quality service in az
they detail in and outside of your vehicle
i will even drink them in the winter
i went on the friday before fathers day  i loved it
we were told to stand at door two my husband called to see how long the next one would be  since we saw the shuttle drive off the office said to walk to door 8which we did  walked directly to the shuttle and it pulled away
wished i found them sooner as a business owner i know what it takes to run a business and these guys are great
i will not deal with this shop ever and wont recommend to any of my friends
we all parked in a dirt lot that was full of other cars
they said yes
by the way autozone lost over 125 dollars worth of business on a simple battery swap
affordable friendly and fast
so i brought it back to master entering building one more time
i got my beautiful hyundai from the stouffville location
ive had nothing but positive experiences with autobells until this one
i go here a couple times a week for gas since i live near the gas station and the staff is never friendly nor the staff in the mcdonalds thats connected to it if i didnt have to go here i wouldnt its normally really dirty in there too
mark  linda
ok whatever so a hour and half pass no nothing
we feel that our car is safe and on occasions when i have been traveling alone i feel very secure with the drivers and the way they assist me when i return to claim my vehicle
they have two signs posted oil change 2999
fair prices honesty and great work
when i was finally able to get someone to help me they told me it would be an hour and a half and not the 30 minutes that they guaranteed
no weird people coming up to me when i pump
i wish i could give them 0 stars
i was pleasantly surprised when i was quoted way less than the other two body shops i had visited
i came in last week looking for a specific head unit for my car
i ordered red curry as a substitute
also they tried to tell me the yamaha factory 1200 incentive to buy this old model year bike is partially on them so they factor that in
dishonest dont trust them or go there
ive decided to contact the other location and they took the appointment right away
went in while on a run and asked for a cup for water on a hot morning
92 just for reading check engine light
i love how i was able to eat the shell
2014 ats  the detail tech edgar was also able to resolve an odor in the ac ventilation system that had become nearly unbearable in recent days
i asked her to repeat and she got frustrated with me and was calculating it on the other end but i needed the amounts again to calculate it on my end
also got my vehicle back with various scratches from the sander on the rear quarter panels
i had them done in a glossy black and i was very happy
on a side note i think theyd expend less energy actually doing their jobs and following through than insisting that this is just how it is
i would have rather gone somewhere that charges more but would have delivered better customer service instead of feeling like an unvalued customer and being confronted by the people that work at this shop
do you people think that we are idiots
its hard to find someone like that these daysi will definitely be going over for oil changes and minor repair service
this place has so many authentic northern thai dishes
they have so many complaints that they are hiding them nice business practice midway
i would be slightly wary of this business intentions
this used to be the best of phx but certainly that is not the case anymore
the only place to go
they are sooooo slow
and i dont have to interact with anyonei dont have to smile at the 27 undocumented workers towel drying my car while simultaneously spritzing it with some additional fluids and angling for a bigger tip all the while shouting leassusleassus
they didnt have a ton of business so theres really no reason why the job was so shotty
al condrey was phenomenal he was the first associate on the phone and was waiting for me when i got there
they always do a good job and the customer service is fabulous get it
he was nice and pretty charming
i went there twice and the first time the car sold right before i got there
does not get any more flavorful delicious than this
a very pleasant buying experience
the customer service here is horrible
i was referred here by fellow honda owners and so glad i was
do not go here
i was coming down to visit az when my daughter called actually texted to say her windshield was broken
took my car today and they did everything that needed to be done and i am one happy camper now
the next day it continued to chirp
this has been by far the best car buying experience i have ever encountered
i will definitely be back to purchase from him
turns out i needed new rear rotors but thanks to a coupon on superior tires website i was able to replace both the pads and the rotors for what the dealership wanted to charge me just for the pads
the day after picking them up one of the cars brakes were squeaking horribly
visa is not accepted everywhere thanks to sams club and costco
as a woman i find that taking my car in for any kind of work even a simple oil change is about as fun of an experience as going to the dentist
thought they would help me out with the infiniti
friendly professional quick and reasonably priced
we checked and they said it is okay for there is a paper temp license on the dashboard
horrible experience i called on may 31st at 251 pm very nice lady booked me an appointment for thursday between 8301230pm at 1248 i called and said i have to leave soon no one has showed up they transferred me to the store on cheyenne the lady did not apologize said you dont have an appointment in which i did because i had to got a text confirmation and she said well we cant get their by the time you are leaving i said well can they come to where my appointment is i will be there for a few hours she was not very happy stating if you keep changing ur address we cant guarantee anything
the place is not easy to find
i guess customer service isnt a thing for ramsey and the real miracle is them answering the phone
i have some advice to the lube shops of vegas just change my oil
price was 6000 which seems to be a very good valuethis last time while the service tech was waiting for the repair to dry  harden he washed all of my windows and vacuumed my interior without asking and without me even being present
you wait on homers they do not wait on you
very friendly quick  efficient
no fuss no muss that simple
i negotiated numbers with justin and again had an amazing experience
note they had the van for an entire day but only worked on it between other jobs  this info came from the manager
2 hours for an oil change
literally pulled in without appt was out the door with my flow master super 10 exhaust installed and sounding sweet in less than thirty mins for only 220
there was absolutely nothing wrong with my valve and based on the look on the guys face he knew that it didnt need to be replaced either
between the awesomeness of the car itself and the buying experience i have a new home
their quote came back at just under 700 and the car has run like a dream with just basic maintenance since
it was a total pain in the ass as anyone who has ever tried to take them off knows took forever to get the glue and gunk off the mirror
him opening them as im standing there has no purpose
i went in to get my money back and the cashier had the same guy come over
a mazda 3 2014  beautiful car
the thai tea is a must if you are a fan
in the last 12 months we have had at least 4000 in repairs and its not over
he and his team were great and ill definitely go back
physically inspect in person anything you are thinking of buying from midwest transmission distributors
could we just get some plastic forks
its masquerading as a consumer information site
the fact that the company cares about whats being said on yelp and reaches out to you rates high in my book
more importantly very hard for me to believe they didnt know
your gm is the one that offered me the employee discount which was not a discount at all
hands down this was the best experience at an auto shop since leaving my honest backyard mechanic behind on the east coast
brian is honest straightforward and extremely reliable
weve had the car for one year now and even a year later  received an email from leigh to check in to see if we are happy with our car and to say hello
my mom had a lease with 2 months left
i will come back for all my repairs needs
i said i was taking it to my mechanic because i did not trust him
if you are acquaintances with the owneryoull get moderate service
the only reason i took off one star was that they reclined my passengers side seat to access the filters in front and it moved my very hard to install carseat behind it
i purchased a lexus gx460 a couple of weeks ago with the help of bill skerrett and it was really an amazing experience
i will be returning to them for all of my future glass repair or replacement
it should be noted that i had been taking my car to this dealer for six years and during my last visit was treated as though i had no history of trusting them with my vehicle
i started looking up online reviews of the dealership on my phone and realized this awful customer service wasnt a fluke
what they really mean is they will not accept responsibility for their mistakes
im sorry that i dont remember their names but i recommend this place for any auto services you need
the welds look great the exhaust was tucked up tight it does not vibrate or rattle and care was taken around the starter i can remove the starer with out removing the exhaust and the exhaust is not cooking the starter
do not trust the services at big o tire store 6195 w bell ave
when i refused they magically came back to me with your accessory drive belt needs replacing suspiciously also costing about 200
our family rented jet skis from full throttle powersports
our sales rep was a nice man despite being shy and reserved and unable to answer all of our question
she asked if i could add this review for her not tech savvy  she would like to thank leo pham for his awesome help with getting her new 2017 lexus rx350
all in all it is better than the previous endless purgatory of sms automated replies of this office is at capacity  which translates to we could have used taxdollars to correct this problem by hiring more employees however instead we paid our friends to create this stupid ass system  that was unneeded   and now you get to fuck off since up north we have no queues and now we snort more coke off callgirls with our buddies
he responded quickly set an appointment for the next morning and was in and out when he said he would
i am torn on this review
he said it wasnt really necessary and that i could probably wait another 30k miles
great customer service
as soon as i pulled in a man stuck his head out and asked if we had ordered the kumho tires
i needed to get back to work so i just left
totally hassle free with returns
why would you go anywhere else
when i broke down again last december by uop stadium way way out westi called him again
he searches for the best price parts to save you money on repairs
the price was good for what i got especially considering they actually shampood my seats and didnt just wipe down with a wet rag
only lack a tv in the waiting room
greg is the best
we again declined and he stopped trying to sell the addons to us
i went here today for basic oil change tuneup on my kawasaki vulcan 900 i called and asked if they were busy they said come on down
it takes about 1 hour or so to wash my xc90 but after that the shine and cleaness is amazing
buy a new car and theyll give you free tint free registration free fill tank of gas plus you wont get harassed like you will with friendly ford
we wanted our old car detailed anyway so we ordered the full treatment
thank you liberty ford
they use scare tactics to get you hit spend money on a warranty that covers practically nothing and its still 100 every time you use the warranty not to mention they wont cover your tow or ride to and from the dealership
looks like a real 100 bill
thats pretty damaging to anyone particularly people who are in the process of rebuilding theirs
the atmosphere at mbhenderson is definitely laid back while still giving you the kind of respect and service you would expect from a mercedesbenz dealer
i found this to be unprofessional and ive had so many iffy experiences with this place so it doesnt make me want to go back unless i absolutely have to
also he explained to me that we may luck out and still have some warranty left
always a big line inside but it moves fast they also have a red box outside which is convenient
they have no problem calling you when they want your money the sales guy from findlay was relentless trying to sell me another car with text and phone calls one after another even after i told him im not buying from findlay again after being misled on the warranty and the finance debacle
bought a voucher  for window tinting for two windows from amazon local scheduled an appointment and told him what my car was  nissan versa hb and informed him about the voucher
best to spend my moolah elsewheretired of the attitudes
some finance guy came out to me asking for my pay stubs
the manager stopped by to chat about bbq around the country
so he told me i should get a diagnostic ran to find out what was going on so i did
i dont really have high expectations for a car wash but this place gets the job done for about 20
i can honestly say these are the only guys my mom and i come to for any car problems
we had to pay full price and wait for the manager to talk to beto to verify things
highly recommended frank b stoughtonwi
when i would not they said they are not paying
we had to wait for about 2030 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us and then when they did they gave us the keys to test drive the car alone not telling us a single thing about the car
the cole slaw  potato salad were impressive as well
they boast of an 18 point inspection but skip anything that doesnt make money like vacuuming
bought four brand new tires all covered under warranty in march
i just got a viper alarm installed in my new car from here my sales rep was zachary
so went here for black friday because my brother saw a listing for a lexus he was interested in
im officially a loyal customer
i had installed a full 3 kooks exhaust on my car and i just couldnt get it to fit right
unbelievable service sums up my experience
its better to find a mechanic on yelp thats 5 stars too avoid spending thousands dealing with con artist mechanics
mike was standing outside more interested in a tractor across the street then in answering my questions
these same guys give me the same lip when i bring around my classic unmolested ridemy 1986 honda prelude si
they do have good prices on soda and candy bars so thats a plus since thats mainly what i go there for
they were so helpful
i was wondering why i kept losing coolant
george at az automasters explained to me that my water pump was a little worn but nothing concerning for a 10 yr old car but that because it would be minimal labor to change it out while they were doing the timing belt it would possibly save me future labor costs down the line
its a bit more than im used to spending and what i wanted to spend but this was the first time i put synthetic oil in my car and i know this oil is more expensive because it lasts longer and is better for the engine
they were the most resonably priced what a joke that phrase turned out to be and could have it back to us a few days
poor business practices all around
i got help from this shop back in 82014 and  i had a serious problem with my rack and pinion it had broken completely off from my frame
why bother when there is uber
i was preapproved for auto financing with capital one
dunriteautobody did an amazing job on my car it looks better now then the day i bought it not lying
he asked why i did not return it right away not after 7 days
they also had a small shop convenience store a hawaiian food truck parked outside today saturday and a very busy car wash
if you need a ride dont get it from green cab
we explained that my wife works for hospice of the valley and puts 20k miles a year on her car going to home visits so we were looking for a new reliable vehicle to replace our aging mini
i called my insurance and a few auto glass service spots and shopped around for some quotes
the opposite of satisfaction and joy is what you will get at this business
it has been  in the shop off and on since october
the irony of the situation is we were cash buyers
brian is rude to me on the phone and the first couple years i referred a lot of clients to him but now i realize the products hes selling are junk and from another country
fantastic business practices for customer service
i had the bike fixed at substantial cost to me and told the service writer that they had an opportunity to help me but didnt
i purchased the ultimate car wash there were water spots left on the car as well as sap and bugs
i received a 2015 3 series
i highly recommend them to anyone who takes pride in how good their car looks
but before i left i walked into the autobell and told the manager about the bolt in my tire
no gimmicks didnt give me the run around and allowed me to follow through at my own pace without being pushy
she said my car didnt qualify which was a flat out lie
i recently had my car at this place
good job louts of siam
if you are looking for an easy sale without a pushy sales person who listens trent is the guy for you
very satisfied w my tint
not only that but my husband had to take me to pick it up and he asked if they could fix a scratch on his truck
have used this service close to 10x and theres never a problem
i definitely recommend coming here if your looking for tint at a good price and the work is top notch
worst customer service ever
turns out they ordered and installed the wrong fuse box
he even bore a slight resemblance to mitt romney
they are honest and dependable and wont rip you off
she was so apologetic but it wasnt her screw up to apologize for  she got a new company out within 10 minutes
there are very few times i ever give 5 stars
i kept saying no no no thank you
listen to these two last reviews this guy does not deserve service from anyone
they also failed to put in the air freshener
i had some work done today at this location
the people that are loitering about shopping and behind the register are just wow
i even asked if they would be open in the 4th of july he said yes and that he would  call me to give me an update
my car was in and out in a matter of hours
no recognition from staff that this is an issue
our sales person was ronny and he was really nice to deal with
i leave my phone number and ask that his manger contact metwo days later that did not happen i call and the managerhe tells me to bring the car because one of his mechanics will repair it
in respect to that we will be coming back in about a month or two to buy a full whee and tire package from him
dont believe me
never again will i go to a monro shop
i dont know about most people but to me 5000 is a big mistake
i have owned a car for the last twenty years and that is a first
this couldnt have been a smoother more simple transaction
i cant thank andrew enough today
he even tried selling me another car
when i dropped my car off at 8 am they said it should be ready by 1 pm which was the first sign i had that this wasnt going to be done correctly
thank you everyone at bell lexus
attendants are helpful in case you should have any problems
great dealer and mike the sales manager was awesome
not sure how long its been in there but the tire pressure seems to be fine
ben was so patient and friendly that it made the 8 hours we spent at the dealership looking at cars fly by
im absolutely in love with the car i purchased here
if you require ford or lincoln service regardless where you live at in the las vegas valley you should make him your vehicle service advisor
they took their time to clean and wash my car
it wasnt too much damage but there was a nice dent in the bumper
i cant believe lhm allows them to just throw away good qualified buyers who are serious about making a deal that day
when i asked mike what he would charge me it was only 15
oscar ortiz did an amazing job in a timely manner
young man servicing my vehicle jesus was very nice and respectful
my coworkers use them quite often and love them
i am a previous customer and had nothing but excellent service here
and they didnt seem to have the certified training or good reviews to back it up
that guy never returned so she had to grab another advisor possibly a manager who did help me initially but later passed me off to the guy who had said he didnt have time for me forgot his name
no one ever did
and did i mention weekend traffic sucks especially when youre trying to get back on the highway
going to this dealership was the worst servicerepair experience in my life  service department at this place is crap save your time  money and go somewhere else
im so happy to have found them
it is now 1203pm so how is that 55 minutes
then i received an email
they still havent rectified this so in the future iid rather sit at the dmv for 24 hours than at this fucktard place that screws you out of your money if they mess up your service
scot was up front honest and thorough from the start
i saw some negative reviews about pat the owner
im so happy i did not have the problems that others have described
theyre totally customer oriented on like a hank hill level
i called george the employee i had dealt with and presumable manager at the shop and asked him what would account for the oil being dirty immediately after the oil change
i had zero surprises for them
lastly any time after 12 is a terrible time to get your car washed or detailed
i took my car in to get it washed with a 1 standard service
always pleased with their quality of workwill definitely be using them again and again
when we arrived kims husband was there to greet us and said we would be joined by another couple for our 13pm tour
i have no idea how any person lives or treats their body but how i care for my own body and dont want to get sick or my dog who rides in the backseat and is bound to smell the blood and lick it to get sick
ask again he said itll be a few hours
they promised it just needed some fresh gas and carb cleaner through it
thanks for the awesome job
ive never had any issues even though they valet your car and hold onto your keys
they also offer free oil change or 10 off when you write a yelp review and its good for use that same day   even though i came out paying for more than i was expecting i am satisfied with the customer service the prices and the short wait time
i asked for high kbb value on the truck and they gave it to me
last week i was in the unfortunate circumstance of being involved in a fender bender and my insurance company referred me to 911 collision center
i completely trust them and so thankful my brother found these guys
the problem was i realized when i got home that they didnt  put the lock nut key back in the car
i drop it off and they assure me theyll have it done by a predetermined time
well i wasnt going to let this paper boy wantabe drive my car so i had to jockey it around and pull back into the line labeled oil change
when he found a potential problem unrelated to the work i had them doing he gave me a call and let me know about it instead of just doing the work and charging me for it
super job and i am very picky  only place i have ever been where i did not have to rewipe the wheels down myself
the service department really needs to get their act together because how they treat customers is awful
they definitely didnt have that ostentatious swagger that you often find at luxury dealerships and that appealed to me
fixing my car was not a priority to them but trying to overcharge me was
the check engine light went on in my jeep and after taking it to autozone to have the code read they told me there was a problem with my transmission
i visited a couple other brands that day and had zero issues being shown cars without any commitment including findlay honda
bret glass found exactly the 2017 gmc yukon xl denali my wife and i had been searching forover 4 months  is a very gmc knowledgeable low pressure genuinely good sales personemphasis on person not the sales
a massive cluster whoops
i soon started to see why she liked dutch so much  instead of confusing me with technical jargon or giving me choices without any context dutch took his time to explain what was happening with my vehicle what my choices were the impacts and his own recommendation
i will definitely be coming back here for my next oil change or any other auto needs
i told the mechanic that two other shops didnt want to fix it and he said that dont scare me none
paul and the guys will do an outstanding job
they answered all of our questions and didnt rush us at all
i left their sales department a loud angry voicemail and sent them a note through their website
overall  a great experience that will have me coming back
dont even get a car cleaned after 4 days of working on it
this nitwit is trying to keep a job at everybodys expense
he was verbally abusive again
in the past ive had to repeatedly ask to see it in person and when i did see the true costco offer i caught that theyre lying about the price
they sold me a car they did not have legal possession of
they boy stated that he only had 50 cents
so another day trying to manage family life without a car
rather we were treated with respect and it was a great experience from beginning to end
never again with such quick service
my sales rep at the time of purchase was eric steffes and he promised everything and had great attitude and was great to work with
i didnt even wait to get the appraisal because i was so upset by the way she and her so called manager treated me
i was trying to find a good deal on getting my brakes done
they could have overcharged me or done work that was not necessary but there was none of that
after a horrific experience at the pep boys on jonesi came to this awesome store and was treated like a human with a brain they couldnt have been nicer efficient and dedicated to find the problem and fix it quick with a smile
i brought it to south end imports to have the repair done as the other shop did not work on vws
so of course you want your car done by a woman owned company
when i took my daughters 4runner in i didnt have much hope because when we bought it used the paint was gone
i get it was a basic oil change
he actually changed my opinion on car dealers and dealerships
what a joke
beware once you buy from them you are of no concern anymore the problem unfortunately did not get fixed and these people need to find another industry to be in if they wish to treat people that way
we actually negotiated the rest of the deal over text message and landed on 23500 otd
as priceless as finding a great hairdresser
he just opened the hood and looked around for about 3 minutes and then told me that nothing appeared wrong but would have to hook up a computer to it to find the problem and that would cost me 125
dale is a class act guy and very professional
a new radiator costs 15000 tops
one of the things i love about the s1000rr is the security features my bike came with an alarm system which was a plus but my primary focus was all the electronic components are vin coded to that specific bike so they cannot be stolen and used on another bike
if i could give them a lower score i would
took my jeep in a few months ago for the free oil change and tire rotation
it seems like these guys are either really good or really bad with their work
and when i left and item in the van they found it and returned it
next time we will just take the meat to go and cook our own sides at home
dealerships want the least amount of work and cost involved for them when doing repairs so its easy to blame the driver for something they should have made sure was in good condition before allowing it to be sold on the floor
the manager came in to continue to argue with me that they were not going to fix what i asked them to fix and that they were going to fix everything they wanted
10 minutes and he said that they didnt have any room to get me in
after a bad experience with the toyota dealership on west sahara i went to centennial toyota to purchase a new car during one of their incentives
last place had my car 4 days
my tire was flat on a sunday and of course everything was closed except tire works
if the preexisting chip was significant enough to cause such a crack from a simple temperaturepressure change i feel they really should have detected it during this stage if they were doing a proper inspection
by the time youre about to order folks are making snide remarks at each other and kids are getting in trouble from boredom
they do take a while to get the car washed but its quality
i usually am not to kind to salesman because of their reputation
so i think ill take it back to them to have the ac controls checked out
moshe was very professional and was able to repay all three locks as well as make an adjustment on one door to insure everything worked properly
awful service attitude and no managerial responsibility
it took about two hours for everything from the moment i walked in until the moment i walked out
great professionalism knowledge and kindness
most every california safeway has gone through this transformation
my cab didnt call when it arrived
great paint job and the color matches perfectly i really recommend them
they took what i started put wheels under it
till i find cp auto on yelp
so i yelpd auto glass replacement and blue chip came up with a full five stars
just good peeps doing good wrenching
on the way our check engine light came on and we figured our passat may not make it back home at the end of the weekend if we didnt have it checked out
especially the inside that had been totting toddlers around
they you would sell you up for things you dont need
after one of the other employees was very kind to us and gave us every detail we were looking for
i have to say this has been the best service experience ive ever had
five stars without a doubt
obviously an oil change is not a great litmus test to determine the mettle of a shop
discount not only had them in stock they charged me hundreds less than im used to paying
they remember my old blue truck also
carter was prompt precise and personable
trust these guys to get the job done right
i searched yelp and saw positive reviews for this place
its hard to hate on costco
he seemed like a nice guy
kyle says  oh thats an error
i take both of my vehicles to autocrafters for service from new tires to major repairs
after six years i now have to ask myself why do i keep going back
i recently moved to this area and this is the only super close gas staton
one owner ss impala
they need more of him around for sure
i left several text messages and voicemails and receive no response back
i can now begin to trust the auto service industry again knowing bogi  team are looking out for me and my cars best interest
he fixed my car and did a very nice job i work very far from home so not having a car was a no no
my interior wasnt wiped down at all and i paid 1799 for this car carwash
scratched the side of my car and poped up the siding
i really cant rave about it enough
the staff at this pep boys location is a professional caring team they all do what ever it takes to make the car repair a pleasant experience
if i could give negative stars i would
fortunately they have a couple decent seating areas and i must confess i thought it to be slightly weird to see so many people sitting in comfy lounge chairs just quietly staring all in one direction out at the cars as they got finished up almost as if it was a theatrical presentation
after comparing unitys service on a pure applestoapples basis i estimate that i saved over 1000 by using unity
i eat thai food a lot and no joke this is by far the best ever
it was your mistake something shady seems to be going on
not only was the outcome outstanding but he even came to my house and fixed it in my garage
i trained myself to work on my own cars so i would never have to deal will shops again
i put 3500 down and they sold me a car
after looking at 7 different dealerships and searching for a great suv at a reasonable price i went to subaru montreal
i understand working at a busy establishment can be frustrating but a good attitude can go a long way
had hail and fenderbender damage on our honda pilot repaired here
they do quality work at a very reasonable price
so i call these guys back up and at first no one knows what the heck im talking about even though they seem to love google which is exactly where i found this procedure
the owner said no with such a rude attitude completely unprovoked
we have checked several times to make sure the air pressure was good but it continued to come on
they were fast professional and they bent over backwards to make sure i had a great customer experience and that the repairs were done correctly
extremely disappointed with my experience here
they got me in and got me out as quickly as they can
service was fast decor was unpretentious but the area was a little sketchy
they did tell me how long the wait would be before we started the process so that i could decide if i wanted to wait that long another plus
they gave me an estimate 150 cheaper than 2 other shops and the final bill was 50 cheaper than the estimate
the sales staff there were more then helpful and molded our loan exactly how we wanted it to get us out the door with a new vehicle
its excellent awd in the snow and this southern gal loves the way the car handles  much better choice than the optima which is sporty but doesnt do well in the snow
its the full service car wash you know you are going to do battle with the sales guy er wash consultant when you pull up
john ended up driving me to the local shop around the corner so i could get my battery tested waited with me then brought me back with my new battery and helped install it
staff was friendly and efficient
my new used civic is purring and ready for a lot more milesthanks guys
so you can do a shoddy job to make up the coupon price
employers and owner always go out of their way to be helpful and nice
even put back my aaa sticker and frequent car wash sticker
i didnt touch it for 24 hours then washed it
no high pressure
the worker whom i had first dealt with in the morning said we called the mechanic to come and explain
my experience at porsche of beachwood with tiffany greg and steve was simply outstanding
i would recommend him and big two to all of my friends
courteous shuttle driver
fr mich ist das thema mr wash somit erledigt
worse experience i had had in a long time at a car wash put my car in at 0730am at location on 8369 w bell rd they only have 2 people washing the car with a long line of car waiting
dont ask them to call you
we have a positive experience
been here many tea lots of employees but i am never greeted or asked if i need any help finding anything
i would definitely recommend people use this dealership
well it was dark on the passenger floor and i didnt notice until a few days later that my air filter cover and a screwdriver were on the floor
he just demanded we leave and told us we were trying to scam them and why would he go for that deal
i was later handed the phone to place a claim with my insurance company
i called many different times to speak to the guy in finance i have been working with
da ist noch verbesserungsbedarf
luckily my friend who used to work for an insurance company warned me and told me that is a scam and that i would later get billed by my insurance company and this would be treated as a claim
these two men could not have made me feel more comfortable or cared for
discount tires claims department does not want to pay for the damages they caused
come on man
my car is the only car here and they have about 45 mechanics
they tell me it was theyre mistake and theyll fix it but i should consider sticking with the color because it was the original color and would retain the cars value
if you want your car completely detailedcleaned on the interior go to a more pricey place that specializes in auto detail
very nice lady honest and not just there to sell you a car but will definitely make sure customer is happy and satisfied
i will probably not return there even though i have the life alignment program
but full disclosure i came in for a minor issue not tire repair which is supposed to be their forte
they used a cheep aftermarket blower that was noisy
thanks again guys
as a female who takes care of all the repairs on her car i know that they are upfront and honest as to what needs to be done
they came out showed me the invoice my trade value and  everything that was being considered in the total price which was not that far off what i was looking for
i will not be using  zappys detailing services again
he didnt pressure me at all
great customer service
highly recommend and very affordable and the quality is top rated
the person who answered the phone was courteous and efficient
a few weeks ago i took it back for another oil change with information from my uncle as to what was going on with my power steering that i was having difficulties with
they gave a whopping 578 credit off the price of the rental
bob quickly took care of me and my tire
my van blew a tire on a desserted stretch of the 303 between lake pleasant pkwy and the i17
i drove from north las vegas to henderson and still no cold air
he made the entire experience enjoyable he was very kind and made my tradein and new car purchase the best it could possibly be
the staff is always friendly patient and willing to work with you
i literally go out of my way to come to this specific station and have been doing so for the past nine months because of how good it is
a half star would be more appropriate
this was our second time getting a car tinted there
just prepare to overpay for terrible work
once we got home i got out of the car and it took me about two seconds to notice what went wrong
just a wonderful experience from start to finish
i would have given this review 5 stars if the sears policies were completely hassle free
they took care of my jeep just right
i got the impression they want to pump out numbers at the expense of the customers
they also told me they left a message on my phone with a possible solution
we took it to our local honda dealer and they found a screw plug that was so loose it almost fell out
i had to call the company 3 times to figure out where the driver was lost it turns out he apologized but had several reasons for being late
i dont know how many times ive needed something basic and they are out of stock
marlene and chris and everyone else make this a wonderful experience
john checked further and admitted that hed screwed up it wasnt ready
after being super mad at mazda usa for my steering wheel the leather was peeling mike d came to the rescue and was able to get mazda to replace it for free
so they did my brakes wrong putting my life at risk
this is a great place for car service
we brought it to service and the gentleman justin connell brushed me off saying its not supposed to he advised me that no vehicles do that and that the heat only blows up warmhot air to the front row
took my 2009 kia spectra5 to the kia dealership twice for the same problem down in henderson and they werent able to find anything so i brought my kia here to findlay kia
who knows if they would have called or not
they really ripped her off with unbelievable high charges of over 600
it was a really good deal
i would come back
during our drive my wife was going through the paperwork in the folder and noticed a card that showeda 2200 upgrade fee
need to stay longer next time and have a bite to eat
we finally closed on a ford explorer last week though
first the test drive was amazing because dave let me test the luxury vehicles i wanted with no pushy salesman talk or hassle
after such great service we tipped him very generously and told him to go home and enjoy the night with his wife
their car wash is lack of detailing and very expensive when compared to the service what they give
