everytime i would bake something one side would be more done then the other
the front facing camera is obstructed by the screen which is not even glued down all the way
this guy was super excited to help sat down with me  helped me find what i wanted  designed what we couldnt find
way too many temptations here for me to deal with
and best of all free wifi
this is definitely an environment for toddlers and the toys get changed out frequently so my daughter never gets bored
the next day i called him and told him what was going on with my phone
dont even bother wasting your time or moneya guy for our central vac decided to come to our home without even calling or setting up a time
some unclean words were spoken
the service response was quick and everything arrived as planned
thank you for your hard work
should not rate their price range as inexpensive
i especially like that the owners try to learn everyones name
they were pretty quick and very courteous the entire time
with rave reviews on the internet i thought they would do a good job
reliable reasonable and just really lovely service
one of the pieces was a pearl bracelet that had broken and they had the repairs done
words cannot express how happy i was with their job
we have been using bulwark for a long time and have been very happy with the service we receive
i tried these guys for several months
if like us your ac is broken in the middle of summer and you are looking for the parts now and relatively cheap apc is the place for you
above par carpet is by far as good as it gets

he basically verbally assaulted a woman he was helping in response to questions she was asking
my phone was totally done
my husband had zerorez come out while i was out of town
im a little upset that ive waited almost 1 week for this estimate
to my shock the earliest cleaning time was 3 weeks away and it was for a single cleaner who supposedly needed 65 hours for my 2000 sq ft house
not pushy and over bearing but not none existent
darnell and josh did a fantastic job
i suspect that they never replaced the clutch assembly when we brought it in and they only replaced the belt
super sehenswrdigkeit und erlebnissttte
ive never had a problem with any of the replacement screens or devices after their repair
two of which must be the other 5star reviews about this establishment
they called me back to say it was ready
all other companies come with deodorizer

i personally have been extremely please with all my orders through impressive threads and recommend this business
my bride to be and could not be happier
plain and simple
theyre just the best
they even have vinyl planking in thier office
the women who work here are super nice
scheduled the next time no one showed up and 20 minutes before the end of the 2 hour window i got a call that the tech called in sick
i had the same horrible experience
while i realized the dress was way too big i didnt realize that this was probably a mistake on the company who provided me the dress
i could write a novel on how amazing she is and her little shop
thats when everything went downhill
this store is really accommodating
i payed 110 for two hours which is their minimum i believe
mint carpet cleaning did an amazing job on my home
i was horrified and thought there was no way this disaster could be fixed
he was done around 1045  i was very impressed at their speed of their response the quality of service and the prices
great prices and the onsite manager myrtis is amazing
she even popped outfiled down the rough corner where my ipad hit the floor which i didnt even know was there
the repairs have been mostly to my grandmothers pins rings and necklaces and they have the right crew of repair people
i had them write down the prices of their services which included shoes and pants and then when i came to pick it up prices went up
i should have listened to my instincts when they initially called to schedule
it doesnt get squeaky cleaner than this
when you walk in youre shuffled between 2 rows of bikes which is the majority of this stores inventory
working in the evenings cons very poor quality cleaning of laundered garments terrible pressing and folding of dress shirts overpriced only game in town if youre inside talking with the customer service and someone drives up they drop everything and ignore you mid question some staff are downright unfriendly not open very late give discounts if you post a yelp or facebook review that seems against the rules so compared to other cities ive lived in this place is terrible
very up front with all charges and fees

i talked to ben at turbo clean and had them do our downstairs carpet
at 330pm that same day they called me to come pick up the computer with a brand new hair drive the new os installed and all of my files recovered and transferred on to the new hard drive for a great price

they were very professional service was great wait time was fair
they did a great job cleaning the grout
there are much nicer reps at the downtown summerlin store
thank you gustavo
manager was at the back of the store and refused to give me a refund because he stated i passed my 14day return
very happy overall and will recommend them to everyone
your dry cleaning is always ready for pu when they say it will be  if by any chance something isnt exactly as u requested ex you want your slacks to hv a harder crease

i found judys about 6 months agoi was searching for a good alteration business to bring my clothes tooi have been to others but never really satisfied with the quality of workjudys work is outstanding and i have used them several times in the last 6 monthsthe normal wait appears to be a week but very well worth the waitgreat service
great vibe here the place is pretty small so dont expect to find every book you might be looking for
since i have had numerous calls and voicemail from sean never the owner saying they have fixed it to the best they know how and if i wanted to buy the buckles they would put them on for free or give me a 15 cleaning credit
handled two drains two leaky faucets and fixed my toilet
prompt arrival and professional
and having to fill out application take written and driving test took only about 45 min
month after month i went back and was given one excuse after another
i had pointed out specific areas when i dropped it off so i thought they would be addressed
the movers  staff were super friendly and helpful during the process
i will definitely use this company again
not worth it
they have a dropoff service for 99c a pound if you want to not even deal with washing yourself
if they are so incompetent and sloppy with calls and promises i can imagine what can happen when i deal in person
they place the burden of securing any type of recourse on you as a customer
maybe it stands for sublime among shitty
hard working and good guys
in the end the amp tech is out of now gone until after i need it back
wa took the time to sandblast it all down and polish it up to a beauty
great to work with
our front office couch smelled so bad from customer use and he was able to make our couch fresh again

he said he would charge 15
after i posted the review rob text me that he was in a car accident and in the hospital so thats why he never made it to my appointment
it got little airtime on television most of golfs big names didnt bother showing up partly because the purse was so small  the viewing angles for spectators were limited to whatever hillside you could plant yourself down on at the tpc scottsdale stadium golf course
i received a response some  days later with an email that read please email this address
the packers were amazing and nothing was broken
one thing that always struck me about spritz is the lack of patrons
the old lied childrens museum has found a new home near the smiths center and brought with it brand new exhibits
as well as being a worthwhile cause oxfam has become a gem for 2nd hand designer gear books and retro shoes which can be grabbed at a smidgen of the original price

when it was my turn they couldnt find the email that i had sent to that location
i had horribly bad experiences in the past around the phoenix area i am glad to know i have found a company i can trust  i dont have to even try to shop around for a better deal
completely incompetent and unprofessional service
the owner rick is honest and true to his word
now at 8501 perry highway
totally worth the 1 a gallon
he did a nice job and they were done on time
printing solutions is one awesome printer
her interpersonal skills are at best rough and at worst abrasive and dictatorial

regardless the food was good and reasonably priced not to mention the restaurant is a nonprofit which is pretty cool so i will definitely return
they come to our house and our condo every month
i was a little disappointed in how clean my carpets were after using barefoot organic
thanks for your help and honesty
i then requested the boning be taken out and she wanted to charge me 35 more which is ridiculous seeing as it was their mistake
he determined parts needed to be ordered and filed the request with hsa
his service and knowledge made the whole transaction smooth and painless
when he left i understood the problem his solution and what i needed to do going forward that will help to keep our drains running freely
for the excellent customer service and the profession carpet installation
the gift shop is also worth checking out and there is a small area for a rotating art exhibit
i was charged 75 for everything
i also want to comment to the owner of this company for the staffs who work hard with strong chemicals
about 730am on sat morning no call back so i call again at the request from my wife and he answers
after actually writing this review though i have actually convinced myself that they just missed some spots i was very closely observing and did an overall ok job
and then i was able to freely roam around montreal with my iphone and use it to discover all the splendid little hidden places this amazing city has to offer ie i went to the library to study for a midterm
called them to clean my carpets for a move out
just a great all round boot shop thats been doing the same thing right for a very long time

they now have tarps for shade which really helps prolong my visit
they were amazing and went above and beyond
he was a good driver and even gave me some spring training info
i left without buying any of my items
this is a little overdue and i dont often leave reviews but it is a must for fit for a bride
they inserted boning which was completely unnecessary and only ruined the dress because it then made it gap
featuring various folks on bikes its a silent homage to bikers
in a nutshell if you dont have deadlines and dont give a damn about what you are taking in go for it
be careful
after the attempt to clean my couch he called his boss on speaker phone to explain why it couldnt be done
see my other yelp review i had to go back to bulwark
i had some items to be scanned and she said i should just drop them off
i would definitely recommend him
really happy with their service and will be a long term customer
i spent an hour chatting with the owner russ last time i was there
they cleaned my tile grout and it looks brand new
i switched to mint locker out of convenience and quality
i just called the number

instead i dont trust this establishment they made their problem the coupon a problem for me the customer

she is hard to communicate with  didnt like where i parked so she was not going to serve me
however in the last year the have upped their prices a bit because they got a new credit card machine and now they charge for all sorts of taxes
the owner was the guy who did the service and he was very professional and did a great jobthe carpets look brand new
it wasnt that busy in the restaurant but the took forever
another great service
it is no surprise that when picking my cat up they didnt take care of contacting the rescue for payment and wouldnt release my cat until i paid
maybe im overlooking it but i dont see it
the theory of onsite childcare is a good one and the reason we chose red rock vs staying on the strip but it didnt work out for us
big industrial washers that really do clean your clothes and indeed use less soap per load
quick response to email fast worker on time and honest

had we stayed in gilbert we would definitely work with this company again
they had a repairman come out promptly arrived on time finished within an hour and his service call was under 100 he knew his stuff
i wanted to leave a review because i know its really hard to trust a company with repairs on technology so i wanted to give a shout out and let other people know this place is reliable
when looking a jeweler one seeks integrity and creativity while also keeping in mind the obviousquality and costs

i dont think it ever worked properly
really impressed with blake his helpful advice and effort to keep the house clean while he worked and as he prepared to leave

on top of being ridiculously over priced the man who ran the counter was loud and rude and arrogant

the total coming to way more than the agreed price
the white shirt i told them to trash is pristine and crisp bright white and shiny like the moon
changes in pricing
great family owned business
keep in mind its christmas time and i need to be out of my apartment the day i requested

i am very impressed with this company and will continue to use them
we opted for the annual family membership which i found with several visits paid for itself and was well worth it

the best part is that their fees are very reasonable  far less than i have ever quoted my clients for the same service so i am able to give my clients a discount they get a better quality of service and i am able to make a respectable profit without the hassle
they charged us to replace the stone even though we had the protection plan
seeing other reviews say that they were treated badly really confuses me

this review is more about the service than the quality of the cleaning service

the store was clean and had just about everything a person could want to make a move so smooth
the guys wrapped all furniture to ensure safe delivery and worked at a quick pace
the ability to interpret what a client is relaying and translate that into a final product that goes so far beyond satisfaction is not just a skill or a talent its a gift
he sprayed the area well  even sprayed the black widow
moving into my new home i wanted to be sure the job was handled in the right way rather than it being a superficial cleaning

there are horses cows goats llamas rabbits cats chickens and more peacocks than i have ever seen in one place

this small business deserves your patronage
installed new air conditioners an year ago
also their extended warranties wont do you much good which is why i dont bother buying them
we just stopped by here because we just needed to print up a document to get notarized at the wells fargo across the street

he didnt know where to touch where to start how to use the tools this guy yelled at me and my daughter
there are no rough edges to catch on the yarn in our knitting but it has the rawedge bark look
they come right to your home or work
ill admit that i went back to my car and burst into tears
add to that the appliances sold from here are unreliable to point that the first thing a repair tech will ask is if you bought it from here
always go to a jeweler
could this place get any more crowded

this job exceeded my hopes for the future of me and my chair
i was not disappointed
charlie and shane were fantastic
the way the bbq both looked and performed exceeded all of my expectations
i hope they all go straight to hell

exceptional service and quality
director is rude
i think he was insinuating a good yelp review but being honest i gave him 40 and decided to write how i really feel
however for every julie ive encountered at this location there have been 23 sales people who have been well aware that apple has the power and the typical appleeyed customer has learned to be grateful with whatever service they can get
i was shocked how great they looked
i have always known his pricing to be fair one reason which led me to him and his service to be fast the second reason
i called around and this guy actually picked up on a sunday to help me out with my infested computer which i needed antivirus removal run on

hmm what could it be as i only filed 1 claim and that was for a clogged pipe that would have been cheaper on my own
really great service and really good prices
i recommend insectek for your pest control needs
he takes great pride in his work
i brought in my kitkat clock and they got it running again
it is merely a buzz word for the latest trend that has a short life span
the owner also said the door handles are a hard area to dip and it doesnt last as long as wheels do
so i dillydallied until monday 4 days before the wedding and went to alterations express
i have an appointment and there is someone else there to help customers and its not even busy
support your local small business  go see bernie for all of your tailoring needs
then i asked for at least 20 he said i need to pay 10 bucks extra to get that absurdddd
and for being a man of your word
word of advice if you decide that some jewelry you own is no longer your thing sell it on ebay
not that they will answer the phone or anything
i hope cassandra gets a raise when her manager see this
zach is awesome
not only do they have the most amazing selection of bbq rubs sauces tools grills and smokers but the staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help in any way
dont wait until the last minute to get things done and dont be that jackass who holds up the rest of the patrons who have their stuff together
spent the better part of an hour looking to no avail
which was awesome
in response to an emergency situation due to a leak i had the pleasure of working with justin a of specialty cleaning services today
i do not recommend this business
the model we wanted did come in a package deal but this location was out of them
thats all well and good and would warrant a 4 star but the 5 star treatment came from matthew taking the extra time to answer my stupid questions about my icloud and iphone at the counter for free
so what is the point of a policy that is 12 applicable
i would switch but the competitor in town is just as bad
i was disgusted
the technician is extremely disappointed with our decision to not go forward and we wonder why he did that
the shop is conveniently located on fort apache in the hobby lobby parking lot
see for yourself httpswwwfacebookcomlaurelwilliams79  this company is very fishy
hands down come to this shop
the old owner made it more feel like you were going to her home
two nails were nailed half way into the top where there were never any nails before
we cannot thank the entire team enough for what they did and how well they did it
they have an outside fill system which can be 15 gallons of which 5 gallons 125 or take all your bottles inside and there 45 refill stands will hydrate your bottles quickly
they came out to do our carpet cleaning last week
they clean a small area with the expensive stuff and then call the office to get a special price
call the night before i needed servicehe was willing  to come over right away but was working and couldnt have him come that day
if you are assigned ish as your tech request someone else
i met with a friendly hispanic woman  i dont remember her name
you immediately see the wonderful landscaping that sets the tone for the rest of the cemetery that you are about to see
i highly recommend this location
we had a few other quotes and they where 300400 dollars more than invader
and i am talking about soho which is not a cheap neighborhood to live in
our icemaker stopped working two months ago so i called to have them look at it
mr carusos suit is beautiful fits like a glove and all of the details are perfectly done ie
she does a great job and is very trustworthy
the woman in the morning sorry i cant remember her name is very pleasant and very attentive to details even to the point where she reminded me to check for my collar stays  although she would have removed them and put them in a bag for me she said if i had not removed them
they were extremely adamant about explaining my fault in the matter and continued to repeat that to me with complete disregard to my specific questions on how to resolve it
the guys were professional and patrick was kind and informative
a day later they realized my battery wouldnt charge peter told me it would be cheaper if i got a newer refurbished airbook
no updates were given about my belongings or when exactly they would be arriving in il
the owner explained everything to us and was quite friendly
on night schedule we would pick my girls up and at times they would be the only ones left 4560 mins before close times
next they will do my upstairs
glad i called these guys very thorough on their cleaning process
after taking the time to drive around the southside to find parking and then waiting in line to pick up my order i was disappointed to see that they had printed off the original proof and on some sort of giant flimsy postcard with the invitation on one side and the addresses on the other  not sure how they thought that made sense and especially when my email clearly talked about printing envelopes etc
its a horrible feeling i am sure all mothers can relate to to entrust the love care and attention to your child while youre away at work to a caregiver
i would like to add this to my review that i did receive a call from the manager at western exterminators
im pretty sure my messenger bag is ruined from it
a few times i came here i have pre paid packages that just needed to be sent out and the line would be so long with maybe 2 employees ringing customers up
no ones perfect thats business but these guys are fast reasonable they know their stuff and you cant put a price tag on that
of course edinburgh locals will be familiar with david hume
the prices here are a complete ripoff
the dowd ymca is the big daddy of charlotte gyms
i got my cards shipped 3 days later and i love them
i felt like my iq dropped 20 points when i went in there
the owner took responsibility  for his employee cheating me like that and ordered an immediate fix
would highly recommend
i needed flexibility and brent made that happen
so the fact that they are going to try to squeeze another 170 out of me after spending nearly 600 on the phone just a few months ago is absolutely ridiculous
just received a fresh taper fade from josh at a cut above barbershop
there were several times i may have wanted an alteration tweaked after it was done my fault and wayne made it right at no extra charge
he was at my home 30 minutes
also as my business has grown i realize how important it is to have a good relationship with a conveniently located mail store
lock my keys in my car recently  just before about to leave vegas to la i was rushing
i made the right choice by going to see van
replacing and matching it wont be easy
leaving me very little choice i had to pay the difference to have the rest of the grout cleaned
salt river keepin it real dumpy
he immediately answered my call
i was visiting friends who wanted to play bingo at the red rock casino
hundreds of dead crickets were the result of the respray  but not a scorpion or spider corpse to be found
the paths in the cemetery are paved so a lot of joggers rollerbladers and cyclist come here to get their groove on
family music is awesome
great fast friendly service
most places dont give you this kind of customer service anywhere
sarafin was an absolute sweetheart
i was very happy to see that the fit was now perfect after their alteration
the staff were very gracious and accommodating when i said we had to pull her out
you would have thought she saw a ghost
i purchased a pair of capri type bike pants that go over my knee on 103113
the second time cast iron pipe carrying sewage from the house had broken under the bathroom floor from the toilet to the sewer connection at the house
we have been on tastings at wineries in france new zealand etc and there is something very different about this wine compared to everything else and not in a good way
mike does some amazing work
the cost was pricey in my opinion though there certainly was a lot of surface area to clean
no dont worry about the dust on the floor i will take care of it
he did his best to save me money
finally about 25 hours after weve dropped off the phone they finally call to say its ready
he gave me a list of procedures to do before he sprayed so everything would be sprayed in the best possible way
staff is not fully trained
he was so patient and very thorough
this is now my go to tux rental  store
cant say anything about the quality of their actual work because i never experienced it but their attention to customers and ability to be organized enough to make an appointment is pathetic
they troubleshoot and determined a new grounding rod should be sunk to repair it
i brought him 4 dress that ive had for years and i wanted to alter them
my home office window looks out to the street
the rest was not real silver or other jewelry
went to make bulk mail deposit today
they were fast professional and very reasonably priced
they did not rush and seemed to take extra time and attention to get the job done right i have 3 little kids so the couch and carpets were pretty nasty
i had some restitching done and it looks like a 5 year old did it
i feel so fortunate to have found ms louiza and look forward to both of my daughters attending school here until kindergarten
this time the seat was really baggy and i needed it taken in a bit
this location lacks customer service in any form
when i called barlow back they refused to reschedule delivery for same day or the next
i would advisesuggest you check the connections before they leave or before you attempt to do laundry
sometimes the liquids are made right sometimes they are not and seem unflavored
tours start at 10a and leave every 15 minutes till 1130a
i was planning on having our fridge out of commission until tuesday at the earliest and instead we have it working early on saturday evening
i came to veras after a friend highly recommended the place and the great experience she had there
i appreciate how they wrap the furniture prior to loading and also strap it down inside the truck
the only thing i was concerned about was that they had a small little terrier in there when i went not sure if it was theirs or their customers but it wasnt there when i went back but luckily i didnt have dog hair on my stuff
i havent been to many thrift stores but this one is definitely a favourite
it still wouldnt cut the hair on my arm
first the crew arrived 2 hours late which resulted in the last 90 minutes of the unload happening virtually in the dark of night
friendly clean on time and saved me money
i too have lost several hundred family slides due to this business closing
anyways i had to get a 10 foot uhaul for my move from chandler to mesa
these guys are great and super helpful
i took it to the shop and they tested it and showed that the battery was not very strong
interesting since that was their solution when i first pointed out the shrinkage
the water is light airy and wet
keep your things safe and store them elsewhere
due to us not feeling we were being sold on anything and feeling we could trust scott we decided to go with his company
i run my business the way i want to run it
i hope that was a good thing lol  the doctor was very nice
stop begging for the reviews it almost made me not want to write this one
she made the work i was doing a lot easier and went above any expectations i had
stop being so hoity toity and take care of the customers
it was just an afternoon of going through horror stories of these poor people who paid money and put their trust in these companies who did not come through and send the right flowers at the right time etc
2 stars for the quality of repair and level of customer service
i got it for roughly a third of the new price
however if oneguard takes these impressive steps to treat their customers right then heck i might sign up for another year
same story and was told they would call me
i wasnt exactly sure which bike i wanted  and the owner let me test ride one in the parking lot to see how i liked it
it would be interesting if there was a company that was completely upfront about all the fees out the door
extremely convenient ability to schedule delivery and pick up of your boxes as well as delivery of specific boxes rather than all at once cheaper than a full storage locker and responsive customer service
they showed up on time were very pleasant and very fast
my belongings were not damaged as well
if you need a tailor i highly recommend these wonderful ladies
jeans were about 1015pair to have them shortened same with my yoga pants
this place feels like home
great service very fair pricing and wonderful people
i dont have high expectations just do what you say you are going to do when you say you are going to do itpretty simpleif i wanted aggravation i would of moved the stuff myself
i contacted her today and said well maybe wed
i called on a thursday and the first opening they had was the following tuesday
four items four fairly technical items forty bucks
apparently this company has a very nasty habit of verbally guaranteeing things and then later hiding behind contracts and paperwork
i had a few dresses that were way too long and dragged on the floorwhich never happens since i am 59
we had ants appear inside in between our scheduled service calls and he happily returned to take care of the problem at no charge
ive only been here for shows having been to many a punk show here in my high school existence
fan doctor got me scheduled
i finally spoke to the person and asked her to remove me from all their marketing lists
they pull their rates out of a hat because you of course always have the most expensive repair need
they even did alterations on my work uniform and i was pleased
would highly recommend using them
i also bought a  lot of books from them for like 20 bucks cause no one  was bidding on the books
i found a station pressed for help and proceeded to play on my iphone as i waited for help
we were with tutor time before for 6 months cuz its closer to work
very bossy and difficult
but it is nice to know in emergencies i can get same day
who was an older heavyset man i see him in there ocassionally
duh my bad
this place is a perfect example of how 1 employed can give a company a bad name
they overcharge but at least had the courtesy to find the 25 off coupon
i highly recommend him   thanks frank
that bizarre statement  is almost certainly impossible to be true setting aside the rude manner in which that verbal tripe was delivered
still didnt have the correct parts to finish the job
it was an amazing watch
the units and grounds were well maintained
back for a redo
after cremation she is back with us
the fries are made with real potatoes and taste so fresh
i called and needed to get my lcd screen fixed
i had a lot of deluxe sample  sizes of body washshampoorazorslotion etc
no pressure to buy more bike than i needed
omg i ended up out of the park into private properties
donation the actual needle in your arm takes about 15 minutes
dont hesitate to use them for any upholstery needs
third i ordered two sets of business cards and specifically requested they be separated into two invoices as i placed orders for two businesses i run
the most recent appointment was for a moveout clean and boy the house sparkled
so im finding a new cleaner even if the drive is further
affordable and honest
when i ask for it not to be delivered to my door its delivered to my door
overall it was just a positive experience
i love good shoes and when a repair is needed i want the best to make them look as good as new
after getting no call back i have since left 3 messages in the past two weeks that have all gone unreturned
i had to write this review because the service i received was so great
if i could give zero stars i would
needless to say it was a great experience they decided to change it for a new one and apple really stands behind there product
wham is a member of the surprise chamber of commerce and local first arizona
thats bad customer service
did i mention she also provides accessories wigs shoes etc
these guys are fantastic
this is the worst place ever and the customer service sucks
i have yet to finish a conversation in my car without a dropped call
are you looking for that perfect gift for someone in the office you sort of know but not really
i think of this as the main post office and is the only one i use
finding a good shoe repair shop is like prince charming trying to locate cinderella at the stroke of midnight
i will definitely recommend this service to any of my friends and business associates that need help moving
ok i admit it ive driven out of my way to buy my coffee and teas here
we understand that
even when a corner dent presented some fitting challenges rob didnt waiver from his commitment to delivering the very best products and  services in his industry
roberto and frank were both very friendly and knowledgeable
spoke to a lady and was told to bring it back
the location is central to most parts of scottsdale and a breeze to get in and out of
i just remembered this store due to me shopping at this store a few years back and actually remember bowling in a league with mike owner before i stopped
still airing out as we speak
everyone is always pleasant friendly and have answers to all my questions
because of his excellent service with the ice maker we also had him look at the nonworking ice maker in our fridge he just explained the issue to my husband who fixed it himself saving us the money and also our frontloading he washer which had a problem with water occasionally coming into the drum between washes
ive never used them for bigticket purchases like engagement rings and the like
the best part about it is that they didnt rush they took their time so the carpet looked great
owner is friendly
so this will definitely be my new phone repair shop from now on and it should be yours too
its not even two day pickup
i used to love night time nosh but their dispatch workers are just too rude and organized
if you need an honest carpet cleaning company with reasonable prices that does a great job then call mike you wont regret it
at one point wade even came over to us after wed selected the altar boxes we wanted and asked if wed gotten all the rest of the boxes packed into my friends backpack
what can i say
the line is usually always super long and some of the workers are not too friendly
at least the 4555 yr old dark haired lady
communication was immediate
but i got a cat who just did not like me
upon picking the phone up i was charged another 35 for the proximity sensor
the staff there as far as the manager goes are very unprofessionalthey would charge you late fees and they would go ahead and lie about things that are unnecessary or unethical
it took 2 tries to get my old ps3 up and working but they got it
the owner explained to me that they cant match online prices because of the difference in overhead but that andrews will do what they can to be fair
these guys are oldfashioned craftsmen with all the plusses and minuses involved
based on reviews we read later a their sales tactics will definitely not buy their system
my boyfriend was the one initiated the contact and she did testing on my house
nice guy hard worker
brad spent a lot of time and was very thorough
you pay up front then come back when its ready
weve been using gordon family pest for about 4 months now and are really happy with their service
this is a separate part of the business
the pricing was great and the job was done right away
40 lbs of cocktail ice for 5
and the location is close to home
we were told that the threehour windows were guidelines and no one could guarantee an accurate timeframe for the filter change
i really appreciated his demeanor in explaining the situation
the lady with short black hair  that works the front is very disrespectful when i came in she walked to the front while texting on her phone she didnt look up at me or didnt have any customer service skills she didnt say a word to me
he gave me a phenomenal price and boom we were off to the races
the las vegas rescue mission has to be one of the most organized rescue missions that i have ever been a part of
boycott this small town mentality that is unconventional and not good for customers
i responded a week in advance of my appointment giving them plenty of time to review my emails
i called before coming and the employee was very friendly over the phone and told me they could provide me the services computer printer etc
these are the guys for whom it makes sense to repair shoes instead of buying new
this place has been a lifesaver
we used to go to fazio in summerlin who were usually friendly
i would not recommend using this company for anything
i cant tell you how impressed i am by this little shop
they went from making 1200 on me per year to 0
first they ruined two shirts  one actually had a tear and then another was missing buttons
if you are a regular the trainers know you and will chit chat about this or that if you engage
the customer service is horrible
the next day i email the company saying what happened at this is what i got in return   sorry that happened to you because we have 700 very satisfied customers
i would not use their printing and services aain
they attempted to ballpark my current order through email
the new company came today tri city appliance
the bikes were still dirty and i noticed the threaded ring on the front tire valve of my bike wasnt tightened down
if we do its flopping pre death
his prices are fair his knowledge is deep and he doesnt waste time
5 hours later i didnt get a response but an email telling me i had a late payment and a late fee
cracked my screen while i was in vegas called several places to get quotes and this was the lowest i could find
i have been going here on and off for years and she has always done excellent work for a very reasonable price
in 2006 my husband of 50 years was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer and in 2008 mold was detected in our home
they lost the opportunity to sell another three grand worth of merchandise as a software developer i always prefer to buy a very high end machine
its very difficult to sleep since its so loud and it literally makes the noise every time the ac turns on
i use to think that snailpaced apathetic postal employees were an urban legend
we would highly recommend this company
i really cannot say enough about their excellent customer service genuine eagerness to help and professionalism
would highly recommend
all things considered this was a very good experience
last year they took care of our cricket and scorpion invasion in 1 treatment
if you are stopping by to do a load or two pass this by
they worked with me on the price of he circuit board and managed to get a discount from the supplier
i have never written a negative review on yelp but unfortunately our interaction with this company has been a headache from start to finish and we didnt even have them complete the job
driers there are maybe 30 or so driers and they are 25 for 5 minutes
we dont get anything like that here
then i checked him out on other professional sites and have seen a pattern of horrible customer service
i used them for my move from phoenix to san diego last september
anyhow after not hearing back we were forced to call the geek squad and they helped us out
they finished my jackets within one our and they are exactly as they showed me and colors are exact
lots of built in screens on the cardio machines in main gym area
left and took my package to another fedex location and they said it was fine and it shipped
they did run a little late due to a move scheduled before me but they called prior to the scheduled start time to let me know their status
we had a rat in our pantry which we discovered a few weeks before christmas after throwing away almost everything i had hundreds of dollars worth of food no sign of the rat
they suggested the discount but he declined
will definitely refer him to friends and family and would definitely hire again in the future
we wouldnt trust anyone else
first off i was recommended here by a coworker who had a great experience before so i was eager to see for myself
suggestions 1 clear pricing
only want him to do my service
i came as my roommates guest  this lady made it so difficult
spotlight signs just did 2 banner flags for my business and they turned out great
regardless it is still my main point of copy services
it was starting to grow back in but i was still wearing my wig as my natural hair was in desperate need of a more presentable cut
stopped on a whim and am so glad that we did
needed my carpets cleaned before i moved into my new condo
the staff could not be more accommodating and friendly
i brought in 3 watches for repair and a small necklace
red carpet moving came through
the people working here seem to have a little bit more laid back attitude than the other locations in town which is nice when im in testing out the new precious
he was quickly able to commit to a two hour moving job for the next morning and spoke with confidence
so i filed a complaint through bbb
she wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package
luckily the staff was super helpful  showed me how to set my phone to where all my contact were specifically saved to my device
after a set of brief introductions they went right to work
thank you joe for your wonderful service
he listened to my needs and performed the best treatment available
yes you heard me correctly they walked off the job
wish all the best
used filthy language and wasnt wearing anything to indicate his company
it was super fast and pain less
they confirmed that they would pick me up at phx and failed to show while i waited around for an hour
the owner jared seemed to care about the children here however his main concerns are telling you that you are wrong and he always stands by his employees and not you or your child
watch what they say about particular items that they are the real deal and check it for yourself  do not believe anything this group says
i dropped the phone from hip height and the screen stopped working again
the entire reason i called precision window tint in the first place was to take my car to brians place of business to get the whole thing taken care of
best money spent
i recommend it
bb and hp wanted to charge me an ungodly amount to even look at it much less fix it
curtis is our current service agent and he is courteous timely and does his job well
im glad to see that jerry responded to my review
some random things i learnedrealized while cleaning with holly paolo lisa and eric  a childrens dictionary does not contain four letter words or anything sex related  i didnt realize barbie books were so diverse
so much better than sitting around and waiting and waiting and waiting like some other service companies make you do
the evaluator offered less than 1000 less than the value of the platinum
not only were they right on time but they were so friendly and professional
everything changed the day of the move
asked for shirts to be pressed with top button open but always get my clothes back however they felt like doing them
we had keith out a few weeks back
i think not
she is do it a super nice and wonderful service
horrible customer service and bad attitude at this particular store
at the end of the day customer service is everything
i finally made the wise choice to call az steamers and without hesitation they were able to come the next day after i closed with the cheapest prices and not even a promo
that day he arrived and had all the materials cut
however earlier they had sent me a gift card of 25 as an incentive to use them again i wouldve called them anyway so i broke even on that charge
snotty tech destroyed my phone and then told me hed rather get me into a new one
phil was hystericalvery sarcastic sense of humor
it doesnt tell you how much if any bonus was awarded
finally called around
i asked her what this was and she did not know
very quick and professional service
we had a lot of fun
don t sign up here
wife and kids gobbled down their rolls
they always smile and the wait isnt that bad at this location
ramin and his staff were over the top
i will be making pro cyclery my bike shop for future purchases and repair
i got so irritated i left with nothing her lack of costumer service costed her many costumers
it does not get any better then this people
i had been without my glasses for a few days and its such a relief to have them back in great shape
answering service took an appointment for me which could not be honored after the fact
the door closes nice and smooth without any effort and its sealed
not worth it
she understood no pressure to move forward and let me know that she was available when i was ready
not one person ive spoken to has been willing to do their job including a manager named renee who told me there was not one person above her i could speak to and there was no corporate office number btw in case you need it its 6122911000 i finally got it from someone in another department and then she hung up on me
same story as many other people shared the only thing i knew it was a bogus right from the start  so instead of even calling them i checked the web
no if it wasnt for the crazy practice of forcing the client into a positive review i could give this company a better review
i highly recommend them and if i could even give them 10 stars they would get every star
thanks again guys
i was in to drop off a package and it was quick and easy
everything was fast and they did a great job best of all they didnt charge any hidden fees
walter took the time to explain everything in detail the issue how they would repair it the time it would take and a general price
but there are a few bargains to be found
they came in and quoted 400
in their fine print it says they have 30 days from pick up to actually deliver the furniture
they were very polite and helpful on the phone
he continued to talk shit while scribbling something on his clipboard
youre going on the word of your employees who of course youre going to tell you what you want to hear because theyre probably in fear of losing jobs
the amount of time the repair took was very good
what is this
and then he just kept on complaining as if im making him do something he wasnt obliged to do
now im not so sure
stay away from this place
these folks did everything they could for me fixed my broken iphone screen which was caused by a battery that went bad
i have told friends about the great job he did
she told me that they could fix the screen and the sensitivity for 100
i figured it would be a quick search in the back boy was i wrong
i actually made an account on yelp just for this review i have gone to this dry cleaners twice in 1 week and both times have given me negative results i just got promoted so i went to get new stripes sewn on my uniform
needed to rent tables for christmas party and the young man who answered the phone after it was rerouted from the party rental department wasnt able to help me
you got to love it when they come in and fix your problem quickly and give you a great price
after my appointment hal the owner gave me a call to make sure everything was okay and although i missed the call the voicemail was very pleasant
glad everyone else had a good experience with gb
they didnt even pick up all the items on the inventory list
i was picking up some take out from next door and realized i had a package in my car that needed some delivering and decided to multi task
beware from the russia employee
vitali answered the phone and met me two hours later at the property the time i chose
trista the owner and her mom is the best
he works hard and deserves great reviews for himself and his business
when i move again because i will be moving i will use this company again
i havent been to other dry cleaners here in the valley so i dont know how the prices compare but apollos is quick has good hours and is convenient to where we live
i wouldnt want people coming in and distracting the person taking my measurements
tim and varden showed up to my house and before walking in they put on shoe booties so they wouldnt track any dirt inside
he used the hose on his tiny tiny vacuum to run over a hanging mirror
the insurance is a total rip off
from the over the phone service to the follow through with shipping the watch it was truly a smooth transaction
he came over same day and within a few days the ants were gone
i was skeptical as i always had used skinny wimp moving for my moves prior to this
i volunteer for findagrave
stay away from this establishment
the price was reasonable 12 the service was cheerful and friendly and the repair time wasnt bad 1 week
they are only open saturdaysunday
alex is great
even when i was being helped the employees seemed to have little interest in actually helping me find a bike that fit me and my needs
he came out and then when he emailed his quote he included pictures which other competitors didnt include
we left with his card a catalogue and a clearer idea of our bike options
herd immunity varies by disease but requires at least 8595 of citizens be immunized to prevent contagion
we have over 3000 feet of carpeting that desperately needed cleaning
when he finished he even took the time to clean the work area and even wiped down our countertops
i dropped off two dresses and came to pick up today thinking i would be charged 25 approx
definitely recommend this place
this second house i bought to rent out
61 a month for a resident family membership is a decent deal and its a brand new facility
always superior service by people who really know what they are talking about and really value you as a customer
tech showed up on time and explained the failure
my recommendation to you the reader of this review fly into san francisco and go to the proper passport services
what first piqued my interest to check this place out  was the sign was out in front of the mission looking like chapel
letting me know that i could have my home taken care worry free
called happy junk removal and they came out quickly and on time
have had some slacks and a blouse altered and was completely satisfied
thanks again for making our move a breeze
these 4 stars actually belong to mary the manager
the girl working the front desk was super friendly and courteous
and maria does a wonderful job with reasonable prices
wedding dress fits perfect but need to reach owner for pick up
its extremely convenient office center on this side of town
i bought some laces for my soccer shoes and they actually put in the laces to make sure they fit
i was warned before i came here that the yelp rating was low because they workers were not nice
i had an issue with the plumbing in both bathrooms and called sin city plumbing  tyler was able to come out that  day and was awesome
my labor progressed very quickly and ashley rushed over as soon as we called her
his installation was clean and quick
we also needed some tees for work so placed a custom order and got the same great quality quick turnaround and a very fair price
i told the owner of the company that i have never had such a great experience with movers
they were amazing and very fun to work with
the lady then calls me a day before my scheduled appointment and leaves me a voicemail saying their scheduling has changed so they would be coming to my house between 122pm instead of 911am how they had originally scheduled me for
he is a hard worker honest and very knowledgeable
they do charge a premium and adding 15 on to the price of a pair of jeans often doesnt sit well with people an i get that its your call
thats because they damaged it
they tell you your neighbors have scorpions and that if you dont get treated the scorpions will come into your yard

i saw all the raving reviews for jenny at perfect bride alterations  couture and had to call
the customer service here is excellent they are very friendly and helpful
words cannot express the gratitude
the sound was restored but the computer has never been the same
but leave it to this awful dry cleaner to screw it up
having an attendant provides some additional sense of security while other patrons are mouthing off about starting a fight with other family members
its a family owned and operated business which im all for
the crew arrived at the scheduled time
four years and no complaints
the movers told me i could file a report but not to expect much and after talking with this company i agree
i had my dress hemmed brought in at the breast area  brought in around my hips and added a bustle
justin from elite floor and furniture cleaning has done wonderful work for us on multiple occasions
the turned out way above my expectations
these guys got the job done with flying colors
i will be coming here from now on when i am in town
that same day
dropped my comforter off after being told it couldnt be cleaned somewhere else and to my surprise it was cleaned
i absolutely love these guys
laura  thank you for being so genuinely kind and caring
getting a hold of higher up managers to ask this question is apparently difficult also
i have used this shop about six times in the last four months
really enjoyed talking to the gentleman that works during the lunch shift
check them out it isnt very often things are this easy to maneuver
our waitress was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all of our wine questions
i scheduled to have  my dryer vent cleaned and he could have performed the service and charge me appropriately
i also bought a 6 v trickle charger while i was there
fast cheap and easy
although i first started going to her for tailoring on my pants i also started taking dresses shirts and suits to her as well
you break something of someones and then just shrug your shoulders about it as if i should have expected that to happen
the kids area is not appropriately staffed and the check in process is very insecure
i dont expect much from the post office but this one seems to be a constant headache
still dealing with the stresses of the holidays i was now having to deal with the devastating loss of my mom
i would def reccommend this company and use them again
bottom line it wasnt what she said it was how she said it and didnt try to understand what her customer needs were
thank you daydreams for opening up my world again
did you ignore the request
after sending my initial email requesting information i received a phone call daily sometimes more than once a day from their sales rep wayne
things that the sales reps said to me  yea sure we can totally help you upgrade your phone using a different phones upgrade from your family plan  no sorry we cannot help you do that upgrade
how is this company sanctioned dress
pretty good company
they were more than happy to work with us through this
i recently went there to have an old ps1 game disk cleanedcost 3 and they gave me a punch card for buy 3 get 1 free
i was told to check their website to see if the date i want is open
it tastes so yummy and h2os system takes up less room under my sink then the previous one i had
they made sure i left the store informed about my new phone and i also left the store very well protected and didnt even spend much
but the wait was definitely worth it
i asked if there was anything they could do for me maybe a partial refund
they called about 515 and said they were done early and could come now
was able to get same day service which was a huge bonus for us
ron responded within 20 minutes and now i have the tshirts in hand
in addition to the folks that use this store as their own musicians showcase you have the staff who really ruin any chance this store has of keeping me as a customer
i ordered multiple large formatted banners and i figured this would take a few days with my order and it was ready the next business morning
i would recommend these guys to everyone
not sure why i had to go through 3 staff members just to replace my earbuds with an appointment but they were all friendly
the employees have very good communicate skills and have fast service
the only other thing i noticed is that there are a few white dots throughout the screen of the phone however seeing as their screen repair costs on their website mention a price tag of 200 i am going to live with it
we had a pile of bees that had invaded our irrigation valve control boxes
the customer service here by far exceeds standards
i would recommend him for any appliance related repair
2 i would have agreed to but 5 for that
obviously capable of various tasks and will visit again
just sold them an old mac tower  display
its somewhat ok seems clean enough
im so happy and would recommend them to anyone that can use their services
i was not impressed with the employees lack of knowledge on their batter repair services and simple desire to sell me overpriced batteries that i can purchase on amazon for 30 less or more
i didnt even see a ontrac  truck pull up near my neighborhood
they have saved me more than once  have your phone done within the hour
i am super glad the location is not to far from me
this was in the middle of summer and the temps were near 110 but the movers worked their butts off
the teachers and staff are supper friendly and nice
a couple more fittings to go cant wait to see the final result
i say the pricing is very reasonable
all in all its a good place to work out and the benefits do outweigh the negatives
i would love to get my 13 back that i was not told about
this guy sewall is on the ball
they always treat you great here its busy so be prepared to wait a bit for your print order
they knew exactly where to screen and i no longer have the problem
she mentioned she was just filling in and i probably wouldnt see her at that store
i think this venue has moved away from a gay oriented center to something very mainstream
this is the classic baitswitch upsell business
anyone who is looking to volunteer in las vegas start here
eventually someone suggested i look on craigslist and i came across coversplus based in chandler
i was super impressed
love the staff the location and the fun that they provide for my children while i work
its a lost art
you need this
both people maria and dan with whom i spoke were attentive and helpful
hardworking very careful wrapped furniture well punctual professional curteous i still dont believe you guys were able to get the lazyboy up the stairs without it ever touching a wall
i found these guys through groupon and was a little skeptical by the name but lucky for me they were complete pros
this experience was the exact opposite of the first
i have managed and owned tennis retail shops of my own in the past in various locations in the us  so i dont frequently see many places that i feel are exceptional butwithout hesitation i will say that tuckers tennis is the las vegas valleys only quintessential tennis pro shop
a few minutes later a woman emerged from a back door
i own a moving company in seattle and do long hauls
we wish that our daughter didnt have to change rooms as she gets older
no hidden fees at all
you clearly dont get the point of my review which was that your front desk staff was rude
strike 3 at just past the yearmark the watch just completely stopped working
she did everything she could to ensure i was happy with the end result
top notch service
the owner is so friendly
wish i got the service specialist name just listed as ba on the receipt
of course i wont pay for the second month but the bills keep coming
a for their customer service
i couldnt be happier with the place and location
most genius idea to ever hit tempe area
this company is professional and took and engineering approach to solve my problems
now i understand all the great reviews well deserved
my oldest is now in 2nd grade and still loves to go back and visit all of her former teachers and the staff
even the little details like usb and microphone location was well thought out better than my previous experience with best buy which was also good
quick easy and got the job done
yes thats right dusty took care of an entire complex
i could hear calls and beeps but couldnt see the screen or touch to respond
i communicated with these guys by phone and email
i searched far and wide and found the reviews of printing specialist from insider pages really nice and from their website it says theyre an authorized print service provider of adobe so i figured that i would give it a try and ask for information by email first
he is obviously a sought after tailor since his shop has materials everywhere
finally asked for the mgr
too bad too their products look very nice on the website
after wallace showed up he took some notes helped unload the truck and then we talked about the price of the job
they showed me how to do maintenance how to quickly detach and collapse the trailer etc
shes professional and helpful
because these compliments are very very deserving
absolutely awful customer service
this company is perfect
im not sure about the prices because i didnt actually buy anything yet
the variable speeds arent working
he did so for only 10
ah not is the case
this place is sprawling with a full sized basketball court pool spin studio indoor running track and a full cardio lab and weight section
they were very helpful my sister was able to sign documents from new orleans choose a beautiful urn and have them shipped overnight to me in maryland
my suggestions is to get reliable technicians and definitely have more than 2 techs for las vegas
iphone5 will be back to new after the screen is fixed with quality parts and a year warrenty for well under what apple wanted
old so i get it
and while a review about a storage place isnt the most interesting storage is something a lot of people will end up needing in their lifetime
john n was simply great
i havent had someone hang up on me since i was in high school
paid for 1 week worth but only used 2 days because we were still not ready to leave him because he and other children were covered in snot when we came back to pick him up
i went the first business day after christmas during lunch
they operate under different names and phone numbers
i recommend curt mike and sandy to anyone
excellent installation job on very expensive dishwasher
and the service is always impeccable
i would highly recommend him
i even had one dog scoot all over the concrete part of my backyard and he dragged his poop all over but they managed to hose it all down and get rid of every streak and stain of poop
i like beer
came home from an out of town trip to find our hot water heater died
no hidden cost or extra fees added and they worked without a break
amazing cleaning and amazing service
upon delivery the crew actually damaged the table leaving a ugly chip on the side
the guys were on time highly professional and quite entertaining
super happy with the band
hands down the absolute worst postal office ive ever been to and ive been to lots
on both occassions they were professional prompt and very knowledgable
i run out of the house with the package to their car before they leave and then they said sorry and tried to search for my package
i would recommend this repair place
why do i have to speak to a manager just to change a pickup time from 9am to 11am when the reservation was already made
if you need your items delivered on time id suggest using someone else
they sent three men and all the supplies i needed
we moved here from alaska and were looking for a new chiropractor 2 years ago
i got the text update  all great picked up my jacket very pleased with the service and cost wise too so i will definitely go back in the future
innovative air got the job for their great service and even a discount was given for the whole situation
transferred my son over to bringem young academy with mrs gloria and her staff
i came here with my wedding dress and got a great vibe while getting it sized correctly
they wasted my whole day
would definitely use again for future furniture repairs
they work very hard for the money and certainly take pride in their work
great job and they mentioned its a very great company to work for too
he spent more time up selling me the sears credit card so i can get rewards to buy the connecting hose for my washer than explaining the product
and in apple store we dont help customer to back up data
adopting from ths has been a very rewarding experience for us and the new wolf
they showed up gladly at 10 am and finished in 2 hours
at first i thought i must be confused that id walked into an appointmentonly card shop
almost immediately he invited me to climb his ladder into my attic and listen
finally im leaving at 741pm and 16181 later
but their time frame is only about a week to get it done
the associates are very nice and very helpful
very well equipped and very nice staff
each month we expanded the delivery instructions until it read like a book that described in excruciating detail how to differentiate our house from the north pole
i only come here because of its convenient location to my home
i wasnt even aware that stained glass could easily be repaired or that it would even be in my budget to fix it
the music was great and the people watching was fun too
so then it was standing in line to check in
i would also recommend this company to my family and friends
499 estimate on repairs without testing and checking what causes the pilot to go out
as they were working the techs walked me through their process which is a 3 step process involving pretreatment cleaning and aftercare walk through
then they came up with more bull reasons asking if i sweated in it
christopher moving is one of the best experiences ive ever had
another 5star job
i recently went in after i was unable to receive any help from east valley uniforms regarding the interior crumpling of the shoe box in my 511 ankle boots
yelp deleted my first review due to lack of firsthand customer experience but i would like to point out that my firsthand customer experience with this business was extremely poor so poor that i am writing another review
we started at the closest place to our house
so ive used these cleaners at least over a handful of times and theyve never failed me
she was very knowledgeable including her supervisor isidro
we did some renos here as well and although we vacuumed well the carpets needed a good cleaning and wow  craig did impress us
he responds quickly and if you cant make it to him he will come to you
i am a runner not a cyclist
but im the worst kind of geek im a gadget geek
the only thing about this place is the outoftheway location but there was plenty of available street parking both times i went
the other two were too bad of condition but they cleaned up nicely
we will definitely be back
remember if you dont have cash ask the vendors for a slip of paper where they will write down your total and you can pay at the information booth with a creditdebit card
i had a flat tire as a result of a punctured inner tube and the repair guy working that afternoon got me fixed up and ready to go in less than ten minutes for just 18
ill definitely use them again when i need them
i was really low on cash flow and was worried if i was going to make ends meat
however with all the increases the take away of the hanger recycling discount program  took away the better discount on yelp and now i send my husband in with a picture of it and they wont let him use it
the simple fact that i caught him on camera not treating my property and still charging me put this companies integrity in jeopardy
rent a car bring back full why cant uhaul understand this
the staff was truly welcoming and they had elevators and dollies for the customers convenience
our tech even offered to spray into gaps in our house where the earwigs and others might be coming out of
rude tellers and really slow service
so i am the 5th person to write a review on this fraudulent moving company
they were also very prompt and great to work with
drop the contract shenanigans
a beautiful new building and great people
pretty much have no one has any idea what is going on
they got our order finished in an hour and helped us deliver very important documents to our client  they even called me to reassure me that the job had been printed and picked up
can i help you with something or do you have any questions
very friendly staff
bravo bruce thank you
james  marc were the guys who came out to move me
took me one week to make the appointment because they never pick up the phone and you cannot leave a message
the area of town is a little scary but that doesnt keep me away from excellent service
usually about 22 minutes a wash extra risewash available for 25 cents each washer has coloured dots stickered onto it which match up to a dryer and ive noticed many users take this as more of a suggestion than a rule but whatever works for you
my only knock against this place is that today when i went they opened a new cashier due to long lines and one of the cashiers made it her mission to make sure that the guy in front of me got to go through the new cash before i did
their inventory is what you would expect for a local small store the basics at good prices and if he doesnt have what you want he can bring it in all you have to do is ask nicely
one of them was really only passing through and still was patient with me as i mulled over which toodarnexpensiveandeasytolose bluetooth headset to buy
i have a witness to this
they didnt even address the burning smells or the sounds coming from our ac and insisted we needed the coils cleaned
ive tried to call the school back a few times but have not been successful in speaking with the director
so the shoes need a shine from time to time
the owner even asks me regularly if there is anything they can be doing better for us
i chose to accept them asis and take my business elsewhere next time
she took an hour to show us samples answer a zillion of my annoying questions
the next week i received a bill
will come back if i ever need fingerprints
we also found out that they work on our dacor rangewhich is also a little difficult to find
not only is she bluntly honest one time i came in wearing a skirt at a length she refused to let me leave with so she pinned it up but she will be bluntly honest even if you dont want to hear it
today i walked in was not greeted was not offered any help or anything
i got a great price for my stuff
i purchased a new maytag dishwasher through home depot in scottsdale and had them install it
he made several recommendations including swapping out our out of date smoke detectors
had even offered same day delivery but didnt need my stuff that quick
after the cushions were stuffed it took about 90 minutes i hauled them back to the house
so friendly helpful and theyre mission is impressive
john and his staff at tlc computors got me back up and running within a reasonable period of time
and life was good
i took my mtn bike in for a tune up today and left with a new beach cruiser kiel was great with helping me out with my mtn bike as he always is and helped me find to perfect bike for jst cruising the hood
i was given specific instructions and wasnt sure i could find the right florist
one of our ac units wouldnt turn on so we called on a sunday and had a technician there within 20 minutes
i could buy a new 4s for 199 or if i qualify for an upgrade i can get a 5s
i waited about 5 minutes for the person in front of me to be helped
great warranty too 3 months
seeing as i was to move in right then and there i had no choice but to let them rip me off
you get what you pay for
they will not give me a refund
we talked at length with the owner and learned so much about knifes and how to care for them
i hope you will fix your customer service problem
i highly recommend their services
what a great place
if youre looking for an honest working multifaceted artisan paul fits the mold
advance to 12616 and a follow up call to find out when he could be here eventually almost a week later a women called from his office and said scott is too busy for this job so hes cancelling seeing me leaving my almost a week later to start over trying to find someone who will handle this job
didnt take long at all and since i bought the bike through them i get two free tuneups
another week passed
when i pointed out the frustration of having to return now a 3rd time for an old ipad and wanting a guarantee for work quality and acknowledgement the work to this point has been subpar they instead said they wouldnt do business with me
please stay away from surewest
would recommend them to anyone
definitely much better than the mobile line from what heard
dont ever trust badger cab again
i love my backyard thanks jesse and oswaldo
i pulled into the parking lot it was almost noon 1150something
we have worked with them the last few years and they are responsive tell you when they are coming show up on time and let you know they were there all in subtle yet acceptable ways
i was hoping for warm friendly and inviting photos rather than the stuffy corporate shots i usually see
it is now nice warm and cozy where we are
i was given very bad advise by handcrafted audio on what audio equipment i should use for the audio on my harley ultra classic
they were fast efficient and extra friendly and made me feel good about doing business there
dont worry about your nice furniture getting scratched or your flat screen tvs getting damaged because titan wraps them in soft moving pads and then shrink wraps them to ensure safety
i know it was last minute so my chances were slim
she returned my garments within a week and for a few dollars less than tinas which also has many good reviews on yelp
i will never again use all my sons to move
this is the worst service i have received from any company in my entire life and i will never do business with recommend or have anything positive to say about the service at gabriels appliance
brian is great always on time professional and very thorough
my trainer art is crazy smart about fitness ask him anything  rj is motivated and positive and will light that fire in you
when i tried to explaing to lenny why i liked the bike he basically told me the athens was a great choice and shrugged his shoulders and walked away
justin you run a great business
but they are on point every single time
everything fit perfect especially with my growing belly
i had a tricky job mounting my tv on a hollow fireplace with a very uneven surface and he made it happen cords fully hidden and all
i drew attention to their mistakes and then was told again by the same incompetent secretary that on monday the first business day theyd email me
thats is just common courtesy and good business practice
i would not recommend this store for any purpose
i recently had her hem some pants i just bought
i was stunned
with an acre lot and the potential for lots of weeds thanks to custom weed  spray we get no weeds at all
they are not inexpensive either
so we originally toured a total of 6 places after moving from the southwest to the northwest and this was hands down the best choice we could have made
jordan was so nice and helpful
when we took it in we were greeted and helped right away
the girls in the front jenni and megan are so friendly and accommodating
however two days later the nail polish on my thumb came right off and my friends nail polish chipped
when they came out to fix the leak they were quick and precise
no way jose just because mbr has an upper limit does not mean gpt has a lower limit
he was professional and did a great job
2 or if you want go to desert wireless for iphone repair
got a new rack and panniers as well as some nice tires here and was happy with everythingwill definietely try service dept out this year
regularly visit ups locations all along bell rd as i have a small painting business with my fiancee and often ship express tubes with canvas in them
aside from being incredibly rude the staff here is incompetent and cannot even spell names or addresses correctly
i was able to have a quote and removal within an hour of my request for info
good stuff and prompt service
we have used them for multiple projects and have come away happy each time
we had never used a sitter that we didnt know so were really nervous but our experience with kelly was great
had several plumbing issues ranging from a toilet replacement to hose bib leaking and sink repairs the technician who came out was polite clean knowledgable and prompt at making all repairs he left my home clean and was friendly to my mischievous children
not only did my package not show but after checking the tracking number it said the driver came by and no one was home so it would be delivered the next day
when it came time to renew one of my policies they called to ask if i wanted to renew
they did a great job for a very competitive price
they wanna charge you more than other places for no reason while the guy tries to convince you they charge you more because they do a better job
i asked when it would be coming in to which he responded either tonight or tomorrow or next week
they usually have a good holiday selection for decor and more
i cant wait to meet him in real life but i also can
he had been my jeweler for over 10 years and i lost touch with him for a while only to realize his store was around the corner from my home
he defrauded us out of over 700
everything that needed attention was taken care of
can not recommend highly enough
there is a 5 fee on top of your postage each time you ask for mail forwarding
in our case they had an easy way to justify it because our manager argued with the customer service representative
he even showed up 20 minutes earlier than our appointment was scheduled which i let him know was okay in advance
this place is horrible
they couldnt care less about anyone walking in their doors
when i opened it i found a old crappy 21 inch lg monitor in it
they had the wrong size truck so gave me free furniture wrap
yeah great thing its open 24 hours
all things a print shop should offer
they do really fast turn around time and their alteration work is top notch
never hire these con artists
tony the guy who helped me was great
i work for east valley hospice and had speedpro imaging print a banner that i could take to events and presentations that we do throughout the community
whoever managed the store then was great
these guys know their stuff
worst customer service ever
the end result a beautifully tiled floor and bathrooms and washerdryer area and a great carpet job
since switching over to verizon we received the 650 rebate on one line but only received 320 for the 2nd line we switched over
as im about to leave a sales associate who id noticed standing around the whole time then approaches me
i was very pleased with the services that this company provided
he was quoted 149
it was nice taking breaks and getting to know more about the beautiful city
do not be fooled by the facility the cameras which are for show they do not record or the staffs attempt to appear as caring individuals
stop wasting your money and call mr antenna phoenix today
and still fewer have the wacky weirdass old amps to go with them
i highly recommend this place for any electronic repair
the tech couldnt do anything with my harmony remote so i now use the cox remote which is fine
unfortunately i always find myself in this area so my bad i guess  i have no other choice just my advise to the usps if they care for their reviews
they scheduled me in the very next day
used for the first time after reading other reviews
i will never go to this location again
thanks best buy
i came to this location with only 2 hours to shop before i had to check in to my hotel and run to the wedding rehearsal and i was out in perfect timing
so i had the owner andrew take a look
i called on friday afternoon needing help pretty quick since our fridge was sputtering out fast
or just go through the website
this one time a hotel actually injected advertising code into my browser to show me ads on every website i browsed i couldnt believe it
the quality of alterations isnt great either
the gift receipt that i requested online when i placed the order was not provided at the original time of pick up and i was told that another gift receipt could be printed later
joel continually goes above and beyond the call of duty and always does it with a smile
although i wasnt home when the work was done my wife told me they were super thorough and i saw the results when i got home
when i received the cards i noticed the die cut was wrong
the lady there was so incredulous that the work was bad
update  whiting iron surprised me this week by calling to say they had the double lock for my gate
steer clear of this company
he was so quick with the install mindful of our space dogs and left the area super tidy
some hiccups in the beginning but the staff came through in the end to help solve my issues
place is nasty dirty
again i was incredulous over this reply as in my experience you cannot stretch silk
sticker logo on vehicles  round 3x5 stickers  logo design and redesign  and invoices
what else can you ask for
so we woke up this morning at 6am to a very hot house because our ac had gone out over night
there was no charge for that service
im not recommending them because of that but i thought you should know they strive to go above and beyond for their customers
they built my new tower and went over all of my questions and concerns
it seems a poor use of postal employee time to have hordes of customers in line for nothing more than a purchase of books of stamps
he didnt really get anything out of the carpet
then they tried to charge me for the 2 12 weeks extra
they were lifesavers in moving boxes and being patient with 3 sisters having to look in every box
if youre looking for top notch help and unreal service these guys are your ticket
their canvas prints are amazing and superior to one i got done somewhere else or any other ive seen on the street
we highly recommend affordable flooring  more
the quality is impeccable and we experienced great service in shop
very reasonable prices with a promise of 24 hour turn around
my wife and i visited the place march 2016 and decided to try them out with our 2 yr old
jason was the person that greeted me when i walked in
he did a great job
whether his tip fixes the problem or not i will always use his services
and at no charge
having such a wonderful alternative to the post office in a convenient location is so great
i know of we ever need any other work done we will go back in a heartbeat
just dont go here unless you plan on spending roughly 15 a load
my truck stop working out of the blue
i realize they are faking they are local when in fact  they are in different state  trying to get money to contract flowers and charge extra
my one little gripe my own fault is that if you put the card in start a machine and forget to remove your card you will end up purchasing a doublewash
are you afraid that coming out from under said rock will encourage newtons law of gravity to have said apple strike you on the head from above
i am thrilled with the clean condition of my carpets

they provided a number of options to choose from with many shapes sizes colors and accessories

upfront disclaimer  its been several years since ive lived in the area and used steves
i have never had a problem and would without hesitation recommend this daycare
the spay neuter clinics are fabulous and a huge money saver
i can also view my son at any time by checking the cameras via an iphone app or online

they have a very good size menu and the prices are fair
the first week i dropped my child off the teachers were super nice

we dropped off our items on tuesday the 8th and planned to pick up around the 18th or 19th of sept when we received no call we tried to call in the following monday the 21st to speak with the seamstress
he is very honest and have our best interest in mind
great work reasonable cost
i have been shopping with the mulqueens for many years
so a convertible is okay but having roll bars is not okay because its not a hard top great logic uhaul
you also want to stop here for practical reasons a potty break
the usual great selection  prices but i found the staff well above the usual gc standards
vinney explained to us that he uses the best glass and the best parts for phones unlike other shops who buy the cheaper parts that keep breaking and breaking and making customers spend more and more money
please dont get scammed like we did
he said that hed just returned to the office and wasnt sure what had gone on prior to that
they immediately assessed and controlled the situation at a reasonable price
not the local workers faults tho  i emailed my aunt about 5 days later she didnt get it
i had booked my move in advance and at the last minute i had to cancel due to problem with the condo i was moving to

on top of that their customer service is the absolute worst i have ever encountered
i returned the next day to pick up the items and found that 1 dress had been ruined with a burn hole in the front and a blue  white sweater had been ruined and was now a pink  blue sweater
i would go back again if anything were to happen again
they also showed up on time thats hard enough to find in this town
very clean lots to do for all ages
they say they are backed up now itll be 4 to 7pm

for a house like mine that had a high scorpion population they highly encouraged a two week follow up to make sure that they were knocking down the population quickly
the pricing on their website is not accurate
ann in the office saved out bacon
he cleaned from top to bottom without wasting any time at all no breaks on a 34 hour job

irina is a breath of fresh air
the two associates working behind the counter could not be bothered with helping me
maybe that sounds like faint praise but in todays world straight shooters like chris and company are to be lauded

i had originally taken my ring to fast fix to get cleaned up but they said i needed all 5 prongs for my pearshaped diamond replaced which would cost me close to 200

he double checked with me that everything was correct and even called me to make sure that he was doing exactly what i wanted
they came on time were exceptionally courteous and clean wearing booties inside and had very reasonable prices
i think the price was reasonable and worth paying to know they stand by their work and arent going to rip you off or wrongly charge you for services

all they did was wipe surfaces with a dry rag they sprayed some solution on our marble floor which made it sticky

he was excited to go to school everyday made lots of friends and grew so much
i was absolutely appalled at the behavior of maurice christopher
he is very efficient
they helped cut moving time in half so the total price of the groupon and the little extra time we went over was well worth the price
this time was the last
i will be using them in the future and will recommend them highly
all the reviews are right this company is fantastic
so now lets see if they take care of the problem

he was prompt professional and went out of his way to make me a happy customer
so by far all about serving stands above the rest
my options are to have you replace the compressor knowing the unit is old and will continue to have problems and will continue to break down
so i paid the 185 for the watch and settled in for a long wait
he was trustworthy and candid in his recommendations for our home and his team was able to complete the work within a week
the cost was very reasonable and will definitely be calling for my future needs

they did the demo found a little bit of mold did the remediation on that  got it tested and then began the repairs as we got into the repairs we found out that the tile in my bathroom was nowhere to be found
their solution to solving the issue was to give me the number of another moving company

dave made the wedding band to match perfectly to my fiancs engagement ring
we absolutely loved wmg
specifically  karla she went beyond my expectations

i used this company for the first time on my vacation home
he took the time to explain the process in laymans terms and he kept me up to date with progress by texting every few days

sure three were occasional hiccups here and there but they were always promptly and courteously resolved
he indicated that he has requested it 3 times but i have the documentation showing that i have sent it 3 times
i made an appointment for my gas dryer to be fixed after another company damaged it further and the tech from wrights was ontime very well priced courteous and fast

considering the amount of money ive spent over the years using their services extremely poor customer service
long story short great cleaning subpar cust
this was my second time using pristine cleaning and it was even better than the first time
so bottom line with rons awesome help we picked an amazing ring for an excellent price that my girl now loves
i will definitely use their services again
shes learning valuable lessons about sharing respect and potty training while also learning her alphabet numbers colors shapes and animals much sooner than she would have by staying at home
they managed the entire process from organizing the items in the estateestimating their value and conducting the sale through the disposal of the remaining items

knowledgeable reps i grade 4 only because when i send my 20 year old staff people to buy stuff they cant seem to get help for some reason

when i didnt hear anything else i went back to get them and the stains were worse
but the coolbike fad also provides a large enough customer base for serious cyclists like me to find the stuff they need in a store like a floor pump that goes past 170psi that i couldnt find in all the other shops ive been in eg
i was in and out of there in no time
dude is a beast

the cabinets are solid beautiful and functional

i have to say that they are very organized and have their act together
we moved again and got a 2nd crew
there are certainly other places to order parts and have them installed but youll miss this little slice of americana serviceoriented nirvana that hardly exists anywhere anymore
he looked at the door and asked  why are you replacing it
i said hello since she didnt look interested at all
he even cleaned my freezer drawer
i had one auctioneer midnight sun antique auction company try to sell me a authenticated preston monogye piece of work
we dont do that
its a great family business
first i tried to order business  cards and a door sign for my new business and they completly forgot to send out for the design and place the order
the owner is so friendly every time i come in and they make dropping off  picking up clothes so easy
change your name to super suck cleanersnext step im calling my friend darcy with a little news cast
even my husband was impressed with the finished product and that says a lot
its called discretion or using your brain as i like to say it
i went to norms they took one look at the watch and said oh yeah we can fix that
watched 3 staff members not close gate one leaving one coming and one getting drinks with kids all at seperate times one adult to 8 babies in infant room as second teacher was absent
from the minute i walked in lyne made me feel great
i would definitely use lifetime moving again in the future
we carpeted our whole house did a bathroom remodel and tiled our mud room and we were very happy with ctw and especially all the support from cody
i asked around and did some research to find a moving company who would not charge a ridiculous amount for the few items i needed to move just a few blocks away
i have no idea what happened
he brought plenty of samples and was able to give us advice on the type of screen to use we went with the solar shade that helps to keep the heat out but allows us to see out at our mountain views
i only needed to go 6 miles and i was charged 115 the most ive ever had to pay for a tow was maybe 80 dollars and it was for much further
i will definitely use them again but will make certain they know to only promise times they can deliver on
very rude with no concern for the customer
i came in on thursday with a gift card to spend
hope this is helpful
prices are always reasonable along with quality
im seriously afraid that this company and guy has my address to my home
ask for jazman she great
he shows me one other black dress that he has under misa and says its obviously not my name
i appreciated his thoroughness and attention to detail
the thing about this eos location that i absolutely love is their kids club
two years later were still using this place
so my next option was to find an upholstery shop and that is when i came across sonnys
we will call az firemen movers with any future moves whether it is in the house or across town
its difficult leaving my son to go to work but its comforting to know he is being cared for by amazing people
very clean facility
he says he just came from a house where he cleaned up cat urine and thats why it smells bad
if you need a vehicle wrap window vinyl door magnets or promotional merchandise  do not look any further than fasttrac designs
my father never wanted a cremation and it was very upsetting
what i love is that she gets my color as close to the scalp as she can so that it lasts a few extra weeks
of course all i can find online is the 800 number for the entire fucking usps
there are picnic benches along the west and north edges of the pool and in the early evening there is plenty of shade for onlookers
i was having an issue with a water line not getting any water and jack came and fixed it like new
i highly recommend this store and location
in the meantime she scheduled an appointment for a few days later to ensure i was on the books
desert storage is one of the cleanest storage units i have ever used
i called the store and they promised delivery in 23 business days
i was able to walk on the carpet soon after
movinghelpcom has no 800 number
im a happy customer
first of all the sweetest lady ever
the movers on the other end who helped us unpack said they had never seen things packed so well
only bring something here to be cleaned if you want to punish it or yourself
lots of variety and different price ranges for everyone
they are so irresponsible
as we finally entered we headed to photos with santa first to get that out of the way
they dont do appointments you just drop by
this is good if youre a beginner and not sure where to start or how to breathe
they prefer a 4 hour notice for setting up service
this is 9 years that we have stored our stuff at this location
turned out they lived up to the hype
wouldnt wanna fix their mistake neither admit their fault
got a call first thing the next morning with confirmation that it was exactly what he thought as he verified with manufacturer and already ordered part
the customer service girl would not do anything to resolve the issue
how could i resist
tiffany cleaners is rather far from where i live in henderson but took the drive because of the rave reviews on their service with higher end clothing
i brought in my 2014 vehicle for a courtesy tire rotation having purchased replacement tires in april
next to that wall is the main dining room which is spacious
on the phone i mentioned that i did not know what the problem was but that the filter was expired so perhaps that was the problem
which was also documented when they woke up the first thing my 2 year old said is wheres karen
came in here to drop off a package that was on my account a couple weeks ago
the staff here cannot measure
they are professional show up on time and get the job done
i paid the company extra to have items packed that i couldnt
of course for its later the lights are off and the children are resting
kind of like the dmvsometimes long lines and lots of waiting
obviously not for this store
i just show them my email you dont have to bring in a printed out copy
the shoes look like new
overall i had the best timely affordable service that i could expect
he was done quickly and efficiently
i was told it works no matter what
i definitely recommend using them for custom shirts even if you just have an idea from an image on the internet they will make sure you get exactly what you want
what a wonderful way they run their store
so what did i do
apparently the day before was completely packed
from bed cleanup edging trimming to mowing atlantic delivers
took it home reattached it to the power and it started right up
he completed the work quickly and efficiently
my restoration was a brass fire extinguisher a far simpler project
their upsell pitches which are not much of a difference than a car salesman
job was done great very knowledgeable great attitude
he was also very cost efficient
for example if i find a great leather jacket at a thrift store that needs cleaning or in this case i found a delicious pair of cole haan nike air booties at a thrift store for 12
no biggie i was expecting a call on what to do with the fork once they had some more information on it so i was surprised when i finally called on thursday to check on my bike and was told it was done
not a single scorpion sinceor any bugs for that matter
i was impressed
in addition fire ants began to emerge
richard and his crew are amazing
was on the phone
however these guys he flaked out on me
first time i went here to mail a package it took longer than the longest line at the post office  i was their only customer
luckily amazon refunded me my shipping costs already and have assured me i will receive a call 30 minutes before the driver arrives tomorrow
after waiting 20 minutes i called back and canceled and the guy seemed like he could have cared less
i recommend you use any other company or just live with the issue rather than waste your hard earned money expecting any results from this company as they will not back their work or product
i will not be shopping at this location or any other location and will be sure to make sure i let my peers and family know not to bring their business there as well
really appreciate his help and that of oneguard for selecting a good reliable company to service my appliances
absolutely terrible service
they were punctual and efficient
they were super friendly and the place is clean
im not really sure what the draw of this place is
i reminded him that this wasnt a problem i caused and to please not be angry with me
i could tell she had been crying for a while cuz her skin was blotchy
really nice and thoughtful people at this store prices are fair they do their best and thats good enough for me
i also had a 7500 gauthier modern black pearl ring that they offered me 200 for uggh
it was a couple hundred under what i thought i may get way way less than what i paid for it but i understand everyone needs to make money
i have also had a great experience with their hvac division
only use this store if you want your package to be lost or stolen and never delivered
they may have long time client contracts like my condo management but thats about it
the next problem that i had was when i received a letter in the mail stating that because i have two locks on my storage units they were going to cut one off from each unit
talk about knowing his business
so i get to the store and go to the mobile phone department
lastly there is a small room for producers with an array of monitors studio desks etc
i am still without a functioning washing machine and am being forced to allow ada to come back to assemble the machine in order for ahs to consider covering the machine at all
maui did a great job fixing my sons laptop
unfortunately the technicians left my house without putting the motor back on
i called them back and was told they were having another person deliver the washer and they would call before they arrived but should be here around 7 or 730 pmagain nobody came and nobody called
she was very apologetic i found the quality to be worth it
i had great service with the massage therapist but dr woolston is unfriendly as well as his reception staff
never disappointed with the postcards and business cards ordered through op
this alphagraphics saved me big time
everything i look for in a dry cleaner
i was very frustrated at this point
i highly recommend steel creations  fabrications for all your fence needs
he removed all gum and cleaned the carpet through out the facility cleaned  waxed our floors as well as cleaned  sealed the tile in our bathrooms
they said that if she didnt call back in 5 minutes they would reschedule
then within five minutes we had a pile of possibilities which the suitguy was patient enough to pin and tuck as i cast my critical eye over everything
im not trying to trash the place but three times of getting stuff ruined was enough to warn others
after applying and sending my resume to several jobs around the country i quickly got call backs and second interviews from multiple places and was flown to three different states for third interviews
we quickly established that wed need 30 gallons per month 6 5gallon bottles
and on top of it the prices were again extremely reasonable much more reasonable than buying a new pair
the guests were in love with the save the dates and invites as well as the escort cards
i suggest go online give it a shot and save
my pair of boots needed a sole protector with grip and of course i want vibram soles
so i was yelping along looking for a place to get my bike adjusted
the mozzarella sticks house salads and desserts compare to some of vegas top restaurants
not sure why natalis had such a bad experiencemust have been having a bad dayweek
yelpers please message me with recommendations for a good dry cleaner
i did call after i got the complaint from my hoa and talked to fallon she was the 1st nice person there i talked to and i learned that there is a supervisor above anyone i had talked to before
this is exactly why i use yelp to find companies
youd be much better off going to the apple store at the forum shoppes at caesars palace
he maintains good quality and house specials even though there are standard options
seriously couldnt be happier
one of the screws is missing
they didnt lollygag to run the clock
eric was polite and not pushy at all
i give those workers lots of credit for being as patient and friendly ish as they are
he promised to be back in 15 minutes with the cables and would leave them in my screen door
i was helped by joe and he was wonderful very sweet man
not horrible and they did call when on the way
stop driving around town and check out cliffs pony express if you can not drive down their website is super convenient too for ordering and tracking
hours are good as well
i have a better rate with another company
kyko came up with 5 stars so i called them
they still getting paid
they were there to answer my phone calls of the weekend when my plans changed
who doesnt appreciate a nicely polished bag
they were friendly prompt and professional
fast and affordable they gave me an 3  5 business days turnaround timeframe
so we had to turn off water to the whole house
my butt isnt as big as i thought and they slits in back of the suits will work after all
i hit lotto though with our packers
if your weeds are taking over your yard call absolute pest solutions today
we had them purchase it through us as they know what they are doing and definitely at a level that exceeds mine and my husbands knowledge obviously
this location has a lot of semitruck traffic safety deposit boxes and is located in a less than stellar neighborhood
thank you so much
he reviewed the areas for standard treatment and then asked me if there were any concerns
very difficult to deal with though i think this is a standard in the moving business
great quality doors and nick our installer was very friendly and professional
i called my home warranty and they were not able to get anything done
champion is exactly what i expect from a pest control service  great price no hassle and always courteous and professional
jasmine and her team are truly the best
i tried to talk to him but he brushed me off and simply said the 995 a month plan right and kept walking
if your device needs repair i highly recommend you take it here
i admit the location had me questioning this as an option but its sorta like finding great restaurants in strip malls
and while youre looking for meoffer to buy me a book of stamps or a gtim easy like that
just moved from bronx  new york and i needed help with my washer and dryer
we always get our water here
i have a 160 charge on my cc and still broken tablets
professional and courteous
we added a self closing gate with a magna latch for additional safety for our 9 month old and 3 year old
her prices are awesome as well
absolutely pleased with the results of the vehicle
we thought we would have to buy all new carpeting for our bedroom or maybe the whole house because all of the carpeting is the same
they were patient and explained everything
i had tried two other dry cleaners in the area and wasnt very satisfied with the level of customer service i was getting so i decided to try this place
they give you quite a bit of each kind of meat which can limit your variety
my intention was to pay for another year but instead she was insistent on making that extra 10
from what i can tell they did a pretty good job there too
i made 3 attempts to purchase and to get educated on a new mountain bike
it said free wifi but i could not get it to work granted i didnt ask for a password if needed
the owners were rude ganged up on me yelled at me and basically brought me to tears because they refused to accept any culpability that a chair may have been damaged as a result of decisions that they made and recommended to me
no frills no gimmicks here
i feel very comfortable working out here and i hope the ymca west shore family branch continues to provide a safe clean and inviting place to exercise for people all around my community
don is a talented polite and hardworking man
lisa s did a great job on my home
the portion from the gate to the house was off 6 degrees
i need to talk to a tech so i register
they sent out three very friendly and pleasant movers who really worked quickly and made it a joy on an otherwise very hectic day
please read two updates posted after the initial review initial review please be careful with this company
so we have to be without water for a whole weekend due to them not installing correctly and their workers taking their trucks home when off for serveral days
i have been very happy with their work thus far
i actually found the warranty cards i cant beleive i still knew where i kept them i sound like a very organized person
i have to say this moving company is very professional and helpful
canpar in their imagery world where people dont work only deliver mf 96pm and cannot provide any time window for the delivery so you just have to miss an entire day of work and sit around waiting for your package
so happy i found it
we met joe and we sat down and filled out the paperwork
i highly recommend slippery pig
i am very happy with his work and service
i would never go with this company again
i didnt know what to do i was actually thinking about buying a new phone but my dumb self didnt think about having the screen fixed
small dishes are cheaper but comes in smaller servings
and it took a very long time
the owner kept going on and on about how my dad was out of line with his employee and how he gets so many people lying about losing or damaged clothes
dont buy their groupon
we received so many compliments  people couldnt believe that such a pretty dress came in my daughters size
she called the other post office and found out why my package was marked undeliverable
having 4 kids can really wreak havoc on carpet and it really looks brand new
the ups store at 11035 w summerlin centre dr las vegas has great customer service
speaking with them on the phone initially was pleasant so we scheduled a visit and actually came in a couple times first time being just my husband second time being the both of us
though the original quoted price was already reasonable my final bill was reduced and i left very happily
on my first trip to batteriesbulbs i took a nicad rechargeable battery in that i hadnt been able to find anywhere not even on the internet
sounds like they just want to collect a service fee from the warranty companies and run to the next house as fast as possible
all of my things were handled with care and the entire move went smoothly
i called my home warranty company for a repair on 3 items
they are crooks
i took some of my watches there to get sized and they did a great job
it started working  dumping ice and i tested it next day  had a flapper issues on dispense so i called scott told him i had replaced that part last fall and may have not done it right
i scheduled it for 430  he was done in a little over 20 minutes just like he promised
he was very honest when i asked him for advice on how the clothing should fit and be altered
taking my flatmates key to timpson in order to provide a template i was quickly handed a shiny new one in an instant
ill be back habib
it was pricey but its a high end watch and still 5060 less than at the store where i purchased the watch two decades ago
i would refer them to anyone
i wont go anywhere else
all in all its a nice storage facility with great amenities
the appointment was set up for 800am and right off the bat jacob and vince were onsite and polite and friendly throughout the whole move
i can only imagine how well the animals are taken care of at their rescue
kraftmad kay found out that a joann fabric store was in this west mifflinjefferson hills shopping plaza and had to drag me along so as to get her fix
will never take my dry cleaning anywhere else
pay double and get it fixed somewhere else otherwise you are just going to end up with a product that was worse off before it came in
nothing is repeated everything is done just to get it over with and when i asked whether or not they have any written materials available i was willing to pay for the print outs i was told to take their introductory to sewing class where materials are distributed
we highly recommend this company for all of your appliance repairs
a week or so later i called again
the dj also had a great personality
the issue is this our microwave doesnt heat up any of our food
i first used them in 2012 from a third story move to single level
this place is fairly clean
it is peoples money
it wasnt necessarily the content of what she said but her manner
it was a fine italian suit not a rip in a pair of blue jeans which i made very clear when i first arrived
i have no clue what to do with these things since i dont like to wrap my bed up like a hotel every single day
the hidden doors are an obvious reminder of this carefully planned duality as is the almost violent contrast of physical symmetry and human disorder within the store
i literally watch lasership drop a package of at my neighbor on my right and my neighbor on my left when i was expecting a package that day too
i go to pay and was told that they forbid me to resale these shoes
jose and jason were very professional while being personable
not to mention it wouldnt have happened today new phone release  anyway im beyond glad i decided to go with mobile device docs
this company deserves them
theres chickens a little playground and even a dope permaculture garden in the corner students are presently in the process of growing
they didnt return our calls and then showed up at the wrong time on the wrong date
this gym is really nice
vladimir was great
these guys are superb
they give expired food to kids rob you for tuition and overall just a dirty environment
you have been warned
unbelievably amazing customer service and i am amazed at the quality of the work they do at such a fast turn around
bugs in vegas
well worth the 1 for 3 minutes to make laundry a little less of a chore
they dont care about your clothes
i couldnt believe it
excellent service and price
i used soft touch for the 2nd time on may 20th for a whole house move since the first time they helped move odds and ends to our new house
not the case at delias
its always busy but their system is so efficient you never have to wait long and they almost always address your problem right away
rich the technician charged 75 for the part
john fixed both of our toilets in 30 minutes
catalina is a fraction of my other place so i naturally assumed the quality was going to be an issue
i hate this location and their service is so terrible
we were able to depart without too much guilt and we called about 10 minutes later to check in on her daughter whom they said was having a great time playing store with the other kids
we rented storage space from extra space storage and there was extenuating circumstances that needed to be dealt with
id give this place negative stars if i could
they just fixed my iphone 6 glass and all in 15 minutes
rick said he would do it over no problem but not until tuesday when we do the ducts
no i screwed up and should have checked
i carefully packed each pair in its own bag for transport as i said pricey boots but i could see no benefit in insisting on the return of my property
they have lost a very consistent customer
i have now been to both the denver and charlotte locations and they are both fantastic
so i called up and bought a weekend ticket at face value
john honoured what his employee had told me and was still very nice about it
if youre looking for a true familyowned and honest plumbing company who really cares about the customer they wont disappoint
third issue i just picked up a pair of pants yesterday to wear
the only comment that i have is that the sauce they use on pizza needs a little work
called locksmith companies for me

i always kind of feel like im bugging him by being there lol
never underestimate the eating prowess of misti y and bobby y who can be formidable eaters if it suits their fancy

i have contacted a couple other places and this one seems to be the best in my opinion
i called 2 times to see why he was having so many accidents and for the center to please remind him to potty
however the size that fit everywhere else had too long of arms
my first experience and definitely not my last
the prior reviewers complaining about give the attendant money to run a machine did not choose to purchase their own money card
worked fine for 4 years never one issue
cameron and mike in pittsburgh were amazing
they did an outstanding job moving us into our new home
now my shuttle is working like brand new

the initial technician placed the cover in the bedroom incorrectly and a small portion to different color painted wall is visible
that plus a new cover and we are set
they showed up on time they packed our belongings with skill and care and everything 500 items of furniture and boxes was delivered in perfect condition
eugene was the tech from appliance repair experts who properly repaired my lg washer
i am on a third one and have to do the same
rachel the representative at the front desk was so nice and very helpful
michelle the owner took the challenge in stride
i explained to them what was going on gave them some background about some off grounding in my house
this should of been expected from a place that looks on the outside to be across between a pawn shop and a bail bond agency
seemed to do a very thorough job and did well to explain each of the control techniques
grateful to have found this establishment and looking forward to having my two year old grow here over the next few years
what i noticed is that an hour after they opened there was no one in line but about 100 people sitting
i used to see ants crickets and spiders previously but havent seen any in a few weeks since they sprayed our house
my daughter had a blast and asked to go back for a while
i am proud to have bulwark as my exterminating company and chuck as my tech
their prices were fair and accurate
and the price was more than fair
but once i got it back the speakers were not working no alarm phone calls on speaker no video sound and the screen would flicker if you pushed it on the corners
with over half a days notice staples who had charged me a premium to print out a colour print job by 7pm
we would definitely use compudoc services again
and few of us can afford to throw out expensive ones
was i groggy or was there not a buzzing
when we moved into our house we realized we had a pretty significant scorpion problem
get people to answer the phone who arent bothered by customers
i was 30 minutes late for my appointment but they were very gracious and waited for me
had to go wait in line 45min yet again to get it figured out
check out the yelp pictures
recently had a gate installed on my brand new home and the installer damaged my stucco in 23 areas then tried to patch it however it was done poorly and it needs paint
they were able to answer our questions and all in all helped a big deal
very polite careful and so hard working

when i want to hear some old school jams stuff i was rollerskating to when i was a kid in the late 80searly 90s i tune into mega 1043
what attracted to me to the store first was the coupons that competed with big chain craft stores
unlike radio shack i even asked for a good place to eatsuch a yelper
when i showed it to the seamstress she got defensive and said that i told her that i didnt want it tight
again folks it isnt about the bad experience its about what he did to make it more than right
worse place ever no customer skills what so ever would never recommend this place stay away very rude people work there
nate the notary was especially helpful on the phone and in the store
weve been customers of sparkletts for some time now around two years or so

they were great the asked a few questions and got right to work

he helped me with my sons phone before he left on a mission trip and mike did everything possible to urgently fix it
i came here to have my bike checkedup and have some little repairs done
the carpet was dry within a few hours and looked great

austin helped me with a replacement battery for my macbook pro and assured that he would only fix what needed to be fixed and nothing more
mix the stress of more customers than range lanes with amateur shooters and anyone would have a tendency to be short by the end of the day
when i started the lease they said that 30 days notice was all i needed to do to cancel

the store was busy so they had plenty of others to chit chat with so why me
its all about getting you and your bike back on the trail
the girls were friendly when i went in to get some jeans pinned for alterations
the farmers market spanned through two buildings one room was full of mostly hot food and some other canned foods meats and cheeses
so i called the general information number and was told the price increased to 75 in this demographic area
the problem is that they screw up orders regularly and assume zero responsibility for their mistake
while looking around i had stopped into walgreens and a young man helped me price out their cards which are horrible prices
wouldnt even take a tip

all the stylists are incredibly sweet

this is an interesting spot with a lot of potential but unfortunately most of it is lost as the location is not ideal thus resulting in very little foot traffic
this location is usually really busy but the employees are friendly and helpful
ive been happy with every touch up restoration shine heel replacement pretty much anything express shoe repair has done for me
i want to say  thank you brittainy and manager for fixing our experience
i give them zero stars but yelp is making me put something in the stars box
just stopped by yesterday while we are in vegas as one watch was running a bit fast
friendly informative repairman arrived and unit was repaired within the hour
some of the products i can find em at marcs and earth fare way cheaper
i dont know why people need to bitch so much
will come back and do recommend
quick  1000  ill try it at least once
i brought the bag in showed them the issue got a quote and timeline and they were also very upfront about the fact theyd be off the following week for summer holiday and told me what kind of timeline i could expect
and to date we have always received our packages on time and undamaged
the prices were quite different but when i arrived i found out why
i will really use them again
when you call to explain why you are not renewing your contract you are sent to john the owner
he made sure all broken glass was removed keeping the area clean
they come when they are supposed to and are punctual
lady says it will definitely be done by then
these guys were awesome
they replaced the bad battery and lcd which the lcd went bad after 2 weeks
then an old woman i presume to be his wife started yelling at me about my manners completely ignoring her husband wagging his finger at me
my son loves his current teacher thinks the world of her
we paid a little extra 5 for adults and 3 for kids to see the animals
beautiful silver collection my favorite
my parents also bought all of their new appliances from sears
this small cemetery is close to reaching capacity so if you want a plot there is not much space left
mark even passed up dessert with his family to come back out and do an extra enzyme treatment while the carpet was still wet
but he answered hours
the cobblestone roads give it the most character  the people are very friendly
heythey always have my paycheck on time
i no longer live in az but wish i could have taken steve with us
we have been coming here for over 10 years
thank you mike
the facility owners provided me with a free padlock for my storage unit which i now believe they had a spare key toalthough ill never be able to prove that nor can i prove what i had before i stored my belongings there vs what i have now
i did not receive any service done by this company but my first impression of them is a bad one
we had just got out storage a week ago and we come the next week to put more of our belongings into our storage to find out from one of the electrician workers saying that this place was infested with bed bugs
ok so no one likes to do laundry and no one wants to pay for it
my screen was fixed in 30 minutes and they even match groupon coupons from other companies
according to our bill which took 3 days to get we were charged 299 for the camera which shouldnt have been included because according to the supervisor it was already included with the hydrojet pricing 1400
she was so affordable too
everytime i need something clean or protected i can count on them
moving into the new house took longer than i expected but was not by too much
all of the employees seem to remember my name when i visit and my order is always completed on time and correctly
only the queen in this case is in cupertino
within an hour he was at my house walking me through the process
then they finally get back to me and long story short im in the wrong line
he was professional friendly and  answered all my questions and did an awesome job
my home air conditioner broke on a friday morning in phoenix in july
they will then treat your stuff like trash and toss it around like bags of dog waste
i contacted a few other junk removal companies but i had the best experience with brandon
i would highly suggest this service
were telling everybody about ateam
customer oh no i guess i didnt
we had to walk in the heat of summer to pep boys as the gas station on the corner same side has no public bathrooms either really
there is no online access nor can you email the teacher or call herhim directly
the tailoring was sloppy and the merchandise in the store was overpriced
water heater pros has one of the best quotes and told us the price included the new heater labor and the city permit required for install
being an office manager for many years and having dealt with many many air conditioning companies and individuals i must admit that i was extremely impressed and pleasantly surprised at  the accuracy and efficiency provided to us by this company
cleaners came no vacuums no mops and no obvious cleaning products
we set up an appointment through home depot which was very easy and convenient
my couches look fabulous
i dont want to give out his pricing online but if youre interested in what it cost to have  a sofa chair and ottoman cleaned pm me
sure ill probably revisit bcs to check out their sale in june but for now ill hop on over to pedal performance and see how they stack up
they also have a kids playing area and lot of hiking trails
they had a lot of obviously broken and unusable items in the knick knack section more than i usually see at goodwill
it was on a fri early evening around 5pm when i came home from work to the horrible sight of the bugs  no other pest control company was available
it was great
i came in here looking for books and lord have mercy did i find them
i have been using them for 7 years
i have ahs insurance and was getting screwed by their recommended plumbing contractors supposed nonnegotiable necessary additional parts and fees
with the vast amount of chain stores and cheap jewelry online i would think that local shops would do  to get and keep new customers not drive them away
we follow the fedex packing guidelines from their website
he did tell me that other bees will come back over time since there is still honey in the wall
i would not hesitate to use them for our future moves
it all made me cry but the memorial package was beautifully and thoughtfully put together
i have been using them for 2 years
he just looked at me like okay i said im sorry i usually get my prints printed through a photo company online and ive never been there before so i wasnt sure what to do yes i repeated myself i had a usb so he sent me to the computer to print what i needed
your better off going with anyone else
well be repeat clients for periodic cleaning
that had accumulated in the side yard was gone
i brought a good friend of mine there to search for the perfect engagement ring and all other jewelry stores that he had visited paled in comparison to the service and quality
sometimes you want to polish it up and make it look new other times you want to let it be and let that distressed look shine through
i cant ask for any more in a cleaners
towards the end of the massage i couldnt wait to review these ladies
terrible terrible terrible
were not at all apologetic about the matter
during that time i had taken two other items for hem jobs and got them both back within an hour and the other place was 5 cheaper than this place
delivering packages to the wrong address should not have happened and is not acceptable
ok i came back and paid 20 zipper came back off the first time i tried to wear the boot
i hung up and did some research we found that he was the only person who said that he didnt need to come down and check it out
ive used a lot o storage and this was one of the cleanest and friendliest
our son has been attending ccsd pre k now since the beginning of the school year
one of the trucks i had 379 had a somewhat large hole in the floor where the movers had to step around in order to load furniture onto the truck
i couldnt even speak to the lady in the line from the other storage place without call after call coming in
im sticking with ups even if i have to drive out an extra few minutes
the tec asked a bunch of questions and said it probably wasnt the compressor
xtreme av will be the only company i use for my av needs
gangplanks mission of building a collaborative community is working as evidenced by the lack of chairs now at events
i would recommend a flamingo glass and engraving for any engraving needs
since my house was already prewired for surround sound it was a pretty standard job
nice personable knowledgeable
my bracelet was very delicate made with gold
i guess someone else had already taken care of it and it was all clear
i needed to fax a pretty large document and stopped by here to get it done
i have video of them dropping my fridge with the dolly instead of setting it down with the dolly
thats not true its the way my nail was filled in 8500 for that and pedicure ill be finding a new salon
i met the store manager rhonda
you just need to show up with an empty cup and leave your ego at home
i called appliance works based on the reviews i read on yelp
if you dont want to throw away several hundred pounds of food try someone else
i have used other ups stores and they dont compare to the service i receive from this store
answered a multitude of cycling questions i had with patience and enthusiasm
simply went in to get a spring bar fixed on a watch i did not purchase from oliver smith
i get people stopping me all the time to ask about my car and where i got it done
you can either do it yourself or leave it for them to do it
they come to me for pick up and delivery which i absolutely love
they are typically really busy every time i go in but they always have my stuff ready within just a couple days
would definitely recommend them for any of your printing or marketing needs
i was not too happy but they insisted that it would allow them to take some time off so i felt bad and said that would be okay
they told me they would change the charger out but it is not close enough for it to be worth it
he tried changing the network setting from automatic to ltecdma i let him do it then explained i had also played with those settings and found no difference
now we get to take our own little one whos 2 and he loves it too
confirmed for a rip off
the careful move is full service
i would highly recommend anyone shopping and taking classes at her establishment
the owner john did the estimate himself always a good sign
i now use my home printer only for black and white documents
the one thing that i learned from this experience is that trial and error is a necessary part of building a relationship with a housekeeping service
the patrons are nice i just wished they would learn to wipe down the machines after they use them
as a business owner for over 30 years
dont get me wrong i love my mac to death it is just some of its users and employees that i find troubling
i wish they would go around and train other subs
customer service was so friendly and pleasant that i left with a smile on my face before even getting my clothes back
the transport was no problem and the ladies were very happy with their rides
he let me browse when i wanted but was right there when i need more info
this place employs smug and condescending people who apparently like to talk down to customers and will not provide estimates until they have got your clock the oldest trick in the book to spring overinflated repair prices
and then i said well youre not getting an opportunity to fix the other one im taking my business elsewhere because i know better
the guys were on time very pleasant and professional
i had a boatload of dress shirts that i had bought expressly for work and i didnt want to let them languish unused
the service sucks
if youre looking for an experience and not just another haircut i highly recommend this salon
they saved me a bunch of money
so today friday i sited at living room for 4hrs to wait for the driver finally i got my package and it doesnt have to be returned back to the states i hate ups fedx honestly doesnt do any better than ups we dont have much choice
my boyfriend recently shattered his iphone screen and i contacted justin and he remembers us from last time i will be doing business with him again
its hard to find good people these days but actually do the job right and have a great personality as well
do not go
i didnt have to turn anything in
amanda and i really wanted to learn how to work out as in we wanted to learn the machines in the gym how they work what they work out and how to set them to us while also learning good circuit routines
i got a white comforter dry cleaned and while it didnt as clean as i had hoped it was cleaner smelled great and was wrapped up neatly
love his family business  history just like ours
given my stature its really hard for me to find a decent bicycle
i am so grateful i found this little gem in waddell
he called back in a timely manner  very friendly and priced fairly
rep came in wan attitude  measured both rugs said i assume these are synthetic
to my horror i called them quickly thinking it would be an easy fix to pop back in they informed me it would be another 60humm 60 to fix what obv you did a horrible job on
you will not be disappointed
never ever ever will i go back
i am not even worried about scorpions anymore
they get the 5th star back
he is an asset to the company
he had a couple extra custom made brackets sitting in his van that he was able to attach to the tvthat way when we swung the tv on way or the other the soundbar would move seamlessly with the tv
my one negative comment would have to be about the change rooms theyre quite small and could solve their line problem easily if they added a few more
charged 650350 to launder a shirt and 300 for spot treatment
they did my carpet and tiles long time ago
he knew this trip was my one shot to select a diamond in person and design a ring without sarah suspecting anything
that being said if youre on a budget you would do better to find another place
not only did he extend a welcome to me to go out as a solo rider but he accommodated my early morning ride request so i could take a yoga class in las vegas
he cleaned my carpets upstairs and downstairs and also cleaned my tile in my large kitchendining area and it looks brand new
thanks again  john
ive been going there forever and drive 20 min to use what was great service
cool blew did a fantastic job repairing my air conditioner
was so happy with my first visit that i went back with shirts to have fitted with darts
the custom ring process allows you to pick out exactly what you want regarding every aspect of the ring
my head just about exploded
i gladly switched to this shop when it opened up across the street from my condo
i admittedly dont expect much from the usps at this point aside from overpriced and low quality service but this place is seriously in need of an overhaul and at least a security guard
excellent excellent job
this is your place
cant get better service than that
i scheduled 3 different moving companies for quotes and amh underquoted everyone by 1000 so of course we chose them
mark did an awesome job on our tile this morning
the age when it is still fun to get mail since it isnt bills my 2 yr old and my 50 pit came with me for the walkother perk to after hours
i experienced the worst customer service i have ever had at celebrity tailor
i dont want to get anyone in trouble but the fellah who helped me out proved that even apples monstrous support department can have a soul
they always help me with my shipping needs
and pricing is outstanding
there was a cheesy offer to give me half off the labor cost but irepair wanted me to pay full retail to replace the glass again so its my opinion that the glass installed was less than oem and probably not the best quality to break with such a simple procedure so the complete guarantee sucked
meal was ok view was awesome
i booked my appointment and they came out within a timely manner
thank you charity shop ladies
however their drop off service is a different story
which wasnt too big of a deal but then asked how much it was going to cost and was told it would be 17
the neatest thing about the renovation project is the fact that there are so many tryout stations marked with white stools minus the mobile phones kiosk reminds me of the apple stores including the xbox 360 kinect very cool my hubby tried it out of course
as a mother i know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they arent required to have more teachers in the class
the price was amazing and i could have had it repaired the same day had i been in a hurry
her prices are low for what she offers and was very happy with our photos
down down down
on a scale of 1 to 10 id say the tilegrout started at about 4 and ended at about 6  surface dirt was gone but the ground in dirt in the kitchen and a several other areas were still very obvious
pricing isnt outrageous but unless you catch a bigtime sale theres not much here that you cant find elsewhere any more
ok one more star removed for theft
the staff here has worked with my hectic schedule and they take great care of my son
i put together a picture and sent it to al
we decided on a three tier cake  top layer was real while the other two were foam
so it seems the only thing i paid 180 to eliminate was desert sky from my rolodex
when i called their tollfree number i was told that some items have a 14 day return policy whereas other items have a 30 day policy
i may not have been dressed very well but you lost an opportunity
they couldnt remember who they signed in or what they looked like no one kept track of who was helped and who was still waiting
these guys are great
i contacted the manager and he wanted me to remove the screen protector which will not be usable afterwards
for the equivalent of the 65 that fones gone wild was going to charge me all i did was go to the samsung account website where i typed in a couple of personal items and tadah i passed the samsung sign in
they were cheaper than every other place i received a quote from
the price is right and they are fast no bs going on at this cleaners
i emailed the company immediately when i came home highlighting some issue areas but i didnt hear back so i decided to post here as well
the feeling when they hand you your bike back tuned and working 110 is beyond description
i really enjoyed the system they used to update me on the progress of my weapons
his skills and knowledge seemed so limited i asked him if maybe there was someone else i should speak tonope
so i hang up and call back  i was received by a younger boy  who i presumed was her son  when i went to this location in person  might i add he did not have this accent when i met him in person and he was mocking me and speaking to me in a fake british accent  then switching off to his australian accent  he then tried to double the price for my trailer to have my u pod box moved from 1499 to 2999  simply to give me a harder time
they leave their dishes undone stains everywhere and no matter how much i try to clean it it takes way too long for just one person
thoroughly enjoyed myself and have already made a point of telling my son that next time they are up from marietta this is on the things to do list
i come for the east coast originally and built a new house in az about 7 months ago and didnt think the water was as hard as everyone saidwell i was wrong it is worse than what they say
and dont forget to look around in the store its great shop with a vibe that makes you want to hang around after the tour
however the customer service and staff training is lacking at both locations
not really digging the manual labor of a bike well they have the solution here
the owner is an expert in what she does
im glad i found this place for sure
and the office was very accommodating
each time the workmanship has been very good and the prices are fair
they did not wear any type of carpet protection over their shoes until the last hour they were there
these guys pretreated and cleaned my carpet better than the last company i paid 140
i know everyone at this location and everyone is pretty friendly
stephanie knew a lot about it and i m so happy i met her
not my style
made my move from my 3rd story apartment much less stressful
this is a competitive business and i would not recommend any other moving company but just in time moving
this may sound a little strange but one of the things i like best about this place is if they cant do the job right theyll tell you they cant do it instead of doing it jacking it up and charging you for it and leaving you with a mess
probox provided excellent service and quick delivery of a 15 foot standard probox
im so in to zumba so taking the zumba class with albena  or kristy those are the ones i been  theyre  amazing and they have couple classes on different eos so check out witch one is the closes to you and hot hula with teli  she is amazing but sadly she is just in 1 day a week  i  wish they can gave her move classes at eos
i was quoted 79 to have it changed out but when i went to pick it up the genius that worked on it didnt feel comfortable with charging me the 79 so he treated it just like one of the recalled batteries
i knocked my hard drive tower off of the desk
word of advise  stay away
he explained everything along the way giving us nothing but the upmost respect for his ability and knowledge
ive been to a number of different laundromats but this one tops it off
i was wondering about this location since from the outside over the weekend the office building looks closed
i had to get it fixed
ive had help even when those stores were packed
they are excited to help me learn stuff and you get the impression they are happy for anyone who is getting into the pleasure of two wheels
i call cool air now to set up an appt
read the yelp reviews peeps
the band was defective and the manufacturer for some reason could not replace the band
i wont go anywhere else
after speaking with the person for 10 mins he put me on hold and i was transferred back to the menu
roy and andy worked on an extremely hot day they were professional polite and took the time to answer any questions i had in the operation of the system
the cemetery itself is very serene with beautiful grass luscious trees fountains benches and beautiful columbariums
he had a handy magnetic screwdriver and he laid all the screws out like a jigsaw puzzle knowing exactly where to put them back
even though they didnt have the speaker parts for an iphone 6s at the shop he went out of his way and switched out my defected iphone part with his own
we will definitely use him in the future when we have need for such services
they will deny damaging any of the things you drop off and tell you that you damaged it
there was no hive like one sees in trees or plants etc
if it takes you time to drive across the town then do it
my kids can work out right alongside of me
it is fixed and he was kind enough to give me suggestions on how to keep it running smooth
the lady gave us the first janky trailor and didnt even check the tires before we left
if you want to testdrive a car we drove two be prepared to wait several minutes while they find another carjockey and start moving cars around to get your pick out
needless to say im not happy with this store right now
its totally worth the long drive to get to her
they also replaced the carpet on our main level and they were very professional courteous prompt and honest
we went to affordable flooring based off everyones yelp reviews and i couldnt thank yelp enough for introducing us to this business
when you initially called your tone of voice was highly agitated because i complained to sam sung about your service and you know that buy rite appliances has several complaints that were  made and not resolved by others at las vegas bbb
go to a tailor go to espinosa master tailors
tonight i waited for 2 hrs and 6 mins before the line was disconnected
i have worked with alex a few times in referring him to my clients
it was a bad experience for me
i called this guys on 7pm they show up 45 min after they were very professional they replaced my springs the job was done in 45 minutes and i was so satisfied i will defiantly recommend them and will use them again
damaging other components and denying responsibility
are you kidding me
he is so laid back and casual exactly the kind of guy youd like to have a beer and watch the game with
im new to the area just moved and recently hired kimberlys house cleaners to clean the house we moved into which was absolutely filthy
my husbandand i would highly revommend him
still no call
website doesnt work and yes they are listed on ripoffcom
i had three shirts altered quick and done well but the lady lost a pair of my pants and had no excuse nor did she offer to reimburse me for the loss
fedex is definitely more organized
and when they returned the dry cleaning they gave me a purple laundry bag for future pick ups
i have passed bret and sonorans name on to many people and will continue to do so
thank you guys
if you are currently enrolled please take them out
avoid on track at all costs if you want the package to be delivered
too much work for them obviously
granted extra time had already been put in so she could tackle the pit of despair the was my oven but i went for an extra hour to get more done because both the wok done was great and i had gotten the membership deal where each hour was 5 less
anyway id recommend for a fast convenient stop if you know what you want and if its fairly popular
i have been to so many dry cleaners over the years and pierpont is by far the best
the young guy at the shipping counter has caused me more grief the last few times going in there and today drove me to leave this review
the groomer was so nice when i checked him in she asked several questions about the haircut after agreeing on the style she said will do it and have him ready in 4 hrs
hands down my favorite cobbler
i asked them to service my ice dispenser
thank you reddi for employing such honest caring employees
i recommend this location to everyone who needs a fingerprint card
first electrician shows up and is unable to even locate the junction box where the short is occurring
the property was a first floor condo
they nailed it with their white glove service
he also helped me a lot with adjusting the size ratio of my poster
i spent 60 on getting my ipod repaired and there wasnt much of a difference
the crew was friendly and clean
i love this place
sign me up
they were very helpful in what it needed and how to treat it for little ones
when they said they dont warranty the watch if they break it if theyre valued over 100 i told them i thought that was an odd policy
i would highly recommend his company for banners and signs big and small
this place was totally worth the drive
i brought in a bike tire for repair because new tubes kept going flat
highly recommended unless you are a warlock
i rarely give companies 5 star reviews but cranmore proved to be the exception
berall standen bedienungen herum haben ihr schwtzchen gehalten und keine kam auf die idee mir ihre hilfe anzubieten
i did the obvious troubleshooting checked tstat batteries looked for loose wires confirmed fan  heat worked but ac didnt checked all breakers  fuses
i was foolish to let this happen four times
after he shined up the tile cleaned our carpets and washed the windows our house looked like it had never even been lived in
in addition dan has been very helpful with questions weve had for referrals to finish other details on our home
i was wrong
i like fishers because they use a bait  spray that is non toxic so you dont need to leave your place for hours or take everything out of your cabinets
the staff is super friendly and accommodating
i love the class he is in with lidiya and wafa
wow we saw the computers that they said wasnt available here in las vegas
they were very generous with their time and very responsive when we kept on asking for quotes for different paper quality and invitation amounts
the support notice continued to tell me that my service would be restored at 5 at 630 i checked back into my account and the notice had changed to account temporarily suspended   wtf
its your fault for buying a broken dishwasher
we found one dead scorpion next day and nothing since
i thought for sure this was going to be a quick trip
found a used pair of ear plugs sitting on a shelf in the room which made me question the cleanliness
if youre looking for friendly professional and thorough service this is the place
then all they do is fast talk and back pedal
would we use dinos again
suggestion why not text back using technology and like restaurants of when a technician is ready
jim was honest about the job and what it would entail from the start
ive been quite a bit now on both wed and sat
i like the selection and hours of this store however a lot of the items here are over priced ive seen many things at walmart brand new for the same price this store sells used items that doesnt make any sense
they are amazing thank you tucker
for much of  my 30 year career as a health and safety professional i have worked in a petrochemical facility whose hourly workers were represented by a union
give me a break
the wife processed the paperwork while the husband had us follow up back to unhook the trailers
so when i contacted them about what i had wanted the owner understood what i wanted and was precise about everything
if you are like me i totally depend on my laptop for everything and feel totally lost without it
our move was scheduled for saturday the 18th
there was a 30 service fee but what company doesnt charge a fee for showing up at your door
i have placed orders at the last minute and their delivery service is spot on and they delivered on time
we highly recommend this company
the 2400 spent for a life time warranty is no longer valid
i recently discovered oneclick cleaners and am so happy that i did
i had these guys move me when they are were first getting started and they were wonderful so i wanted to use them again big mistake
at one time i would enthusiastically recommended first impression to my friends and neighbors
its been 1 year since i transferred  here from a la petite in madison wi and i have to say that i couldnt be happier about my decision to move here
if you have a pest problem call beewise pest control
i wanted to ride and i trusted that the mechanics had chosen what they did for good reason
we bought a day pass and tried to fit as much in as we could but unfortunately the trip was cut short by a lightening storm
id recommend them to anyone needing screen repair
overall a cool experience
honestly they are better than apple with my experiences
best jeweler ever
this is the printing place that saves students universities lawyers and a slew of other random small businesses on a daily basis
she refused to acknowledge anything i had to say
we had them come out again to install an ro unit that we had purchased online
i am a happy customer and i will definitely use their service again
this was a very stressful move for them and for us not able to be a part of it
again i cant say enough how great and professional she is in helping me to enjoy my time in montreal
as well a piece of our headboard was separated from the rest of the bed making it useless to us
in addition to our pest problems having been completely solvedtheir prices are great and the owner and his staff are just genuinely nice and trustworthy people
i felt that was high for just a hem but i hadnt been anywhere else and had no idea what the market rate for wedding dress alterations were
i decided on a groupon for a the 11x85 landscape book for 40 pages
they even lend you a bike to use until they get your bike done
they took all of my furniture boxes and bags to my new apartment safely and soundly
had to take off several hours of work because my wife refused to be there
awesome atmosphere and super friendly staff
i was asked to inspect and i did have them to vacuum one of the rooms and the stairs and still was substandard
i am the director of hotel operations at a hotel in the chandler area
i came to pom on the recommendation of my make up artist
the store manager or the manager on duty eric was very rude with a disgusting attitude
then she harshly to my friend maybe this isnt the gym for you and you need to go somewhere else
i went to the store and my wife waited for them
this company wrapped my restaurant van and did a horrible job
i was greatly impressed with the quality of work and the affordability
maybe you should take another look at what your customers are saying here and instead of replying with indignant sarcasm find out how you can save a customer and make it right
its tile so im not sure what you were trying to vacuum
great customer service
jim gave me a price on the phone he was on time and very knowledgable
this is one of those places that you walk out of when done and go wow that was easy
awesome friendly and knowledgable service
rather than get into a new contract with a company i was already disappointed with i came here first and foremost they were very knowledgable
not bad but not good either
the price we paid was exactly what we were quoted
i hate their pricing system
i didnt really want anything other than my yard mowed
in the last couple months we have turned away many pest companies that have knocked on our door
just another used one of course and he didnt even charge for the time he had spent trying to figure out what was wrong with the first one even though it was technically used and in no way under any guarantee
this place needs at least two more employees and better customer service
would highly recommend
the accidents are always well documented and treated accordingly
came back today to have it fixed again and they told us that they would have to charge another 200 to fix it and there wasnt any warranty to their screens etc
the work was completed the next day and they were extremely professional
he was so courteous professional and nice person
agent was unable to help me saying only that the pending service order may have something to do with it
its too bad because its closest to my home and i would rather support business nearby
general admission for ages 199 is 12
but is that why every light in the house was left on
i ordered chicken marsala
theyre very friendly with the kids
i will keep going there as long as it is open
my mom has been ill and in frail condition so i help everywhere i can
unfortunately something has changed with stanley steamer   ive been using them for eons and always professional great cleaning  staff
after a while until i couldnt wait any longer i asked if anyone was coming to assist me then they sent a man to assist me after a few more minutes
grateful for the hospitality and genuine spirits of the people of this area
steve did an incredible job cleaning the carpet in my living room and master bedroom
i visited your store on march 21 2016 and found a refrigerator that worked
this company has some of the best customer service i have seen in a long time
combine it with a great design and your business will flourish from great prints alone
sean and jose are the best people to deal with
they also noted my account to insure that contractor is never sent to my home again
i would definitely refer his company to my friends thank you so much
they had been sitting on my counter for months needing to be taken care of
they had everything done in two weeks and my dresses fit perfectly

the prices are reasonable and a few of the girls even remember my name even though im not in all that often
she didnt acknowledge us until we said excuse me can we order after being there about 10 minutes just standing at the counter
my wife and i have been using maidpro for over 3 years now and love the service
wife and i were pleased with the overall cleanliness and speed
i have always had the best experience here
thanks to elite av putting in an awesome wifi system in my house every corner of my house has an awesome wifi signal that works perfect
steve and brandon have both been to my house to spray and they have always been very courteous prompt and professional and i havent seen any critters around since they started spraying my place last year
had a crack in my windshield from a rock on the freeway
i called their phone number and talked to daisy who im told is rauls wife who told me she would call him to see what the problem was and call me back
the repairman was on time and did a great job
even worse whatever was on these clothes made me itch like crazy
so to recap e  j seems to be a company that lacks in communication and a commitment to customer service they do not take ownership of their work and they erroneously charge you without providing any form of recourse for dissatisfied customers
each store is a little different as far as pricing and organization
when i picked up the suit he was attentive while i ensured the fit was correct and pointed out key areas
i decided i wanted to go microwave my food a little more
i did not need jennaleigh to alter my gown or steam it
i highly recommend this school
they do what they say they are going to do at a reasonable price
his work is fantastic and was completed quickly
they even told me they had my information written down
my washing machine pump was clogged and need to be drained
ryan showed us how to use it and was very easy to work with
called on thursday then bill and jason showed up on friday morning at 8am with a big truck no waiting
there are convenient saturday hours but it closes at 1 pm so get here early
pet stains removed too with low water process
this establishment is the best mortuary service is las vegas nevada
11 disk network streaming hidef tv
i will absolutely use them for all of my computerrelated issues from now on and if i ever leave madison i may fly back just to have them fix my stuff
seriously look no further
he asked about particular pest invasions
can you believe that
thats good leadership
no customer service
we called yesterday and was told giovanni was working on it still
hes always taken good care of me and my phones
i am thrilled with the service i received here
the next week i came in to pick up the suit
steve came out and was able to find the problem in just a few minutes
i will use you again  i am already spreading the word about you please keep up the good work  never lower your service standards     too bad yelp site didnt give me the option to upload my great pix
i also love feeling like im stepping into a community space when i walk in
very friendly staff
i dropped my phone off at noon and they had it done in a jiffy 44 minutes
needless to say we are extremely pleased with the results and service
the hair never grew back and he was left with scars from it
this place totally sucks im going somewhere else
so i called and spoke to someone yesterday and to help and they told me to log in and reply to all of the reviews so i did and i politely told each person that they needed to write a review for the business in their state
brian and keith are amazing
incredible customer service and really clean facilities
this is the reason best buy is no longer a choice for many
i seriously doubt any one other than the repair guy could tell you the difference between a humbucker and a potentiometer
they practice reading and writing develop their mathcritical thinking skills social studies scientific thinking development personal work habits and social development
i got it back and it was quite clear they did not hand press it it had all the telltale signs off being thrown onto a cheap shirt machine with no care or attention paid whatsoever
thank you quality alterations
go on a nonweekend day things are calmer there and you wont have to wait a million years for a change stall
anytime fitness is the alternative and unless you dont mind being on display for the whole world to see this isnt the place for you in the evening
they had me in and out before i knew it
i had a very good experience with black diamond mechanical
they even call and give a heads up if she is having a rough day
i received both watches one day after mailing him payment
thanks for your beautiful functional design your enlightened business model sharing your inspiring story with the world and a great night sleep
they always have it ready by pick up
if i were you i would ask for scott
i met a very cool vietnamese lady and the lady behind the counter was super cool given how busy they were at the time is awesome
only issue i think are major are the remotes
hearing that this was part of their treatment when they would come out i was happy to pay more for their service
i highly recommend services here
there is nothing they would do to help me and now im stuck for another two years
my next jewerly purchase will be with summerlin jewelers
once i finally spoke to a representative she continued to apologize for the long hold and proceeded to reschedule the inspection
they also have a wide variety of accessories and bikes at reasonable prices
call them first with you key or lock situation
i found out by reading the news on break at work
i dont write reviews very often but when i do its only because ive had amazing customer service
thank you american cleaners
bought laptop from alex and was impressed with his no nonsense style
they have every wheel ive ever needed
i brought it in and grace went over the whole thing with me noting every spot
actually i wouldnt recommend this location to anyone
there is so much better than this place out there
the functional zippers are on the inside part of the boot
so i was already upset over that
darnell is probably the main reason why this business does well
we had our initial workout with him and the next day i could feel every single muscle
they work was top quality the service was speedy and the customer service was top notch
main course was bland homemade sauce lacked flavor and taste like it was from a can if i could give this place no stars i would
we just purchases our first home and they made sure to thoroughly explain everything we needed to know regarding services and nearby pest
he never tried to pressure me into buying more than what i needed
i was headed up north for a quick weekend camping trip and needed some firewood for the trip
when i handed over my phone to the service techs i simply just needed my cracked screen fixed
thenwe placed another order of meat a coke and 2 bowls of rice
would highly recommend him and his company to anyone
the parking is well laid out and the entrances and exits will get you to either road in either direction safely
parking is ok along the back theres about 9 spots
they even shined my heels and they look brand new
our move consisted of furniture we took apart and plastic wrapped ourselves i didnt know they do it before putting it in the truck and boxes of our apartment
so far we have seen very little activity and we are super happy with the service
worst company ever and i have no idea how they arent shut down
when i shared how upset i was with the entire process and that i should have listened to ryans post on yelp and that without a refund i would share my experience on yelp
there is even carpet in the bathroom
so when youre exiting quickly switch to the left lane and brick works will be right there
as a woman i find that taking my car in for any kind of work even a simple oil change is about as fun of an experience as going to the dentist
no thank you
we ended up moving from a smaller unit to a larger one and it was a smooth transition throughout
when i picked up my shirts today they were perfect
he just downright a good guy to do business with
my wife had a simple pair of birkenstocks and just needed the buckle fabric stitched
we will definitely use this place again if needed
with absurd policies like this along with the entirely indifferent attitude these guys are just begging to go out of business for the second time
yea actually you told me i could not purchase my own
when we got to the condo we discovered that the fridge was not working
they didnt even have the decency to wait 6 months and i have 2 units  that was painful  so i would recommend find a company that offers a contract not a raise your rate at will with this company
the diamond in my ring is not loose and has been secure for many years
i brought in the nicer dress pants to sew again because i love these pants
awesome experience all here in one building on two floors
plenty of folding tables and wheelie baskets
i asked him about the fan which which i suspected had not been working then he told me that the fan didnt work at all
on time efficient nice and attentive and the price is extremely reasonable
overall i couldnt be more pleased with the service i told him we wanted to add in ceiling speakers to the master bedroom and he got me a quote back with labor and parts in less than a day
i went back to the shop and asked if she could research her records plus the receipt was marked paid
hello but the cost i was quoted for the pads was 750 each
such a helpful employee wish i had caught her name
i felt that it was a red flag that the store had defective parts but went back against my better judgement the next day because of the proximity and convenience of the location
brian and his crew at sir grout are great
these guys came knocking recently with their pitch about we service all your neighbors etc i explained that i was not interested in service but the guy persisted
i was contacted repeatedly by this company even though i said i was not interested
the shop itself is a bit older but clean and organized
from hanging huge wood slab from the ceiling as a dining room table incorporating a pop up tv in the kitchen island to creating a custom wine cellar underneath the stairwell  they never said no or it wasnt possible
prompt courteous and more important than all skilled in their craft you cant beat kendall plumbing
upon entering the store you got a more intimate feel rather than a kind of costco feel with other jewelry storesdidnt feel overwhelmed  i think they did that intentionally to put you at ease a little bit
the next day i spoke to the owner who both her and her employee demonstrated their ability to lie
surprisingly this came at no cost
i said no they are as big as closets
i really loved the customer service
i figured if this thing has lasted as long as it has without incident why not stick with the same brand
roger and rose
its nice to know that any money you spend having fun here goes to support a good charitable cause
she answered all of my questions on the phone and dispatched the plumber right away
my husband was not a happy guy upon leaving but when i told him that all the money goes to opportunity village and then explained the charity he was more forgiving
i needed someone to do a password removal for a decent price
second time was on a friday and we needed a rush delivery for monday
i highly recommend these guys
delia was very clean prompt and professional
these guys do a fabulous thorough job
when i called to inquire about notary services she rudely repeated several times that she was the only person there and that i would have to bring witnesses
one time they did not even knock or ring the bell
they also made it easy to deal with the insurance company
hes a great designer and will come up with ideas that you didnt think of
the guy said it woul be 8000 to replace the screen and they would call me in 4 hours to pick it up
why should i have to wait because of their screw up
i am not normally a review writer but i felt compelled to write this after the experience we had
the other items were cleaned satisfactorily though i would have liked them starched a bit more
to enhance my features
and theyre open saturdays until 2pm
unlike your traditional jewelers which has a store front that has customers coming in and out and you need to wait on your turn this place is all about you
i am disgusted and its been so stressful that it has taken me this long to sit down and send feedback
i kept pushing off wallmounting my tv for the past three years
i a bridesmaid just spent over 3 hours today at veras with my friend the bride who may be one of the most indecisive people i know and we had a great experience with our consultant holly where decisions were made
how nervewracking when the temperature outside is 20 degrees and you know that your furnace has stopped working
im not sure how much they saved me
ive been going to tonys for years now and it wasnt until recently i finally had it up to here and found another dry cleaner
they cleaned my dress and burned the arm then tried to cover it up
i often buy online to save myself a headache and wait a day to pick up here which is a nice option
good prices free advice and friendly honest service
2 nervous parents from the united states who insisted on helping out and who they treated with the utmost patience and kindness and  a potential time limitation relating to the elevator at the new apartment complex that was not booked properly
they couldve easily charged me the original quoted price
however the majority of that time my husband is working in the office and i am the primary care giver
make sure they have been in business for a wile and make sure you have good communications with them
seeing my daughter smiling the whole time was peace of mind for me
want to take it off and try side stones instead
so i called the number back since its a recorded phone line and have a supervisor reviewing the call will update to let you all know what happens
rita is amazing
why do they use plastic bags and why wouldnt they just reuse the hangers i brought my clothes on
i decided to replace my ac unit and began researching products
they called back two days later
if i have any issues with pests in the future these are the guys i will trust
i had to take it to a second jeweler who also said it was an enhanced ring
double talk this place
stumbled upon az furniture repair in a yelp searchglad i did
they did a great job and they also were extremely professional and respectful
i called and talked to josh and he was so nice and accommodating
i dont need a plumber or electrician
very professional and friendly
willing to work with you within reason
no question i will be using other ff services in the future
quick and and friendly crew
will be back more for sure
meaning for example  i took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff but he seamed them up to look exactly the way they were when i first bought them
wish there were more people like mo
first day i come in the lady takes my watch in knowing that there is an end cap missing
a few years ago we were in a focus group for shortys rescue pit boss
i used to spend a lot of money in staples
ive given them till 1021 to either repair or replace unit
it took one business day and it was finished
its not bad enough they left behind a ton of stuff and that my 78yo mother who is having pacemaker surgery this friday is right now on her 9th hour of packing and lifting boxes into 2 trucks with all the stuff they left behind
when i asked how i could pay they said cash only which was not specified on the coupon
if you want printing on the sleeve make sure to specify it in the notes section on the back of your design and specify the specifics of the location and size of the printing on the sleeve
and they are very fast with the repairs
i picked up her remains and they gave me a nice little frame with my cats hair clippings with a nice poem
im convinced the positive reviews are written by the company itself
they seemed to pack everything with care and somewhat efficiently
i wish they had the part in stock though thanksgiving cooking would have been much easier
prof  early arrive
use to be a great cleaners
however the people here are trying wayyyyyy too hard to play the part of the indifferent artsy type
love this place
they know me when i come in the door
it was already out of warranty from where i purchased it from
summer rain was a vibrant fruity mix and the porta cocoa is a chocolatenoted heavy dessert wine with a ton of complex flavors
front door is often left open i walked in my first week 3 times with no one at the front desk and door wide open
overall i feel that theres no incentive to come to this store over a competitor
es hat 9 euro gekostet
howd he know to bring it out to me
very quick nice and informative
the jeweler who i dealt with came out and said no i meant 2495 each
in and out in less than five minutes with just what we needed
not only were they near our storage but we look inside our storage and find bed bugs on our brand new couch clothes and on the floor
the last service call we had was performed by benjamin sykora and he was pleasant thorough and respectful
i left it at home today and got really sad when i was driving away
i tried sending an international package out for christmas they charged almost 200 to send it
very pleased with his service justin came the same day and on time that was scheduled
she was so nice and got right to work
two weeks later my phone got a little water damaged
the 2 nd guys estimate was almost dbl what the 1st guys wasi pulled out the 1st estimate and he didnt know what to saybut assured me his was the rock bottom price he could charge before he seen itwheres the honesty
the oliver piano made it to las vegas all the way from mom and dads house in lindsay ca
if you need any work done on your barbecue give them a call it looks like a new unit once they are done with it in fact i think it works better now than when we had it installed 10 years ago i will recommend them to all that need grills cleaned or worked on
the owner mike amber and trina are wonderful
the quality of the water throughout my house is excellent
i think he got told that i complained becuase i got a few bucks off the dolly rental that i hadplus he was in a much better mood this time
do not support this company
jeremy jones has helped a few of my business associates get published and they are super pleased with the results
ill definitely recommend bee wise to anyone that i know
i just assumed it was the price of doing business
fast forward to today 79 my boyfriend spoke to daniel last night and he was available to meet today at the sellers home all the way out in goodyear at noon short notice
that was awesome
they knew this was a tiffanys ring before hand it was discussed very blatantly but no one informed us that this would be an accurate raw material appraisal
my bike looked beautiful
i was so surprised and relieved i shouldve left him a tip in hindsight but i know that i will return when i encounter a problem with my phone again
in the future please tell people you can only do limited fixes and train your techs better
i had belsitos plumbing come out and take a look and they did a thorough inspection but did not find any issues  and hence did not charge me
their customer service is great along with their pricing and turnaround
i heard of robs business through word of mouth and the work he completed really shows his professionalism
the store was neat and clean though slightly empty and picked over
the woman is a miserable person
i had a couple pieces that really needed some love and care especially my black clothes since i have 2 cats that shed quite a bit but i thought its a professional company everything will be immaculate when it comes back
points add up quick
i will not come here or recommend them again
they have about 20odd treadmills so theres always little or no wait
higinio did an awesome job installing our new water heater
i called and was informed the truck broke down and they were about 20 minutes away
i asked why this had not been discovered the day before when the diagnostic was run and the guy said he didnt know
i finally found a awesome spot
i could buy nice new ones for that price in fact world market has great ones for less
phone number disconnected with no referral number
i am not going to pay you a few thousands of dollars more to replace the compressor
pls change mgmt because location is convenient
i got a screen with a folder that had a question mark in it once it was bad
they told us we would have to drive back tomorrow and finish the setup there
so when youre going there during rush hour you might have to park on the side of the road
given that i spent a couple thousand dollars at best buy two computers over the past six months plus i am a rewards member i guess i was expecting too much
i have not actually used  az but would have liked to after having spoken to the friendly and very helpful owner when i called to book an appointment
she will take care of you and will make sure you are happy with the result
she is honest with her opinions on what work needs to be done which i appreciate
for almost ten years i have trusted carlton cleaners with all my precious clothes that i cant wash myself
i believe i needed them next day which they were able to do but i had to have my mil pick them up due to my work schedule
she even added elastic to the straps to keep them up and pinned some of the bust to help it lay better without charging extra
and the price is right
my phone was fixed right in front of me with wonderful conversation the whole time
absolutely the worse
first beck couldnt be a nicer guy
called george based on his awesome yelp reviews to see if he had an knowledge of the brand
great mechanic passionate about his work very reasonable costs was able to fix a problem with my old mazda that two other shops cant specializes in old lowvalue cars
the other 23 of the store is actually an artscraft center and a childcare playspace
now im the bad guy
these ladies do an outstanding job with sewing repair jobs and drycleaning
today he chose to tell me the next clerk would be with me and began to wrap clothes
i received a notice of fine and court fee for the ticket that the parking ticket guys did not end up attending
another person came as well and same thing
i had a half finished car audio installation and my car interior was trashed
i will never recommend your company despite the fact that the tech was pleasant and seemed helpful
much better experience
that is the true test of quality customer service
the first time i came to vegas i was astounded of the number of high end watch stores
i now have someones left handed golf clubs a 6 ft ladder instead of my 8 ft someones walking cane
id highly reccomend the service you get here from the friendly staff
without those elements the bike was not what we were looking for
they did a great job reupholstering 4 oak chairs that had old fabric
some shops will screw you in the ass when it comes to labor fees  one in peoria ive been to charges for how long the bike is in the shop
the first one i tried melted the adhesive from the velcro patches on the sleeves all over the shirts and couldnt remove it
a few months later had to call them again because rodents still heard on roof and in ducts
he refused to refund my money leaving me with an illegal used scuffed 100 replica louis vuitton mini bag
its one of a kind but there was no compassion when i called to report it
im sorry a firearm does not grow legs and walk away
we only used 76 but somehow we were charged for 152 when we called them they said they would take care of the charge
so sad gotta find a new cleaner
they gave me a quote on the phone which the two super friendly and professional techs  benja  anselmo repeated as soon as they got here
he can assess the mechanical aspects of a watch and provide a quick solution with a very agreeable cost
our 1 year old has been with them for 2 months now
the food was very kid friendly and reasonable price wise
they are organic and use no harsh chemicals which is great for my sensitive skin
it was really cool to see people actually making unique pieces in the back room and to get to meet the designer that personal interaction went a long way toward making me feel more confident about the whole process
he was very friendly and had the job done in under 15 minutes
the burger looks good
i thought my carpets were done until robert came and spent nearly 45 hours on them
rather than be so vigilant on yelp and eyeing your business reviews like a hawk lame easy to complain about customer response afterthefact get in the damn store and take care of your customers inperson price your products fairly and for the love of gosh be nice to people when they are actually spending their time in your business and spending their hardearned money to support your livelihood
this wasnt cheap
i dont really go to dry cleaners often as well i dont really buy many dry clean only clothes but after being matron of honor at a wedding and after having the best man hand me a drink that proceeded to spill onto my dress on purpose
professional knowledgeable and friendly
6 months ago i brought in my 3 year old laptop that would shutdown randomly due to overheating for repair
he was also very accommodating to my busy schedule and asked me when i would like him to come do the repair
the only complaint i would have is that they wrapped furniture and it took a little extra time even though i told them i did not need it my furniture is old
he said that it will cost 300 to restock the phone essentially the amount i paid for
great teachers safe and loving atmosphere
the cart when available requires ear protection to ensure the 45271db it outputs do not cause your ear drums to rupture
to my surprise they also fixtake broken printers old computers and apple computers
carpets came out great
each one came at the price you would expect to pay if you got a good deal on craigslist but was top quality with no crapware or any of the problems you risk with buying hardware online
on the day of installation they got right to work
good games in the back and enough to keep you and a kid entertained for the duration
i have been to the store a few times to purchase a macbook phone charger an apple tv and to have my ram upgraded
i also wanted hebrew writing on my invites every single invitation online that had hebrew was corny
i dropped off a watch here that i had bought at macys
we have been with green mango for a year now and we absolutely love them
for business i am usually there at least once a week for ipads ipods or other
he fixed the crack on my ipad and dropped it off at my house so that i didnt have to wait for him to fix it
when our things finally arrived their was only one mover that came the driver
the lens was squeaky and it decided to stop zooming and make crunching noises until it worked again 5 minutes later
i assumed the previous owners didnt bother having anything done with bugscrittersinsects
the shop is quaint and the stock is carefully curated so its easy to find whatever technological solution required and its likely to be elegant too
we found our new go to guy when we need appliance repairs done
i like the idea that you can try them all out before getting something you like
we learned about anthonys watch  jewelry repair and decided to visit them
a great operation
example today i was returning shoes in original box to amazon and they commented that i should put it in a packing boxenvelope so the return box does not get damaged and possibly not accepted upsale
wont be surprised when the nevada state contractors board revokes their license
it looks and runs as good as new
would go back to this store anytime
he did just that
2 its fun watching people talk back in disgust to the now serving everybody else but you
did a great job and fixed quickly
i cant stress enough how happy i am with their work
as a consumer the most important component in dealing with a business where asymmetry of information may exist is trust in the service provider
he promises hell have it done the next day around the same time hell call when its finished
first experience with a self storage company  it was definitely the worst
also all there benchmade knives were way over priced
where should i begin  if i could give negative stars i would but since yelp does not allow that they get 1 star
he said i would be receiving a tracking number in a few days
i had emphasized the importance of the flower girls tossing purple petals to honor my husbands grandmother who passed away four months ago
somehow in the middle of the night a circuit breaker that is just for the stove crazy right
firstly to dry clean a shirt is 650
she moved to the 23 year old class a few months after her 2nd birthday
thank you again
we have nothing up on the house
so five stars for truth in service and not just taking someones cash even if you cant do the job
this was followed up with a thorough cleaning and raking
and change coils and he sat down cleaned my mod and changed the coils for me without asking
in the meantime they arrived around six or six thirty
my mom enjoyed it so much she kept leaving my sister and i behind
the dispatcher semipolitely disinterested and apathetic at best took my info informed me of a general timeframe and said to stay inside until i got a call from the cab when they were out front
only took 20min
i dont live super close to there and i shouldnt have to go back because they have old locks
if i knew how to hang cabinets this would be my store
beautiful prints and gift items here
some tips there is no cafe or cafeteria
from setting up the appointment to the actual cleaning zerorez was friendly  professional
quality was superb staff was actually knowledgable unlike any kinkos or anything wouldnt trust anybody else with my projects
thanks again lynn for your outstanding customer service
all stains were out and lifted
my phone suffered water damage and was rebooting itself every 5 mins or so but otherwise everything was working no blue screens or error messages
will continue to order from bobbies flowers
ive been several times and have recommended it to lots of people
the next week i follow his directions
so im going to have to spend more money just to get it home
after several phone calls including one to mark at corporate i was at my wits end and ready to give up
mike is awesome
i went here once so that i could have my portfolio bound
he hooked up our stereo system to our built in speakers
we have the full service  pool and landscaping
laundered shirts are 280 and mens suits are 1600
phil and his helper picked up the piano and took it to the showroom
i said if time permits the kitchen and then the living room
j2 cleaning called me back within the next hour and was able to accommodate me
i personally find it offensive
this to complement linhs excellent tailoring skills make them a winner in my book
marcia the owner of sew creative is sew gifted when it comes to perfect alterations
told them the requirements clearly
im super happy to have contacted them for a banner print
it has now been one month since wayne has been at our house and they still have not called us back
we even got name brand carpet and it looks great
they were prompt and quick
customer service is awesome
unfortunate location choice for this business
they were prompt professional and very involved in doing a great job
not happy with this place at all my boyfriend bought two board games there scattegories  monopoly scattegories was missing the letter dice  monopoly was missing a whole set of cards  had a hair tie inside and a couple of other random things shouldnt they check their games before selling them
ive never seen my bike so clean
we were in need of a shower repair with a leak somewhere in the shower wall as well as a fantastic fan repair
took a few garments into this cleaners specified dry clean only on my denim about 3 times to make sure they knew how important it was
the owner helped me decide on a perfect bike for my husband
the fact that i gave the pebble marketplace ups one starand this location three stars shows that i take customer service seriously
these days thats hard to find
our tax dollars hard at work
this place is a pretty basic gym
so many friendly workers every where i looked
i needed my text messages from my phonethey helped me quickly and price was reasonable
it took 2 minutes to drop them off and 2 minutes to pick them up
must see in town
if you want your ceiling fan fixed right the first time call these guys
this seemed odd so i asked the guy if hoover sent the canister vacuum also
my iphone fell out of my purse and of course the screen shattered
my favorite dry cleaning in the area
dont do business with this company
maybe i feel bad after giving the north scottsdale location a 2 star review so im upgrading and giving this one another star  since weve moved jared has been sending his shirts and suits to this location
lol  merry christmas to the postal workers and have a happy new year
i would like to say that my experiences with a to z rental have been second to none
convenient if you can plan ahead  needed in an emergency and they came through w good service
so yeah for tsa purposes this seems like a good location
i appreciate the follow up and dedication to customer service
that is nothing against the teachers themselves
he quoted us ahead of time 55 for my husbands camry 75 for my bmw with extra attention on my dirty wheels
omg there were 50 of them to try and the keys provided failed to work in a single box
dont we all wish that was the way every other company was
it took me a few hours before i was finally able to contact gayle the man in charge
they scheduled an appt promptly and the gentleman who came was spot on time super friendly and was quite wonderful with our dogs
i have used the postal system for decades
dylan always does a good jobthorough inside and out
ginos shoe repair at kamms corners is infinitely better if youre willing to drive out to the west side
only cost 2
i recommend bringing your own sharpieink pen and tape because they do not have any available and its kind of expensive there
i schlepped the box to the checkout counter and was told that it was not  3899 but actually 5399   a significant increase
this business has permanently lost my business for good
i drove all the way across town in rush hour traffic to basically teach someone who calls themselves a  gunsmith the difference between a yankee hill free float tube and a standard delta ring assyi even had to explain what an ar 15 barrel nut shim is and what its use for
so i lived with it for about 6 months
i called at 415 and rather than putting me off and telling me to come in tomorrow clinton squeezed me in right before he closed at 5 he was very professional quick and affordable
virisus are not our responsability
i can get my bike fixed and have coffee and a scone while i wait
just knocking it down a star after taking my favourite dress here with specific instructions to get out some stains
nice professional guys
glad a lowes worker recommended this store when they didnt carry the part i needed
i enjoyed that i got a reminder when my item was ready
its in a busy area etc
he said luckily no
i walk around a lot and prob reach a max of 6 months each pair but at some point i do have to maintain and replace the rubber tips
about a week later i pop the plastic off only to discover theres dust under the glass and he cracked the corner of the glass when installing it
i typically dont write reviews but i just had the best phone call with a mg  e representitive i had to come and rave about it
we called colby and he came to our house the next day to assess the issues we were having
guess it wasnt a big job because my boots had polish on them the owner said he used italian polish on it last year
make your website more userfriendly to me it feels like its intentionally useless so that you have to pay their designers for the work
i cant say enough about how prompt they responded and how kind they were to fit us in the very same day
i came down to check periodically as i hadnt intended to leave him unsupervised in my home
weve been using bulwark exterminating for over ten years in 3 different homes in the valley
while they couldnt accommodate that they were able to arrange backto back massages of 45 minutes each for 150 total
the cleaning was fast and successful and the carpet smells and looks great
obviously those come at a higher price
i am breaking my own rule here which is that i only rate places that earn at least 3 stars because i dont bother returning to a place that rates lower
amazing customer service and great work
we were helped by the same guy both days he was very knowledgeable and friendly
if you use them then hopefully youll have a better experience than i did
just stopped in this week for another one for the office
i dread coming here
never having done boudoir pictures before my adventure started with a warm welcoming personal call from susan
honestly my only complaint is that they charged an extra 3 if you pay by credit card
i would highly recommend them
they gave me back my phone in working condition and apologized for my having to return to the store multiple times and even promised me of my request for a full refund if my phone breaks again
alfonso did a great job taking care of our electrical needs
i do recommend this daycare  ive never been disappointed
ive never been charged for dropping my child off 20 minutes early or changing from a tuesday to a wednesday without having scheduled it
i received a phone call on monday from the plumber asking if i was home and that they were at my house i then called the company and told them i was not supposed to be scheduled until tuesday
it was like pay me and get the f out of here
not the type of business you want to have to work with usually however it does happen and you will be so glad to work with the staff here
brought it back and they wouldnt repress it without me paying for it
this is the only daycare that provides a morning and afternoon preschool program
i couldnt believe my eyes when i walked in as they have so many items and theres literally no wall space untouched
i printed the postage at home so it was simply a matter of getting my package into the box at the po so it went out as soon as possible
this is not something the family should have to deal with
the beer list is impressive too but avoid the nodajito it tastes like pine sol
we have had the unit for a few weeks with no issues and saving space in the fridge where the brita used to be
he told me and another young lady that the laundry mat was closed even though the sign on the window said it closed at 630pm on christmas eve and the current time was just befor 5pm
so glad the option exists to have it repaired rather than replaced
at first it was good but over a few months service degraded
shouldve went with my gut and gone to apple
the person in the office was not much of a help either
spacious aisles for you to shop and push your shopping cart around
this time i thought i would try a local jeweler instead and was amazed at the difference
i can understand why people go out of their way to come here
however one screen door didnt have a wide enough screen and this led to repeated problems of gaps between screen and frame
i walked in scraping and gouging out holes from the broken bottom heel of my stilettos  walked out with a fullstride with their quick  inexpensive repair
i declined that as the carpets where most likely going to be replaced anyway and the deal was struck
they were flexible friendly and the service tech dustin made me feel comfortable having a stranger in my home
we will definitely be using zerorez again in the future
they offer drinks and snacks for the kids as well
elizabeth at labl was great to work with and she made great suggestions to have the dress fit my body
i didnt have to wait at all
wonderful service  left my carpets looking great
the new girl and brooke are extremely friendly and helpful
instead this guy was walking me thru doing it myself
charlie came out and was ontime but went on about how the fire place manufacture was not in business any longer and it would be hard to find parts
my boyfriends mom was frustrated because english is her second language
howard air was called they kindly bumped up our previously scheduled maintenance visit and bryan our usual tech confirmed that our system was in need of expensive repairs confirmed by competing bids we received over the next two days by other hvac companies or replacement
definitely age appropriate
the biggest problem was that he decided to spray paint the door after it was already hung
i will be back for sure
ive had carpets serviced before and this is the worst
it was a nice design pleasingly affordable wellmaintained danishstyle wood table with an extension leaf and six matching chairs
thank goodness i had on boots and not sandals
if you want cheap go to walmart
he came  gave me a quote right away and was at the house the same week
i called down to the main office and they tell me he had no gate code
they take the pain out of getting your book to market
thank you so much for your assistance
thats odd i said because just 2 days earlier i reconfirmed this with rob
i thought waiting until black friday might save me 10 so i waited on the mattress for a week while looking for another box spring
they did a great job my carpets were so dirty and they were very nice and professional
dukes was much more professional fixed the correct problem and even gave better pricing for the blower motor which wasnt even broken
then i gave him the paper and my file yesterday and the cards were ready to pick up this afternoon
the gentleman who took care of my shoes was super nice as well
the school does not have very good organization and they dont communicate well with parents i was never told what my child did  during the day or if he even napped
great honest people there very happy
you can make mistakes and your substitute carrier makes them in spades
kind of overpriced for a thrift store especially for stuff in bad quality they want to charge you like 10 dollars for something thats maybe worth 2
i had to report them to the better business bureau
let me tell you if you are going to quote at a certain price you better stay around that damn price
the only negative i can say is that because of friendly movers excellent job i expect the same from all movers
they even called us once just a few hours later to say that they wanted to be honest and that they couldnt get to my order that day i was so happy to hear from them but told them i was fine with the 4 day quote time
highly recommend mike to help get things moved
ray came promptly to replace my motherboard on my 60 sharp
i signed up about 2 months ago and have very little to complain about
it is brand new and  clean
great service and affordable prices
took my playstation 3 here after it stopped reading discs
oh and by the way come up with a way that this one thing could also be done electronically
they did do a good job but for 4 items my total was   1872
this is also the only dry cleaner ive been to where they ask you to pay up front  i know that seems weird but every other place in steele creek south park university area and ballantyne ive been to asks for payment after theyve delivered your clothes to you
pay when you pick up
im telling all my friends to go here if they need to because smart fix turned my bad day around and they did an awesome job for a fraction of the cost
visit 1 they scheduled to come by between 12 and 4 which was quite a window of time considering it was my only day off and had a million other things to do
they just all have an attitude listening to their music on cell phone and texting
highly recommend them
it is nice to have a notary just down the street who will take her time with you
i am looking for another place
highly recommend allied print  design
no stress no pressure no contract to sign
showroom available by appointment only i read that as high end sales only
she was still arguing with me as i left
best to find another copy and print store or better yet buy your own copier fax printer
i immediately called back and when i got brad on the phone he informed me he assumed i hung up on him so he deleted all of my information from their records for my cleaning
yes the place has free wifi and the machines are clean and reasonable sized
professional and likable
he obviously has an incredible understanding for how clothing sits on the body
its quite frustrating when you find the perfect dryer not to know if the matching washer was here
all of the stains were gone
i opted to have him replace the light with a new led one
the classes are great as well
top quality service
the owner was very helpful with all my questions
if there is something you can do he will suggest it to you and sometimes give you a discount or freebie to help you out
i looked at the reviews and since yelp gives it 5 starts thats why i called
friday evening i got a call to confirm the saturday appointment again
quick and easy
they repair phones tablets and computers quickly here
i would like to thank mr maurice for his continued help and patience over the years on making and keeping my dearly beloved man looking like he just stepped out of gq magazine

chad who i booked the move with was honest and informative on the phone
after two months that my 13 year old misplaced her iphone
i got so many compliments at the wedding
if you do the wash and fold its 125 per pound and they ironed my dress shirts and put them on hangers
i came confused as to  how this so called company is till in business
trust me my children have been at this school for yearsnot weeks
eventually he was becoming very rude when i would call him to get an update needless to say i went to the store at least 3 times  he couldnt help me
he then preceded to tell me that the soles on jordans dont hold very well after regluing
as you could imagine i said pardon me
for someone that is new to using printer services the staff was not very helpful
i must say  i do believe jesus loves a tailgate party
been here 5 times no issue
its not just that but there is free play arcade games for one price of venue which is awesome
steve just educated us on how to do our de filter properly
i return on saturday to find an ugly added flower on my sleeve with a snap button that immediately unsnapped when i put the dress on
the bronze sculptures give us a glimpse of its past industrial era
the woman is rude and hot headed
i called customer service to ask if they knew what time the truck would be arriving today
they only had two people working the counter which caused a line almost out the door
very friendly and professional group of people but yet very serious about what they do
straight to garbage
you may find it helpful to more micro manage the process
they made an appointment to come out the following morning
finally they charged me for cleaning the salt cell which my old pool service included as part of regular maintenance  clearly next season i will look for someone else
best service and very fast
so i hired them for my shift from miami to seattle
plus the price was the best in the area
jim and his folks are total professionalsknowledgeable technically skilled detail oriented on time and flexible if needed
at the end of it 3 college kids were left completely broke inwardly and outwardly and new planet could care less
she even called to confirm the appointment
in short it was too much of a hassle
instead of trying to get me to spend 50 to 100 he settled for no charge
the problem i had was that my phone was literally pitched black and the screen didnt have any touch response
the shop is usually busy with weekdays after work being less busy than saturdays
30 mins before arriving received a call from the company asking if i lived in an apartment i once again told them yes then she asked what floor i was on and responded with the 4th
this place did an awesome job
now it doesnt work at all it was fine prior to signing it over to them
if i were a thief this would be my modus of operandi
the feet of the furniture were clearly standing in water
i love this place
the clockmaker or the timekeeper as id like to call him was unapologetically silent but still friendly
they came out right away
the maids arrived on time and were really nice and friendly and got to work as soon as they stepped in
pretty sure she gets kickbacks but hey  whatever
if you have a lot to do suggest you drop them off and pick them up later
they said i had a balance remaining
absolutely atrocious customer service
i called and was told on  a saturday mind that if i brought it in that day i could have it back by 5 pm on that monday
i was able to contact a 2nd tier rep today
please please please consumer beware
totally worth it
plus when you call them out on their bs they freakout and hangup
only lines moving were the self checkout lines
what a terrible service and billing
i higlhy recommend it
i found two vendors online that offered giclee printing
she has done so great after the prek that we did not hesitate to enroll our new baby
so i rode back to the store where my two missing items were behind the counter waiting for me
i would recommend them to anyone
dont stand there laughing and not being helpful at all long story short
carl is a totally great guy and business operator
having said that the staff here were very helpful in recommending other places to search and were also quite friendly
outstanding work once again
even the chef rodrigo came out to make sure me and my bf liked our meal rustic pizza was da bomb and the antipasto salad was as big as beyonces booty but tasted waaaayyyyy better
team acme is as good as it gets
50 is not going to keep me from eating but my experience with this company owned by jesse amoroso has been one of deceit extreme incompetence unprofessionalism and rudeness
these guys especially jeremy were great
i bought my dress from luv bridal and they had janet as a recommendation for alterations

from speaking to conrad the owner to nova their scheduler and admin extraordinaire
i scheduled a drop off time for the next morning and they had it done in less than an hour after i dropped off my iphone

as for joe i would have been better off talking to the branches they charged me 375 to haul away that took all of 15 minutes
i tried to call the customer service twice to explain the late payment which i believe was caused by a fault in their online system
a great service and results
everything was so professionally done
maria finally called me back at 330 to tell me the technician was 30m away and would need at least 40m to repair the door

if i dont live so far away i would come here on a weekly basis
whats the deal with that
finally if they are geniuses and they can answer all questions about apple software can someone teach them customer service
i called ahead to ask what a typical repair price was and they said that it would be 2999 for a diagnosis and then they would call to let me know what the balance would be if i decided to go ahead with the service
check out groupon for a coupon for four five different wines and two appetizers well worth the price of course you can upgrade
i like that feature and ive used it before

what it isnt full of is customer service

he is honest and even made friends with one of my cats
dont eat here
if you need your knives before the weekend make sure to bring them in ahead of time maybe midweek because everyone clearly has the same idea to get them sharpened at the last minute on friday morning

i am sure they have the proper equipment and materials to do the job in a timely manner with superior results
note cashcheck only no credit cards  half deposit required at drop off

i have been trying to resolve the issue for over a month now and they keep saying theyre going to check on the shelves and refund me never have
returned it by noon i was emailed my payment confirmation and i was on with my day
the 12 admission fee is very reasonable but because i have 2 young kids who need snack breaks and naps a few hours is all we can handle thus the yearly membership is a great deal
anyways seeing the previous review and that there is only one review of them i realize i shouldnt have pick a service without reading yelp
the place is nice and clean
great personalities also
the grout between my tiles was really dirty and they had a 3 step process to clean it
people already know and they respect you more if you are honest
the growth i have seen from beginning of the year to the end has been amazing

but i really like to take care of the ones i do have
its drive through everyone is really nice and they have always done excellent repairs and alterations
i went to suspend my service because i had gone through a difficult time
if you find the place you wont be disappointed
i should have read the other reviews before i wasted my time

and i sharpen all my own knives
joe took care of right away called  me on sun

these guys showed up on time according to the no obligation estimate appointment
when i explained i worked night shift they squeezed me in earlier during the very next day then they had an opening for to accommodate my sleep

they gave us a very reasonable price said it would take 2 days and sent us an email one day later to say the computers were fixed

i went to tonys with my boots asked how much and how long and the man said 12 dollars and 20 minutes
ive used hydrocare twice now an thy have been great

the selection here is outstanding

we cannot say enough about what a wonderful experience working with  zippy shell of las vegas was
these people are thieves
one could go in this store and consider doing something similar or totally different from what you already have
their method of taking credit card payment was also super sketchy on the sales clerks phone

they moved us in 7513 and i cant rave enough about them

we chose this company based on its 5 star yelp reviews but that was a big mistake
they have raised prices a lot before they sold things cheaper now everything sells very expensive i do not like that there are people who pile up on things and you can not look at them

they cant keep up with a high volume flow of business and instead of improving themselves to do better  they just deny you and turn you away
this was our first and last time at this place
the employees made the impossible  possible
but the best part of stuart is the way he lets you in and listens and has such enthusiasm for what he sees and hears on the basis of an experienced pedigree that includes the elite builders of this golden age of luthiery
the director is always here before the center opens ready to greet the parents and children with a welcoming smile
i dont think it very efficient though 2 huge portions of the pool were reserved by classes
no stains no odors
i was going back out of state the very next day so i was sad but ok with the fact that i would have to leave my ring to be fixed
however they werent able to immediately come out
he took them completely apart and replaced the internal parts
amazing owners and staff
the main reason for the lowness of the rating is that they did not show up when scheduled
also they have international stamps unlike other places
i went to see them at experimac because i could trade in my imac for a better model and pay very little out of pocket
they were reasonable in their price so i gave them a bonus

im not sure how he did it but my macbook pro is no longer typing m comma m comma m comma when i hit the spacebar
i came in today to get my iphone5 repaired
they have also worked on what we honestly thought would be impossible to clean
it was ok i dont know how can there be an outstanding passport photo experience  anyway what is very nice about this place is that it is actually very well priced based on the few shops i have tried in toronto
they also have a lady in on tuesdays and thursdays who does alterations and those prices seemed quite reasonable as well
maybe it is her kind and caring personality knowledge about the body and recognizing that what works for some may not work for others or the fact that whenever i train with her she is always teaching me something new and seriously kicks my butt in a good strong way
but the space was so clean and service so professional that i made this my go to when i moved to charlotte to live with my boyfriend

i would not recommend a place that is willing to accept a bad reviewi let the employee know i was writing a review he didnt care since he was off when i called in lose 1 customer over 12 and maybe more after this bad review
roman was awesome
then i asked why they didnt call to schedule the appointment on thursday the office manager told me that it was her fault and that she didnt have time
but the lunch price of 12 dollars goes along way toward promoting your business and makes you really feel like you youre really welcome and belong to the vegas community of locals

there were plenty of machines to choose from where you didnt have to wait for someone ahead of you
the man in charge of this guinea pig factory is useless and rude

after visiting the magic tailor i was very pleased with the level of service i had received from the staff and was extremely impressed with the quality of work done on my coats

you will be totally satisfied with their work
i am so happy with almighty air
yes you get your clothes dry cleaned onsite but the staff is rude
i have four doors from this company

so i thought i would give it a try
i can tell this job is hard because they have to deal with different kinds of problem everyday
well never use another carpet cleaning company again
now that i have done business with 3 monkeys i couldnt possibly go anywhere else for my needs
they always provide quality work at very reasonable prices
i mean how hard would it have been for him to call kirby and order the part from them instead of i cant even believe im writing this super gluing the broken parts

but its a corporate shop and sometimes you get a lil piece of corporate attitude along with your purchase
i was going to my first ever pittsburgh steeler game and i needed to look good
i had an emergency situation with a rug that my foster dog used as a toilet and they managed to squeeze me in the next morning
they do well with the complicated stuff and the simple hemming and shortening of sleeves are priced pretty cheap too

i would definitely recommend him and will have his number on hand for future repairs
they were professional and i would highly reccommend these guys
side note they have all kinds of flooring
i went to show them the problem
a reputable dry cleaner would pay to replace it but no he only insulted me by saying i bought it in like that and said it was too tight on me and i spilled food on it
my pants are too tight what to do  i think they shrunk bella figura this is the tailor for me
my floors had never looked so clean
they do great work and are very accommodating

aaron the shop owner is great
i try to find a good palce to fix it but i got bad experience here
anyways i didnt find anything that really wowed me as i browsed through the many racks a pretty big goodwill

my worst expieriences with customer service
the drivethru service is such a plus and just so convenient
was a previous customer of delias but decided to go to a small locally owned business

also used their one to one training for final cut pro
i came back in later that week and when i brought it in he said its a manufacture problem because they didnt sew them on tightly enough i told him that i specifically asked him not to wash the dress if he couldnt insure that it wouldnt get ruined

a  thanks justin
keep up the good work
seconed visit came in for a fill and noelle did so

she asked me what i wanted and then she delivered on time and the dress looks as if i bought it to fit like it does now

first let me say that ive been using bulwark for several years
not ready yet after 40 min waiting i decided to go home and come the next day

this was my first time using bulwark and it was a great experience
i had already been to the apple store frys and contacted two other technicians regarding my coffee keyboard catastrophe and everyone quoted me a ridiculous fee and a huge turnaround time

i am 5 so i need a lot of alterations
the mechanics finished the upgrades in less time than estimated and rama called me as soon as it was done
they didnt try to oversell me which i greatly appreciated
it must be something with our systems im sorry
it would take another week
prices and flexibility of schedule is great
the first thing the tech said i think he said his name was matt was our tile was sealed so anything they do wont make a big difference
what i spent in altering was a fraction of what i would have spent in a new wardrobe
i went in there around 1pm on 111314

this fedex store has what i would term the large franchise feel
if i have the same problem again with my laptop i can fix it myself
i have found my forever dry cleaner and highly recommend trying them out
its also a great one for people who cant commit to a regular ongoing schedule as this is a place that doesnt need experience but people are more than happy to teach you how to garden and tend to plants
would be a zero star but it wouldnt let me
i had to go up to her and she was playing some game on one of the samsung tablets in order to check me in
i was impressed with the inside of the shop  by far the cleanest most organized dry cleaner shop i have ever been in
the facility is well maintained clean and easy to load and unload
and also the manager who is also short and white
