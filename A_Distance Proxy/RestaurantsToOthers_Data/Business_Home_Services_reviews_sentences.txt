and now after living in vantage in henderson i really really miss turnberry towers because it is true luxury living
but this room only cost 80
we were flabbergasted and asked what it was which turned out to be a black mark inside of the dryer
so happy that i found this place
grand appliance reminded me that shopping local is such a good idea
monday rolls around
it took almost 3 months
my proof is in the pudding
she scheduled me for an appt explained their full process which was just like the larger franchise companies and i was taken care ofright then and there
showed me what was wrong with my old one and showed what the recommended part looks like
the only thing im not sure they do is laundry
i was a bit messy in college so i dont really know if it was entirely their fault
itll save a little money anywayalthough i dont know that i would have predicted utilizing the top down in the windows i do
they showed up two hours late then loaded our stuff in their truck without using the moving blankets they had and i requested they use
we are extremely happy we went with presidential pools
i have been in the house im in now for four years the only reason im looking to move is because it has been robbed twice
3 they are shady
i love the underdog so why was i so willing to trash them well that was simply me not thinking about my actions before i hit send
they knocked it askew and didnt put it back so when i went to hop in the shower after they left water spewed everywhere
be very afraid
the dispatcher told me the driver would be there in 2030min i was happy to hear that since i could still get to work as being tardy if im 2 hours late and not absent if im more than 2 hours late
when he came out he was very professional an listened to exactly what i needed
a pleasure to work with
i would go back should i need another piece
i had a wall unit built 7 years ago
i always get the full package but they have not ariated my lawn in about three  years
do not have the same service in the bedroom that i have in the living room can only watch tv nothing else
i cancelled their prism tv bundle yet they continued to bill for 2 more months
with higher fees then first told in email my family walked out
valet service was outstanding
it was a tough job in 90 degree heat but the locksmith never remained friendly and positive
i can get a brand new phone for 50 more than what they quoted me
do i try to find security
i think the management team is outside of the pittsburgh area in another state
they still could be heard
i highly highly recommend ted and his team to anyone moving short or long distance
also he told her there would be no charge for this first house call and promised that mountain park plumbing would be happy to solve any future plumbing problem anytime just give him a call
we had a complicated service situation since we were dealing with a home warranty company and a house we just moved into this april that was built in 1993 at first i thought to call another hvac company that we used at another home to just get an inspection and do any necessary preventative maintenance
they are on 247 due to my sensor not working properly
all my tvs are in sync and finally a happy girl
cleaned up the area when done and couldnt have been nicer
frank was the technician that finally completed the work for us and he was a great guy  he understood the problems and worked with me to get my units taken care of i would recommend frank for any business customer he knows what he is doing and he gets the job done competently and quickly
while he is in business i will call no other garage door company
stay away from this place it takes weeks or even months to get poorly made furniture delivered
uh yeah were in the desert
first of all the price cant be matched
came out quickly
the irony of original sheperd fairey prints hanging in a place that enforces a dress code did not escape us
my closest pool store didnt have what i needed
he said hed get back to me at the end of the day with the details
i highly recommend over the big guys
each day the crew swept the floors put their tools and materials away and left the house they way they found it except for the paper on the floors and counter tops
i called them back the following day and nobody responded and the next two days and sent emails and texts which was a weekend but they claim they are 247
this is a great company to work with and i am passing eds name on to friends in the phoenix area who need new doors installed
i was especially impressed that they provided free guided tours to view work in progress
i paid by check and included a tip
rep that came to house walt was very professional and courteous
anyway there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy
i will definitely recommend them to anyone who needs help with cleaning
while our problem was small in terms of plumbing they came through just like they said they would
the crew dug the gravel out from around the exterior of the home removed the loose material from the stem wall painted a plastic type barrier onto the wall and finished the wall with a rubber coating before painting
straight bs these guys cant find good service if good service smacked them dead center in theyre face
zona was onsite almost immediately even on a holiday
who ever the guy is that picks up the phone sucks at his job and he works at a phone store so idk i give 0 stars
he gave me his card with his personal cell to contact him if there were any further issues
where can i start
not to mention how rude they were when i tried to call management in dealing with this issue
you have been warned
either i provide a solution or they provide a solution
the sierra ac customer service rep that scheduled my service got me an appointment for the next day and she was very professional and helpful in explaining my pricing options
id definitely stay here again
i recently moved out of state and needed to rent out my condo
my first service maintenance experience was great
2 need quality cleaning done  3 timely  4 expertise 5 friendliness 6 dont want to deal with hidden costs and a business that actually cares about your needs
very honest and helpful and they support our military
but if you have mlife card it becomes a whole lot more affordable
on site storage units are a huge plus for us while we continue to evaluate and reevaluate the stuff we can and cant live without
i called jason on a friday afternoon to replace a paleolithic liftmaster unit that had finally hit endoflife
love it here
he was the only one that did not charge for estimates and consultation to me that said a lot
just a great realtor very personable and relaxed when showing us houses
lets go moving company did a great job in helping us move to our new place
literally just needed to be jiggled loose and everything was good
even with the cons i would highly recommend staying here plus you get to use mgms wet republic for free as well
even when we called the receptionist was trying to say we cracked it
michael has been doing this for many years and you can tell by his expertise and the way he handles himself and the problems that may arise
jeff from jh plumbing is great
be sure to read reviews as they make all the difference in the world
im highly disappointed with this complex
mark taylor is no longer the managers of the complex
can we start by stating how much steve is a lifesaver
yelp is for the opinion of the consumer
bryce and stefanie are true professionals
its not just the appliances either its also the bathroom rod that kept coming off the wall the toilet in the second bathroom that wouldnt flush and the track lights that you have to pay 7 for each bulb to have replaced if one goes out the bulbs are super cheap in 10 months we had replaced 3 of them and i just stopped calling the officewe have 2 more out and we are just living with it
i was not aware and the check bounced
often times i had to bother management and maintenance to get something done even after i put in a documented work order at the leasing office
they did a fantastic job
what great customer service
they made it clear that theyre not handymen and wont give me a handyman price
oh but next time we will definitely be fined were out  stay awayharbor island sucks
with the price this place charges for rent you could do a lot better
if you dont let hot tubing with homeless people this is not the place for you
not thinking anything of it i said yes
the following 5 had 2 no shows and 1 good clean
first time is when i first moved to the state of arizona
he was out of ac and couldnt figure out the problem
not only will they take the time to walk me to the aisle where the drywall anchors are but they will also ask me about my project if i had any questions and if i needed help with anything else
when i requested a quote from 6 vendors on friday evening troy was the 1st to respond
that is when i found clonemykeycom and i am so glad i did
also their dispatchers were courteous in keeping me informed of scheduling including a reschedule needed due to unseasonable cold weather
thank you travis owner now i have a dependable garage door service for life
our conference center looks beautiful inside and out and i couldnt be happier
der klopper war das frhlingsbier
removing existing carpet flooring would be extra
highly recommended and will only go to jerry for plumbing repairs
this company id call me on time and had me scheduled right away the technician even gave me a courtesy call to ensure i was home
i liked being off the strip
i spent over an hour walking through various sections looking for someone to help and inform me about a product but i ended up witnessing groups of 2 or more associates quickly walk away from me as i approached them on 3 separate occasions during this one hour period
they are reliable and efficient
and to top it off the guy cleaning the carpet was dripping sweat all over the place from carrying his equipment and dragging the hoses everywhere
we had considered all the work the house needed and was looking for a solution
i will definitely recommend lv pro tint to my friends
very polite and patient
i bet if you had to live cook and sleep in 90 degree temperatures you would not be saying we understand your frustration  you would be actively doing something anything to provide some alternative for us
chris the newest employee indicated the company employees have a saying make and install the ironworks as if it is being placed on our own home
don from pure plumbing recommended we call quick response to clean up the water and rip out sheet rock etc
i had gained 6 quotes from companies with good online reviews
for soon a glorious prophecy shall be fulfilled and all our pains will be gone
he seems to like responding through text for appointments
thanks for telling me what i told your dispatcher
the first day in i had electrical problems and all the lights went out i had to stay at my friends house for a day and a half until they fixed everything
i know that you could buy that system a lot cheaper online and install it myself jake will respond with its cheaper online because of a warranty of 30 days and not a year
mari is a terrible manager  business owner
the staff are helpful in answering questions and the amenities are always a plusthe apartments themselves are amazing especially the kitchen and bathrooms
if you know of a provider in sw charlotte that actually works let me know
we felt comfortable knowing that we were dealing with someone that was very experienced and knowledgeable
we brought the information back and said we are just shopping and we just did windows and this was next
we had both our front and back yards done
he didnt charge for his ideas of for all the trips to the show rooms that he had to take either with me or by himself
the most condescending pompous business owner ive met yet in vegas
no time to bring boxes in the househad to dump them all in the garage
alan s plumbing was professional and timely and went out job their way to help me with home warranty
we didnt hear a peep
i did my research and shopped around with three other landscapers and he gave me the most reasonable pricing
brandon and his boys took great care of us and kept in constant communication leading up to the moves and on moving day
several days later i received a thank you note from the company along with gift cards towards my next service call
i had an issue with my gas furnace and my home warranty company contracted 5 star home services to come out
i have been in the industry for several years and after talking with angel i was convinced that the work would be done correctly
my neighbors are great as well
in addition whoever installed the old softener had made a mess of our valves
the guy could not be any more nicer or helpful on the phone
not only did i get excellent locksmithing if thats a thing he also fixed my door thats been misaligned for the past few years
he definitely does not live up to customer service communication and honesty
when a resident presents a problem and brings it to your attention take action and follow up with resident before they have to call you back
this man went to lowes and picked out the perfect one and chandelier light bulbs
management is great  very friendly and very helpful
free coffee is only provided during work hours and there is no creamer to use things break constantly
called for service and was told my warranty was still valid and there would only be an 85 service fee
they seem to have the best prices of any local hardware stores and pretty solid warranties on larger products
wow is all i can say great guy and great company
my new place is a typical corporate complex where they care very little
as i walked up to the door to lead him inside and show the garage he asked did your husband talk with you about the price
some of the baked goods were a bit overpriced for what it was
two men and a truck peoria did a great job for us
i appreciated that he could tell from feel what was happening in each of those 2 spots
the palm trees look great and i really appreciated the quick response and fast service
very professional and took care of my needs quickly and competently
tim and christian gave me a call when they were on their way
waited 15 minutes
what i appreciated about rolando was that he was professional and he didnt try to pressure me into making a purchase
7 gym is very small
i have used thor industries for all renovations and repairs for 8 years both professionally and for my own home
it was their fault that we hadnt been able to see it and that we wouldnt be able to go to the office to apply first
has a great book of all of his certifications and pictures of his work
he was very friendly courteous and informative
weve had penny electric out to our house twice this year for different projects and both times the service exceeded our expectations
he even put a popular phone on hold for him since it was the last one at this location and we would have to come back another day to finish the transaction
updating it to a two stars
my lease wasnt up for another month and though i had already moved most of my belongings out i still had a few items in the apartment
i thought replacing furniture that was delivered damaged is something that should be rectified by boho furniture maybe not
we did have to wait for an initial evaluation compared to other companies and we also had to wait a few weeks for the results of our engineered analysis
and the rep told me sometimes it can take 5 days
service sucks and customer service is the worse
i normally dont write negative reviewshowever this company deserves to be acknowledged for in my opinion being dishonest
so i used a bag to pick it up and throw it into the trash
they are very professional from the first phone call  paying attention to every detail
telling her that she may have problems down the road if she doesnt replace the springs  to get the bill higher  i wouldnt use this company again
at that time we also learned they will reassess the home value and may charge an adjustment fee if they assess the house to be valued lower
they showed up  740pm
russ did our inspection and said everything was great and the only one thing was if he was going to be picky he would charge us for the master bathroom showerhead but he was not going to charge us because the rest of the house was in such good condition and it had been 3 years  the problem with the master bathroom showerhead was that we upgraded it and didnt replace the old plain one that came with the house
when mentioned that the lights dont work you get the runaround and maintenance people who never show up
come for the groupon leave filing a police report
oh and at no time were the salespeople mean or rude they were quite nice  but for me personally i dont want to be followed while i shop
the lack of professionalism with their personnel in this office is distressing that their corporate office in california should be cleaning house with the people running this location
if it wasnt for a 301 filing fee i would have
you know you have a good detailing guy when they clean inside the wheel wells blow excess water off and use brushes on inside vents
the thief had the time to put two cinder blocks under my car and take off two tires and take them out of the complex without one person or security seeing this
we were a little picky about the paint colors and she had no problem taking us from one building to another to show us the actual color in various demo units
and whenever i come here everyone is so friendly with with huge smiles
btw the manager that ignored me and helped the other customer before me and got there after was named johnny
he got the job done fast and now my unit works great
just had my carpets cleaned and repaired
as well as a removal of tint too dark on my vehicle
we had made cash deposits that arent able to be tracked
you can actually hear the stomping of footsteps and wooden boards creaking and popping as the neighbors upstairs walk around
absolutely the worst place
no message was left or incoming call placed to me
they helped me the same day  fixed my ac unit in less then an hour
so is that business trick century link follow offer junk and bill double and expect customers to pay
thank you
i had already removed all the carpet and the tac strips because they where dry rotten and crumbled in you hand this quickly became a big issue for them
if i could give 0 stars i would
super friendly and quality materials
ive been using brewers ben franklin for plumbing for about 10 years
they were only company offering 100 insurance on things they moved not 60 per pound
carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants
this is by far the most professional irrigation company in the valley
he explained to me the storage facilities are run by pods whereas the transport company is a third party
i talked to chris on the phone and he told me the ac was 38 years old
the customer service was spot on
he is the perfect person to do your taxes and ensuring that you get the proper refund that you deserve
to everyone writing about the twomonth lease break penalty  this is normal and written into the contract that you ought to read before signing
amazing place to live
it never fails
the ac worked great
i was in need for an ac repair
avoid this place its all a front
after a month a couple of the lights stopped working so i called them out for yet another repair and after one changed bulb one light still did not work and was charged another 75
2 bathrooms less than 50 sq ft total promised one day job
they can also order anything from a huge selection of catalogs
they just packed up their stuff and left
it would have been 4 stars had it not been for so many things being out of stock
when they say asap they mean it
william was very nice and courteuos and advise he would call when he was 30 minutes out
that was a minor detail they followed that i greatly appreciated
my wife and i were very happy with the quote and booked him on the spot
the residents in this place are also very inconsiderate
this is a shame considering the cleanliness of the community areas
and that first month rent fee excessive when compared to all other companies they charged to set up the lease just stayed in their pocket
no other form of id would be accepted
i had to seek out a sales person a newbie and bout over 10k from him in 15 minutes
if i have a question he is easy to reach and will get back to me in a timely manner if i wasnt able to get a hold of him the first time
i overheard as she was working with my roommate andyikes
they are like news now
fast friendly and a great price
cracks ruptures burn marks boltsparts missing squeaky sounds check for everything and record it on your phone
from the time i spoke to the lady who answered the phone she was very understanding my issues
when ever i visit the office i feel like im interupting them even though i try my best to address exactly what i need in a polite manner
we had used diamondback plumbing before
this review is long overdue
i had concerns that my older ac might have problems this summer and yes they do charge to come out and diagnose
in 2015 the original developer was transitioned out creating a board of directors consisting entirely of volunteer homeowners that actually live in the community
they never emailed me back so i called in again after a week
finally redid the carpet myself
i have been using iclean for over a year now
i only wish there were a way to give a better review
do your walk through upon moving out
the price couldnt be beat and we will not hesitate to use this company again in the future for all of our carpet and flooring needs
what i would give for a night with the st clair twins
my technician enrique ortega  was so kind and considerate to my home and my needs
after the time we spent at the front desk they finally gave us our room
our designer dj was the first issue
his personal concern and is professional manner or something you rarely find anymore
id like to know what his vices are as he seems perfect
i would strongly recommend aqua caliente
they try to get me to do parts of their jobs for them theyre the next review in line
yes the puc decision put a huge loss and management decisions to be made
he knew what he was talking about clearly explained the science behind the brewing process shared his insights based on years of experience and took the intimidation out of starting to brew at home
it takes a week for service repairs even an ac repair when its 110 degrees out
whoever build my housedid the wiring did a half assed job that rivaled dmv customer service
he showed up ahead of time on the date of the move
so far i am not pleased with this company
my wife called them up in the morning and a gentleman name luiz came out within an hour for an estimate
there are places worst areas with much better living conditions
im such to death of lying sales people
ferris was very knowledgeable about the new ac units and took the time to demonstrate the control panel functions
i didnt feel pressure to select one over the other and appreciated his suggestions and expertise
never ever give them your ss number
needless to say i wont be returning
he asked me what do i want to do with my backyard and he did exactly if not more than what i wanted
they took care in the move
i dont bank here fortunately but am forced in once a month as my landlord has his account here
we tasted 5 different wines and every guest found at least one they loved or 4 in my case
cash in hand i left crisis averted
jason the rep i dealt with to set up the move over the phone and by email was really professional friendly and helpful with answering all my questions
best company to use
it was much appreciated
after that the leaks were back to how they were previously
good price too
came home to no fence and couldnt get in touch with anyone
carmon made copies and was efficient and professional
i was in building 15 kevin and rick maintenance were always so helpful and fixed everything right away
leads me to believe ace is an honest company
luiz is always so friendly
before this company created this yelp
kayla in the local office was very friendly and professional when i called to schedule our move
very true about the amount of people that smoke pot in this place cant open my windows at night because the smell of weed gets into the apartment
dont you think you would put a sign on your mailbox informing clients not to put checks into it
is it imperative to have both heat and air conditioning in this valley
five stars to you man
i wanted this house pool and spa and i was running out of time
however i had a bad car charger that was only about a month old and michelle got a manager to replace it for me free of charge
relocating across the country is a difficult task even if you plan months ahead
it is a 1014 minute commute to campus
cut and pasting replies and not even taking the time to understand the problem
less than three hours later i drove away with a fresh new tint job
amazing customer service and a great guy all around
there were many differences in design quality such as az rainfall uses alumawood for their ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders
this outfit does it right from the presentation execution installation and followup
when my garage door was damaged i had paid two other contractors to come out and give me an estimate
dont even bother unless you need the area for convenience
no one called us from the office
the phone number is actually to jupiter support
the end results were really nice but as far as customer service it sucked
but instead i waisting over half of my day waiting on them and i didnt even receive a simple phone call or sorry
because the stuff they are using to spray for bugs isnt working on them
i felt ive been ignored and from this point on i will not be buying my carpets from carpet n more
she decided to cancel her order called within a 24 hr time frame and this am four days later we get a call from the office scheduler and she says my mother might be billed for the travel time
jim n peoria
for this last repair i called the day before and he came the next day in the 117 degree heat
by the way they somehow had in their notes the lady i spoke with at corporate that my complaint was about a storage issue not a rental issue
i should get it looked at now but like most people i wait for something to break before fixing it oh well heh
really appreciated rick and his patience
the bonus came a few days later when installing a 3 pole timer i called george  he walked me through the wiring
see you in a few months for the update
i guess that is the cost of education and these are my cliff notes
still moldy beneath it all
the issues arose afterward
it was my first time hiring professional movers for myself so i was new to the process
they did an fine job as well thank you rose
would definitely use this company again
meanwhile later in the week they called and they asked me what zip code i was moving to and i told him
they should correct what they screwed up and install the openerpoor customer service
i spoke with 2 different people and neither one cared to hear the square footage
i wrote vic and he was very nice
the two employees that i dealt with today were very friendly however neither are fit to operate the business in an efficient manner in her absence
my car fit perfectly
i couldnt be more pleased with the entire process
can you imagine living in an apartment with a hole that big
thank you erik geisler and your team
this guy is nothing short of amazing
ill tell youbecause i didnt want to deal with a professional coming in taking forever to tear everything up and then charge me an arm and a leg
a week later somebody came out i had to take time off of work because they wouldnt come out on weekends  and determined it needed a new part
i called jeremy and he was able to schedule us in before she moved in and he went through each and every room cleaning the vents and changing the air filters
i enjoyed this place at first but now i wouldnt even live here if it was free
my husband brought our dog in with him when he went to check out samples and the ladies in the front office were smitten
our first movein day was the worst nightmareand i should have know how this year was going to be after that first day experience
i will be posting this review on both landtecks yelp page as well as las vegas irrigation repairs yelp page since apparently they are the same company
every time i enter the branch i am greetly warmly and welcomed as a member
i demanded a refund and canceled the service
if the unit was inspected and cleaned properly to begin with we wouldnt be at this point
i then asked edwin to stay on the line and we could conference call the manufacturer he just hung up with
they plopped the couch haphazardly within the room cushions strewn about
by the way all these charges were done behind my back without a letter or anything telling me i was being charged
thousands of dollars of things stolen
friday night saturday night
worst experience since moving to pittsburgh besides the apartment
the company moved my items
on top of affordable tree service doing a great job they didnt bill us until the job was completed
bad customer service technicians not showing up and when they do they do not know what they are doing
what makes her stand above the rest is the reliability and communication which is unparalleled
i have never worked with a team that takes pride and ensures customer satisfaction to the fullest
living in this place with all the black mold has caused serious health issues for myself and my animals
let me start by saying what the signature is not  it is not a grandiose vegas hotel
just moved to the area and had problems with toilets in house
i would trust them with any restoration need i have
but locals i guess residents of champaign county can join
the kitchen  bathroom sinks were paintedwith wallllll paaaiinnnttt
it has been over 3 weeks since we have heard from reyes and we have left her several messages about the most recent needed repairs as things continue to break squeak and or crack in our brand new home
they insisted that the problem was all on my end
it really made me feel like you were working hard to get everything accomplished
they were very nice initially on the phone i made an appointment to get an estimate at my house for security window tinting
also stated its impossible to get a hold of anyone and that you have to leave a message on their website if there is an emergency
they do a great job
balcony views are either strip view or mountain view
i dont think i would go back again
boyd called me a little while later and made it happen
had the carpetsfurniture  tile donewhat a difference
sent a husband and wife team to my house to paint unreal the paint job is horrible and i am currently pursuing a lawsuit
i always find something i love at homegoods monroeville
i wasnt disappointed
after the work was completed our neighbor came over to see the results
never again will i let this guy work on my home
bad customer service and bad salesman
he built it and made sure it will last for years
the most notable value i found with them was their negotiating expertise
we have moved with uhaul multiple times before and have used this location once before with no problems
i gave him a wide berthneed the move done by friday or saturday morning
my ac is working again and i cannot recommend these guys enough highly enough
when we moved in a bunch of stuff was broken and needed fixing so the immediately sent a mantenance worker who said im a bit busy today so i cant fix everything ow  but just sign here and ill make sure that we get it taken care of
im going to get this story to the news see if they can help others not get stuck like i am
i enjoyed that they had oatmeal and various toppings that you could apply yourself
initially i thought it was because they have good business practiceswell that good impression quicklyturned into thirst ontheir part i dont know what kind of shady side deals they have going on with these properties but they must be getting paid somehow a free service yeah right they must split that credit check money they steal from you dont be fooled nothing in life is freehowever the black girl there was a saint and if youre looking for a good worker you should go steal her because this company its on its way outupdate so im backdo u know cc had the nerve to call me in the middle of my work day about my review really who does that this furthermore tells u about her and her so calledcompany was she serious how dare you try and impose on my right to freedom of speechshe is so very lucky i didnt curse her outi find it very hilarious you would have the professionalaudacity to even call and harass melose my number ccor i will be forced to slap u with a harassment suitftr there was actually somedecent things i said in my commenti didnt get any praise for that now did i
really appreciated the effort and awesome work
he was very knowledgable and honest about the recommended services
i am more than happy to recommend them to anyone
when we asked about the 250 pet deposit we paid when moving in we were told  that was a fee you paid it get over it
one of our new locks malfunctioned and we called stanley security again
i phoned brandon late into the evening and he informed me that he did not tamper with the water heater but because the heating company would have shut the gas off they must have forgotten to turn the pilot light back on
your perfectly good grill
how can they fix anything if they are never contacted
after a noshow at 9am i texted him at 915 and called him at 920 am  he responded to neither text nor phone call
for the big things plumbing air conditioners maintenance is there the same day
best of all i didnt have to leave my house
would definitely call him out again if i needed locksmith service
i would definitly hire them again
you get 1 pot and 1 fry pan 1 dish cloth and 1 dish towel
shannon and his crew do an unbelievable job cleaning our office each week
he was honest and fixed both issues
i specifically requested that a cox technician come and not a hired contractor as they could not figure out the issue that is happening
so we reschedule on saturday and keep apologizing for the inconvenience
a different process than i am used to as most things are done online but after settling in i now realize how much easier it made things
however i went in to this particular location to buy a new phone because i currently live in the area
very professional and the installation only took about 20 minutes
ive only lived here for two months in a one bedroom apartment i am a full time college student
and you could make reservations via yelp
i have complete confidence in the owner and the crews he has put together
im looking forward to having them back for more work
i paid for a product and a service and i have neither the product nor the service to show for it at this point
i will be taking all my computers and laptops to them as long as i live in vegas
they had three ladies come out at once so that the job was done very quickly which means less money out of my pocket yay
i will do business with them again
the lady who took my call was very nice and got me in for the next day
i was super impressed with her desire to help me and educate me
it should be optional
we came back today and ordered three fans
she states her vacuum just broke the day prior
the home warranty company has made us do more than 7 service calls on a broken ac system through the summer yes unheated home in winter uncooled home in summer thanks to home warranty company
just closed on a house and needed the locks re keyed
it is fully exposed to the az sun 365 days a year
the other staff besides them are completely useless
they come cheap but thats what you get  cheap service
we purchased a new clicker today and was told that no set up needed and its good to go
ill take my money somewhere else
after a very heated phone call they did it
time was already of the essence
its only a few years old at the most and its in a prime location right off of the cave creek exit on the 101  not only does this location have a  large fleet of trucks but it also has onsite storage
and scott always knows about new things going on in the area
ben made a horrific experience palatable and even took monetary steps to make things better
they said no
sean stopped by several times to check on things which we appreciated
i asked for the manager but she was busy and would return my call later
heres the thing im an old lady and i view things with skepticism
i highly recommend this company
on top of that it can be  quite annoying to have the customer in ones face telling a professional how to do this and how to do that
it is very quietthey install it in such a way to minimize the sound while the water filters into the tank
very curtious and knew exactly what they were doing
dont let them tell you no

we are so fortunate
we figured they just went to get food or something even though we had already seen them take a lunch break but it was fine

what a difference a couple of years makes in customer reviews
my video streaming in hulu and netflix are affected and i called customer service and they want to charge me 75 to send a technician to my home
since then ive made sure to make my payments on time and i recently was excited to learn they had a consolidation program
i will surely recommend keys please to friends and family
very honest with exceptional customer service
as i said above  the major difference that sets this store apart from others i have been to is the customer service seems better and there is always someone around to ask questions to or to help me find things because home improvementprojects are definitely out of my area of expertise
he was very professional and worked extremely hard to get my carpets spotless
4 our 3 toilets were left with a stain in the bowels
several times over the years this place has had what i needed
great color for the vegas summers huh
my office had been there about 3 years  during which time the management staff constantly changed there was no reason to learn the receptionists name as she would be gone in a flash
they offer a reasonable dry cleaning service as well
guess their customer service diminished over the years
he showed up in 30 minutes and cleaned our oversized living room and stairs in leas than an hour for 99
he came with river to do the install and they were efficient professional and nice
the same day they sent over bob their sales rep i told him everything i wanted and everything i didnt
horrible heating system
he has fled the state
great service great cabinets and great staff
this was a repair job at an older house so i was worried that the glass wouldnt match but after the repair it looks like the break in the window never occurred

the technician adrian was prompt courteous and very thorough
we just received a letter in the mail telling us to vacate at the end of our lease
i called them on a thursday evening after contacting our home warranty company after our air conditioning went out
the only thing that stops me from giving it the 5th star is the surprise 300 security fee they dont tell you about i signed up online and got what i thought was a deal they told me my balance would be 397 but when i check in at 430pm a few things went wrong 1 my room they held for me isnt ready
i have been in building trades interior design business since 1988 having just moved to az i went with courtyard because of a referral

i called dukes and left a message
how does this happen
have to say it
i mean cmon man
we had to call 3 times before getting in touch with someone to tell us the technician was running behind
the new manager is a sweetheart but her assistant is down right terrible rude condescending and never ceases to talk down to you even when its very simple questions it makes going into the office to even hand her rent a chore
air command rocks
ultimately they used their own thermostat and just gave it away
not only did i get horrible phone customer service from there competitor pods but candace was truly the deciding factor on why we went with pack rats instead
i was going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was just running late from another appointment
there is no doubt that i will call camelback for my next move
very professional easy to talk to really knows what hes doing
its like they want you to have to pay from them to make two trips with your things so they can make more money off you
the complex is tucked away behind an office complex and some trees so it isnt directly on the street

it was obvious this year when we were ready to install solar on our house we would get a quote from got sun energy
not happy with how management has been approaching issues on the property
he did research on the market and area and made a recommendation as far as an offer that he thought was appropriate it was accepted and came in at less then the house was appraised at by out lender sothats cool though we didnt really test how low we could go
seeing all the homes going well over market value i was sure i was going to be displeased with the what i got for price i paid

the nicest folks youll ever meet honest and hard working
rocky and dan were great to work with
it is a criminal organization

this company needs to step it up for customer service
that is personal customer care and super knowledgeable staff that knows the bbq industry
they were always attentive and returned our callsemails as quick as anyone could hope
i said monday or wednesday and he never called again
i didnt buy anything and im not sure i ever will
i dont know which is sadder the fact that the metal for the bicycle rack is completely contorted or the fact that the wood rail has the edges lifted off
their front office was on top of things
i will be coming back in the next few days to get some molding that is much cheaper and a better selection here than at home depot
i had to soak up the water and put a fan on the area so it wouldnt smell later on
when i showed him my estimate from emergency air he said the only things from the invoice that he did not do were capacitor replacement and the duct cleaning because it wasnt necessary

instead i was given a small sign in front of a space that says reserved parking
but the actual service that i received was by far the worst part of the experience
it is stunning and wonderful
i do not recommend maidpro henderson
he is extremely attentive and available when i need him in a pinch
from the internal staff duchese and andy to scheduling my quote to the gentleman that came to do the quote i think his name was nick
we researched all the major az solar players and decided on solar city because of their actual track record and business model
the flexibility customer service and good humor made for a smoothmove fair price and ontime performance ensured the majority of our stress disappeared
he is very patient and really listens to what his client needswants and can translate that into a successful sale
we all will be a can of sardine by then
we called patterson roofing after noticing a leak we had in the bedroom upstairs they seemed knowledgeable so we decided to go with them
unpleasant unprofessional abrupt argumentative condescending abrasive inept completely void of customer friendly communication skills and a quick way to ruin a good day all rolled into a package of barely restrained hostility and the inability to empathize
greg and his team are awesome
however in my situation it was not a problem
my lease is about up here and while i wanted to stay we are being forced out of our apartment
propane smoking woods seasonings  they got all your bbq needs

i also wanted to be careful to get the most bang for my buck and find a home that provided adequate value for the price

poor management or no common sense staff
security heard the dogs  so lets see what happens
she was welcoming and didnt once make me feel rushed into the decision
salesman was knowledgeable and helped pick our new phone and case
talks you through whats being done and explains why
which is minimal and highly recommended kudos to you guys and your staff
he was clean and respectful of our new home too
all 5 tvs in my new home look awesome
call alex and he will clean a carpet 100x better than those things
months of me calling to remind them to pay me and countless of empty promises that my money was on its way

value that means a lifetime warranty on decking
our unit used to have upgraded appliances

regardless a catastrophe beyond description
i explained to them what was going on gave them some background about some off grounding in my house

he did a great job and our carpet looks perfect
i have to disagree that the majority of residents are elderly
this review is strictly for the asinine timeshare presentation by westgate at the westgate hotel
jerry is no longer involved in any way
he did not realize that i am the owner of the business so his actions to cover his own self blew up in his face
thanks again guys

i looked on groupon to give them my groupon code and realized that it had long ago been accepted and closed on groupon as i had to enter it on the the cleaning solution web site to set up the initial appointment
dont get scammed by these thugs
the cleaning crew is very professional and wear uniforms while onsite
chris  yvette made my house cleaner than its ever been
i only just noticed it they were my cold weather clothes
absolute disregard for your tenants
i wish i had more to say about bbg but apparently they are doing so well they do not need new customers
i would have been able to talk to their mac technician directly but he wasnt in at the moment
very professional in the way they handled everything from the initial call to an appointment within a 2 hour time frame one of their appointments was not prepared for them
the rug was stained due to the wooden feet on the couch we had in the room

todd had great input in this area which is helpful since i am not a landscape lighting designer
hotel was okay
the price was more than reasonable considering all the work that went into turning my patio into a real showplace
it is now 11am and we ourselves had to call them to find out where they were
over half the priority list wasnt done in the 3hour period while the same list plus some had been done the first time we hired them
i have a home warranty and this is the company they instructed me to call
the price was fair and the service was great
i took the challenge and i cannot find anything remotely close

i just bought a home and my husband was at our new house while i was at work

it looks like they may have an issue of returning peoples calls back to provide estimates i guess they need to work on that aspect of their business
they really get my laminate floors clean too
here are some reasons 1 guys showed up late
3 hours no call
long story short i moved my family member out of this dump
no one from hoa or leasing contacted me to notify me that i would not have the service elevator and i would have to share the residential elevator
worse to even talk to one of their employees on two of those calls i was on hold for unreasonable amounts of time excess of one hour
even when totally alone not in a relationship romance has always been an important part of my life
we had cckroaches we are very clean people we sent a request to get sprayed

it is so disappointing to have to go through bidding process again  trying to find another window contractor scheduling bids etc
i repeat stay away
once he did this he announced he needed different drill bits and left
the loan is very basic and communication with them has been easy
the only person there was with someone so i waited
pricing was fair and work was done to my complete satisfaction
they said they would call back within 15 minutes
although i know that by posting this review i am inviting desert wind to lash out at me and make false accusations against me as they have done to all other former tenants who have been brave enough to call them out on social media i dont care
thanks to these guys
i thought the cost was more than reasonable for a same day repair including the house visit  diagnostic and part

they never called me to tell me whats going on
everything we wanted was completed by early tuesday morning
dan was awesome
i would recommend highly for all electrical needs
on a july night my ac stopped working
they send helpful reminder emails too
ask the guy behind the desk about what you want instead of spending an hour looking through the inventory
i found this company on yelp and after trying to get in touch with a few other companies tyler the owner was very quick and responsive and called back answered all my questions and was very friendly and helpful

i lived here for almost a year and wouldve stayed longer had i not decided to finally move in with my fiance  the area is swarming with great restaurants within walking distance and honestly this is one of the most decently priced places in the arcadia area

we took the paint home painted the spot on the wall and you cannot tell where the spot was
first of all thats just common sense
yes i will always use them and highly recommend them
these guys suck
i would never recommend a friend or even an enemy to these despicable people
class act all the way
who are these people
he gave me a load of bs that customer service on the phone is different than their store they have different systems and on and on
staff is always knowledgeable and eager to help
called bill got through right away and directly
so i call alchemist to share the info and ask for mngrowner syd said she and rick are the owners
2 the system installed was a newer model from dalton missing tension adjustment gears on each end
my carpets look good as new pet stains are gone my five year old carpet looks just like it did when we first built our house
they look fantastic and i can say i had a great experience with pioneer
too bad because the technician was a nice enough guy
brett was also able to give me the best price on a variable speed lennox 5 ton hvac system with 20 seer rating and a 4 ton 2stage trane system
i had to use another company justin time and they were ok but charged me way more for less time spent moving
they didnt even change the price and management said that it wasnt there problem it was the other management company
i guess there really is some good service left if you are willing to do your research and look for it
i really appreciated the fact that the guy who helped us called my husband to let him know how many minutes he was away
well i really wanted to continue on with my search so i signed up the call came from stew
my husband had just gone out of town on a business trip and i was home alone with the baby when it was 115 and out unit wasnt cooling our house
his team arrived monday and completed both front  backyard by wednesday
apparently his ankle was trapped under my dresser and instead of him calling for help he doesnt say anything and then speaks to me rudely
trust me use these guys if you want cold air and dont burn a hole in your wallet this summer
i doubt that i will continue the costly membership because i cant seem to a cleaner at a time that is easy for me without having to lose time from work
even though the person refused to do the work they still refused a refund
in addition i received an email today about charges being posted on our lease meanwhile they have chosen to deactivate our account further attempting to hinder us from retrieving proof of past work orders and problems
very nice people as well
needed a screen replacement for iphone 6 the price was modest and the service was timely and professional
i moved in 4 months ago  they still havent fixed most of this
they were straight forward with no gimmicks or hidden fees
they did an ok job on my lawn when i owned the house
we just needed a smoke detector relocated and air filter changed
he did not mind me observing him and explaining me on what occurred so hopefully i wont have an issue with in the near future
i could not give them a high enough recommendation
come take a tour today
not the brightest light bulbs in the pack making me visit with return trips to finish one small project but all in all i know what and where to find what i need
their product is amazing
zero customer service
i found it surprising that they just didnt seem to be prepared for a sat night with both restaurant week and a show at gammage
i would rate it 5 stars but theres an issue with people not picking up after their dogs
there are a ton of companys out there to choose from
the owner of the company elias came by a couple of days later to do a visual inspection and assure i was satisfied
they pressured me into getting the service that day and said they could get me a deal
they say that they are cheaper then cox
being part of dc ranch we also get access to the community centers which include a fitness center there is one at foothills too basketball and tennis courts swimming pools and dc ranch community events  definitely a lot to do if thats of interest to you
after interviewing several contractors we were so pleased to have picked this company
i am so glad i came back
one star reviews do not happen often for me but i see no other option in this case
when i confronted him he hid like a coward and still will refuse to pick up the phone
1700 should get me some instructions some design input and at least 10 minutes of aiming the drip system at the hole and setting the timer  oh and at least one jug of their moon juice
the quality is not what they used to be
i signed up for new service 2 weeks ago
my friend offered to go to the hardware store for the parts to finish the job that rc willey didnt
also learned why the maintenance guy was amused when i made an issue of not having a gate pass for my vehicle
will for sure use them in the future for all my lock needs
i had david refurbishpaint an old vintage dresser
i wanted to express my appreciation for the professonalism in nick stewart
you hear everything your upstairs neighbor does especially if they are obnoxiously loudobviously
i felt something wasnt right so i called aire serv
unlike most companies ive used he never tried to sell me on anything
they came in and removed everything i asked to be removed
my clients of the restaurant said to call mike cross and your cooling needs will be history
owner contacted me and apologized on behalf of his team and asked to give them another chance
parking advice if you plan on pre or post event drinks or food go somewhere that validates parking
they were so accommodating and patient with us as we tried to figure out how to put two stories worth of furniture into a beautiful one story home
she cares about the tenants and is respectful to any concerns we have had also the maintenance engineer chris is professional courteous and shows dedication to resolving whatever our issue has been in a expeditious manner
biweekly would have sufficed
its ok tony a man isnt measured by the results of his sports teams he is measured by the level of his work
easy enough to locate a neighbor that can help you out with your need  just look in the trees and look for the hanging kicks
went there right away and they fixed it in 35 minutes
we spent 3 months living in a hotel because of their mistakes
we had a kitchenette living space bed space and the bathroom was amazing
he saved me 1000 i was just going to buy a new washer or 200 service fee at a minimum
i ended up purchasing some moving gloves and mattress covers
the leasing manager that came on while i was living there kim would lose my work orders so id have to reemail them to her but that wasnt their fault
the place is bright open and airy and seems a bit futuristic
truly makes me not want to walk in this store again
it is family run and they are usually onsite with their crews
it was actually rather simple
one was recommended to me through a friend so i decided to call them
specifically my belongings were not loaded onto a truck and shipped directly to the delivery destination
they were very professional friendly and efficient
if i ever need to replace glass again i wont hesitate to call chandler glass again
we woke up to a disconnect today but the rep i spoke to said we had not been disconnected
very friendly guys and they   carefully wrapped everything to make sure items are protected
the company is very knowledgable about the unique water properties in and around phoenix
always available for me even in odd hours of the day
you obviously dont want my business im calling 2 men and a truck
will definitely have them come back next month
they working non stop
thanks emmetts fixit shop
year two summer rolls around
they do however sell fabric
thank you jayson wells ps
i began internet service with dish in anticipation of tenants coming in november 1 the equipment was delivered and service supposedly hooked up to the house
getting in and out of the hotel was rather odd but overall a good location for what we needed and the friendly staff made up for what was lacking otherwise
i could tell nothing was wiped down since there were water rings from cups
we interviewed four companies including family movers express
this ace hardware has the most helpful staff of any hardware store around
my boyfriend and i drove 7 hours to arizona for business the day before i discovered this place
he met with me late at night because of pressing deadlines and even called his former customers to have them allow me to look at their pools that he built as we were on deadlines
they apologized but didnt offer any explanation and said they would be there the next day to plant the grass
very pleased with our new pool
at approximately 7pm saturday night i left the owners reception came to my room and my remote was not working
sales staff provided professional service helping me select the type and colour for my vertical blinds
the incident we know of was at bank of america so we went there
signed the estimate
i told him that i had many meetings that day but that i would make it work
on top of all of that the staff is extremely nice and accommodating
ill make sure to tell the rest of the small pool companies yall price match no more and take business else where
so over the years it got really dirty
they also said i wouldnt get charged for that time
it makes me angry how insulting this is to peoples intelligence
the staff the staff here is 12 students and 12 management
i know its their job to sell to tourist but to lie to us was just a different low
this company is a gem
he was working on a job in n scottsdale
i did not even know there were so many kinds of mint i ended up with orange mint pineapple mint spearmint chocolate mint lime mint and lemon balm
i was pretty put off by that attitude and didnt think we shouldve been made to be the ones at fault
im so impressed with the professionalism punctuality and quality service we received from heavens best carpet cleaning
the amenities are just amazing the clubhouse is open 24 hours which we both love
over the last 3 years at la loma cove located at 7024 e 6th st scottsdale az 85251 amcor has 1 schedule a driveway resurfacing and then taped off the drives in front of peoples driveways  and the common access point without communicating it properly mail and signs posted near the mailbox would have been a decent start
ann was and is an excellent agent very informative and great negotiator
squeegee and me does an excellent job at cleaning windows and done in a very professional manner
i even sent an email to scott to the email address on their site when this all initially happened and never received a response
i did however receive a call from diane with cnj services hopefully this time its really a plumbing company not air conditioning to inform me that they are reserving a spot for me for tomorrow 0503 day 3 with no water between 14 pm
they quoted us on the phone and were honest and only charged what they quoted when they got there
turns out this was his nephew jesus who used to work for his uncle
we are all moved in and settled and i cant thank this company enough for their kindness and hospitality and charm
from the reviews i could have expected delays incompetence and apathy
expertly fixed a toilet that several prior plumbers had left unoperational
i highly recommend you give this business a call
the security door is great
the same projects would have taken me double or triple the same amount of time
this is the second time ive used gcs for carpet tile and grout
after moving out of the apartment i received a final statement in the mail
its spacious and bright
i was again written up for having a broom left on my patio for one half hour
even months after the fact this is a nightmare
we have attempted to call mark taylor company directly since nothing is being done for us down here and yet no one has called us back or attempted to contact us
ive been here for only a couple of months but moved from a one bedroom to a two bedroom after only three months
between staying in touch with the sellers and justin justin told me he could in fact pull off this miracle feat
when i talked to her again deb got on the phone
i was panicked
we are getting to your job as fast as possible melissa will call you tomorrow to give you an estimated start date
i recommend you call them before anyone else in las vegas
i highly recommend audio contractors for any home theater needs
george and his crew painted my interior exterior and did a outstanding job
the edges were finished off beautifully and the installers cleaned up after themselves
so i always come here to get water
the first caller tried to help me to no avail  he then informed me to go to walmart and pick up a new sim card
also i worked on government contracts for years and when a contractor does not meet terms of the contract whether they be timelines or problems with construction they give compensation
they ask for permission on everything and take the time to introduce themselves
most definitely a 5 star company
lack of online billing seems a tad antiquated and ironic considering they provide blazing fast internet
things like the inside of my microwave making my stainless steel shine wiping windows dusting and wiping cabinets til they were shiny
today my water softner company came out for the filter changes to my osmosis system and while checking my softner they found the wire to the power box had been disconnected makes me wonderyour review helps others learn about great local businesses
instead showed up with three wooden crates strapped to the back of a flatbed
we drove over half an hour to get here to drop them off and to pick them up
we had our springs break and the bearing ring pop out we also needed a new gasket for the bottom of the door
marta is great and leaves my house very clean and sparkling
i just hope you people reading this understand that i have never done a review on anything before

they disassembled and reassembled and loaded and unloaded 30 boxes 2 full furnished bedrooms and a kitchen and living room within an hour and a half
i highly recommend mi electric
one of the best experiences with having work done on our home
as the 3 people were loading in our stuff one thing after another came in broken
nice enough guy  just very ineffective
salesman at this store location f avoid these scumbag scam artists at all costs
leaving in your car is a little confusing too
frankly i appreciate honesty
this company is all about bate and switch
management is very friendly and responsive to our needs
just wood wasnt the cheapest but wasnt the most expensive
he did this another time after new appointment set up
a contract means squat if it directly violates the law
andy the project manager came to my house to walk through it with me describing what needed to be moved and removed from the cabinets
yesterday i get an email saying even though they have the chase online bill pay prof of payments which shows the cox stamp on the back of the check they need copies of fronts and backs of the check to resolve the problem
the interest rates were good and the cost was less than any brick and mortar lenders
home inspection prior to purchase done by this firm who said all was fine with our 2 units
when i was there they keep the place in top notch shape had a concierge service fax and mailing from the front office and served food and drinks at the pool which you could charge to your bill
theyve managed needed repairs handled hoa issues and found qualified tenants during the slow part of the year
bill and his men worked like a well oiled machine and were in and out in record time they even took the time to educate me on the new thermostat
i did sign it so im screwed but with all we talked about i assumed he was taking good notes
id called them the day before to let them know that i will be picking up my order tomorrow
the new staff is inept and frequently loses rent payments or misquotes amounts due
artistic refacing is the best
we booked our stay 5 months ago called twice to make sure we had 2 beds
speaking of my neighbors i can hear every move they make including when they go to the bathroom
so whenever you are considering a place or moving in 1 read the lease before signing 2 record everything email is good because you have written evidence 3 when you do your movein inspection have a witness but also record everything
i will make sure to tell everyone i know about the great service you guys provide
the asia plaza to me is a magical place for a few reasons
if i could give negative 10 stars i would
our home has never looked so beautiful
i saw a young man walking towards me and i asked if he was responding to the overhead page and he said no but what can i help you with
they were very patient on the phone and you can tell the young woman who answered the phone kept going back and forth to their shop to ask me clarifying questions so they made sure they had what i needed
and well groomed
we just finished putting in a pool and needed landscaping to complete our backyard
gilbert was once again a no show 2 days in a row 1226  1227 stating none of his guys showed up for work
the owner was kind attentive and knowledgeable about the product
i will definitely be going to real fast auto glass from now on
sad they cant do right by the tenants nor the property owners
i was sitting on the springs and embarrassed as heck when we had friends over
he showed on the same day i originally contacted him and he charged a reasonable rate for the services provided
although they were very speedy they were so careful not to hurt any furniture nor the doorways they had to pass through
i have found that all of the agents and i have had dealings with most if not all of them have been professional and very pleasant
i took a weeks worth of vacation to be there and they never showed
you wait longer here for fuel then any penske iv ever been too
boxes and furniture
the carpet was vacuumed and everything was clean
not only did phoenix carpet repair give me a free quote over the phone within hours they were at the house making my carpet look like new again
the work was satisfactory  matt and his electrician were professional  i will defintely use them again if i need electrical work done
and i clean up after him every single time
results realty advertised and promoted my condo and found a tenant in a very short period of time
he tried to call me and for whatever reason i didnt get the message
these guys have really fallen way down on my list
their computers were stocked updated and ran smoothly in every game we played
we thought that was outrageous since as most of us know what happens when the contractor has most of the money is his pocket servicecontrol degrades quickly
i was so happy with my experience that i am taking the test for lmo next month
so when i tried reaching back out about my refrigerator incident they blamed the other company and told me there was absolutely nothing they could do for me
they are very kind and easy to work with
we appreciated the prompt service and quick repair
after months of researching our pool and landscape remodel project 5 different quotes  ideas and quite frankly a lot of bs we were referred to az pools and landscape
some pros are that the grounds and apartments are maintained nicely there is a park next door good for walking your pup and there are all kinds of stores around the corner that are convenient
my experience has been similar but worse its a pity i didnt see similar reviews when i found the company on yelp
i highly recommend them
we complained about air conditioner microwave dishwasher and nothing was done for a month
he didnt even let the agent i was about to talk to introduce himself to me
we used 777 movers for our move
so i okd to use old ones
had roto rooter come out for a flood on our first floor
arizona air services did an excellent job of cleaning the air ducts and dryer vent in my home
i couldnt have asked for a better experience
i told them i was hearing a sporadic loud popping sound accompanied with my door freezing midway
and the cooperative concept of gangplank is really revolutionary
excellent work  will definitely be using them again
i called cosimo and he gave me great personalized attention
the sliding glass windows they installed in my new custom home were of very poor quality
left us the choice of paying 150 for one maintenance or cancel without any compensation
we invited the hill group to pitch their services to us mainly because of the gleaming reviews we found here on yelp
that being said i know what it takes to move a home and these guys did a great job
i only wish my other projects had been this smooth and professional
ryan and josh were extremely knowledgeable and professional the work they did looks great and all at a very fair price
i was in the market for a hayward sp3400vsp variablespeed pool pump
the staff then let me know that the prior resident had gotten robbed and bought the heavy duty door himself for safety
he did inform us that wed probably need a whole new hot water heater in 34 years which was a nice bonus
i love my two bedroom unit and i love how quiet the community is
i have worked with them in the past and i have had an oversight of many of their projects
although i have given laings five stars i would not have given myself that as i was very fussy and always emailing also i should have included a door between the kitchen and the hall  do not employ me as a designer
ever since this company calls me every day multiple times a day
andrew is so knowledgeable about plants and trees and he has a great eye for design and space planning
thanks to the amazing staff i have an amazing lifestyle with a very inclusive community of neighbors who truly care about each other
3 the upgraded apartment includes painted cabinets painted counters and laminate wood floors
this is my third time using barefoot for carpet cleaning
was a complete pleasure to work with
he wasnt pushy he actually listened to my ideas offered some suggestions and the end result is a great looking yard
no fearmongering or upselling
jason was able to quickly diagnose our leak and fix it and clean up after himself
we recommend him to all of our friends and family members
unfortunately they were unable to service my unit due to the structure of my building but the text made some adjustments to the settings and my unit is already running 100 times better
lets be very clear here
the customer service was stellar
its overly priced and a constant fixer upper that nobody is willing to fix
as a result on 652015 i terminated an account that i had maintained flawlessly for over seven years over a dispute of 1500
quality tint and the display was really nice
kinetico install was great
this is one of the cheapest apartments in the area
that made a huge difference
i emailed geoff about a drip system leak in the front yard and the palm in the back needed a quick trim nothing big but it needed to be done
very disappointed in verizon
use anyone else but them
thanks legacy air
our credit report didnt expire until the 12th of the month
no matter how cheap the rooms are just walk away
my floors are now warped
two friendly men greeted me answered all of my questions gave me tons of helpful information and quoted me a price with 0 pressure
i was so unimpressed he didnt take the time to understand my needs and match me up to the right phone
the previous tenant of the rental house we moved into spoke very highly of terrawest and how responsive they were to any maintenance problems he may of had
they do very high quality work and at a very reasonable price
other companies that i used i needed to call to see if my pool was even serviced because the work was so bad
its my 20 and personally i was raised to do what i say i will even if it turns out i was mistaken about something or something else comes up
the areas around the dumpster have trash all around them as well as broken glass
well done j2
its almost time to open the windows
however they stayed all day until the job was done and done right
i am extremely pleased with the service and expertise provided from koby
this was new years eve
its been over 100 degrees and they took their time to get the claim in and completed
they are quite pricey as my windshield alone cost 200 with their best 75 tint
the carpet was almost instantly dry after they finished due to all the new equipment
this morning i got a phone call at 710 am from water resources international
i will recommend this company to other but with the caveat of what we went through
its a very clean hotel with an indoor walkway to the other towers and to the mgm grand and tastefully decorated
found this guy at the right time
the other complaint would be the emergency maintenance response times
the property is wellkept and is usually pretty quiet besides the noise from the freeway traffic
my house turned ten this year and ive had several issues  my sink my toilet my garbage disposal  all at separate times
i was struggling with how to get moved into my new rental home
monday rolls aroundi call first thing 9 am  told to wait again as they review my file
if there is anything i can do for you let me know
but id call cotob without hesitation
why should i respond to their socalled private message
upon move in the place was immaculate
i called air done right and after 30mins the technician came
they took 6 weeks to deliver our furniture after the first date we gave them and blamed it on the summer season
i moved at the end of july and just got around to writing this review
first off no maria
we see this lack of character every day from fast food restaurants to hospitals
called her prior to dropping the bed off too
when i filed suit to try and recoup some of the 200k they have cost me in damage to my home they replied by filing a complaint to the county over chicken coops that they ran power and water to without a permit
i went in at 5pm on saturday 9th of january 2016 thanks
i proceeded to sign up over the phone requesting a 3 bottle delivery
they gave us our keys anyway without a walk thru or orientation
i would not use anyone else
after rescheduling installation twice were patient we discovered that the internet doesnt work at all
they promise but never deliver
i used to drive way up to rock springs to get pie now i have found a pie treasure closer to home
i got fly and other kinds of insect in my apartment
we walked around for about 10 or 15 minutes and the only welcome we received were a few glares to keep our grubby paws off their expensive crap
to be honest i was not going to take no for an answer
washer machine leaks water
during my almost 2 year stay here these are the things that we experienced our apartment was not ready when we came in on our scheduled move in day because the maintenance team got the wrong apartment ready
the shower door was also relocated from another location
pool fence has been up for 3 months and i have zero regrets on using the fence without the self latching gate
this is the best apartment complex ive lived at
we called joe and he came out and after a few tests quickly identified the problem
very professional service
i could see my rate going up if i was adding faster internet or other features  but my internet hasnt changed in a year and yet my rate has gone up three times
what company offers such friendly and honest service nowadays
ever since its all about nickle and diming the residents here
his price after evaluation was 1700
i got the phone working and didnt end up buying anything
the are like all the other onsite management companies all terrible
its called their time standard
the installation couldnt have gone better
lady in billing told me she fix the problem and gave me an amount to pay
i got a call from them after my disappointing trip there
sometimes the maintenance guy himself leave it open
i drove all the way from summerlin to floor  decor because the guy installing my tile recommended it
i tried to call the moving company at which point he opened the moving truck and begin throwing our belongings off the back of the 18 wheeler no ramp
so luckily the cabinets were paid on a credit card because of that the credit card company saw the pictures and evidence as well as quotes from other companies to remove the awful work and install new ones properly
who filed complaint but because tech that fixed my ice maker didnt put in his notes that he touched it they wont fix it
i forgot a box in the apartment and i didnt have a maid service come in and do a professional cleaning
my first question is who monitors these people
any and all future door business will be going to neal and his crew
so i end up having to call on this twice
the service here is atrocious
they were very professional and just all around good people
jesse and his ground crew were very professional and attentive
shocking since its been nearly a year since anyone has done it
he was friendly and very efficient
it ran all day and night and if lucky would get to 77 degrees by 500 in the morning
police are here all the time
he was comfortable with the  movers and said they did a great job
so i rush home on friday and no show again
he doesnt even have what he paid for  which didnt work anyway
all of the movers were friendly and a pleasure to work with and the price was reasonable
lastly the head manager who does a decent job and is rather helpful while hes on the clock is a slightly different person in his free time
the ambience was hella chill
as sometimes happens computer glitches seem to bite me often
i usually dont leave reviews but i felt that i had to for the services provided with my garage door
well we were very wrong
he went the extra mile to wash down the work area afterwards so you didnt hardly know he had been there
rep stated i was first on the list to have service turned on by 8am on 93
so common i compared the exact same model to 2 other propertys
my furniture was carefully layered with moving blankets then shrink wrap
i have been a resident of vaseo for three months now
after our previous movers who we booked and paid a deposit for weeks in advanced bailed on us the day before our scheduled move allstar metro movers came to the rescue
no joke best locksmith service in the valley quick efficient on time and affordable
i do not recommend
had my move schedule for today 9172014 sent conformation email last week and spoke to the clown over the phone
they have an attention for detail  and easily dealt with my type a personality
adam had to make some minor plumbing modifications but he still had the pump installed quickly and only within a couple of days of our initial call
will definitely call them again if i have a problem
this is the first ac company that i can trust
all the repairs and installation of the compressor saver were accomplished quickly and efficiently and stuart was just a very cool guy
what came out of that trial was 1 style attempt a minor modification and then i was rushed out the door on account of the salon closing at 5pm
both at this location to sign up with internet and also had tech jason helped resolve our problem with our internet went down they even have sunday appointments too
this is my recommendation
i totally depended on yelp reviews when deciding on going with david and im not disappointed
100 will use them again
the links hotel is great and my first choice to sit outside on that thing rarier than a nessie sighting a sunny day in scotland
speaks volumes that the owner is willing to get his hands dirty in a business that he started from his own experience as a loader
i have logged in several unrelated reviews since i wrote this one and at no time did i notice the comments from eli reaching out over 7 months ago trying to make this right
yes you heard me the entire day
they were thorough courteous and very neat
there was no noticeable difference in power or gas bills however
your animals are not safe in this community disease and safety concerns please dont put your pet in harms ways
getting something fixed is a total pain in the butt
unfortunately i was going to have to replace the outside unit
we now have all new doors drawers pull outs hardware etc etc for a huge savings compared to a full replacement
as long as youre not gaming it should be fast enough to watch netflix
totally recommend parker door and tanner our service person
very happy with price and prompt service
i am extremely satisfied
scott delivers on his promises
the drivers told her that she had signed the form
they were delayed a little by their vendors it was not their fault but they took care of us anyway and us a huge discount
they showed up on time and did a superior job
however he found he indeed had the right master key for my make and model in his kit
patterson remodeling came into my house after a water damage loss and they did a fantastic job with everything
matt perling was incredibly helpful and knowledgable
one maintenance guy went so far as to remove them to solve the problem not a good idea
you repeatedly mess up my bill
instead i had to track down another company and have them come and do the work
they came to the house and provided a bid but could not perform the work for nearly 30 days
he was professional and worked at a fast pace
scheduling gave me three dates before a tech came yesterday
instead of fixing our problems he ended up causing more problems for us
so i politely said actually never mind youre not very friendly thanks a lot and as i was hanging up the phone he yelled f you
i smoothly scheduled an appointment over the phone with rick the owner
they are a bunch of crooks
when i got the call from their rep about the nature of the issue i was taken aback by the problems
trust me look elsewhere
i feel as if we would have been just fine looking around ourselves
from when we first put our deposit down to the end of the job was only 2 weeks
so if you have money to waste you will not be disappointed with atlanticatlas
the air was constantly getting shut off the water was constantly getting shut off and the maintenance staff would lock the laundry room whenever they felt like it regardless of whether or not clothes were still in the dryer
naturally we sent a professional to take a look at the situation
i really had no idea of how or where to look
i will definitely be hiring them again for another service soon
they vary in price and quality so be prepared to search a little bit if you have something specific in mind
i have been notified via email by alexis brown that resident parking is on the 2nd and 3rd floors
you will not find a nicer guy than brian bk
any business that would knowingly employ a man that threatens women with physical violence while driving their vehicle and representing their brand is not a business to be trusted
they also have a bb court and a decent fitness center
very pleased with the professionalism care  and love this company provided made packing and moving simple hasslefree and zero stress
i have all my letters and replies just in an employee begs to differ
im so happy with the service and would highly recommend it to anyone in this situation
weve been without cold air for almost a week now and in this vegas heat thats not good
my husband called someone over who clearly was not at all interested in helping us
im sad to give sonoran vista this rating because we lived here for 13 months and loved it at the beginning
ill be calling you guys real soon
i think these guys are working on commission and take advantage of home owners
needless to say this was a tough job
they even included the exclamation point on the invoice
frequently when companies suffer economic setbacks they wonder what happened
thank you so much adam and american builders for your attention to details and for delivering two fantastic pergolas at such a great cost
i am extremely pleased with the new unit  one hours commitment to me as a valued customer
sean the plumber was very courteous
wasim does a great job managing my property in las vegas
john and his team are great
these guys did an outstanding job with our move

this is easily hands down the best employee verizon has
ill just start by saying i wish i would have read the yelp reviews prior to going to moon valley nursery
sami was always very real and never put fluff around anything
you cant beat the convenience and location but you pay for it and to the staff you are just another
it was just what we came for and at an amazing price
the carpets look amazing better than they did when we moved in
mike s henderson
comes with 4 towels2 hand towels 2 washcloths
i was out 20000 today for my washer and 100 last year for my hydrant
there is a yoga studio in the spa and while the yoga class was nice it was nothing extraordinary
staff was very knowledgeable and helpful when i could get help
got all of the stains out of my carpet from the previous owners
would recommend this company and i hope to continue my relationship with them
they said that there was almost no chlorine ph is too high so the chlorine would not work acid needed to be added
i love how you can deposit cash and checks through their atms
had a couple rooms and a rug done this past month
jerry went right to work and answered every question that i asked
if i were the business owner i would be very concerned of this
he aint gonna come out and fix it
the project included a travertine patio hot tub pad firepit and bbq island
go with these guys
great family business
the called to set up the appointment immediately
my son lives at these apartments and i stay some weekends
ed did a very thorough home inspection finding issues that we didnt even think to look for or ask about
evict this person
rent is cheap
great customer service
they were both so welcoming and helpful
he didnt show on one day he said he would he didnt show the next day but text me at 130 saying he was on his way
this also was not done
i warn anyone who is need of plumbing services to stay clear of h jacks and i will continue to pursue the recovery of the expense of the botched service call the clean up and the replacement of what was a perfectly good floor
we will definitely be using energreen again
im very happy with them
sales is the only reason im giving them 2 stars and not 1
no prewalk through c extreme urine saturated carpeting d mildew in both bathrooms e substandard repairs to downstairs bathroom ceiling f  substandard repairs to grout in upstairs and downstairs bathroom tile g torn carpeting by front door
renters let me just say id rather have myself and  my whole entire family die a long and terrible death before renting from this company or colony american homes
she delivered on all of her promises she communicated clearly and timely and her work quality shined through every step of the sales process
they denied only to find out they did once i performed an audit
the verizon 611 technicians two of them that i called from the parking lot after walking out the store were better trained but did not understand the idea of failure and statistics
we trusted in her integrity to be there locally for us when we couldnt
we enjoyed working with her and were glad that we used her for a second time
they were once the best
keep in mind i live 45 min away and never come to this side of town
wow what great service 1st call garage doors gave us today
he takes both of my phones and immediately removes sd and sim card from old phone and places in the new phone
you need to be active
lobby is nice and inviting
they worked around the security grate and did a fabulous job
it must have taken short of a jackhammer to remove the cement and my cat had to live with all this coming and going without telling me they were going to be in my apartment
i can already tell a difference in my hair and skin than using the horrible water that vegas gives us after 2 months of being in my brand new house i already had build up on my shower head
but to be honest they come in and fix it
i would give zero stars
he gave me free home estimate and suggested i check in with other companies
i was skeptical because we all know how easy anybody can write a false review to help out a friend
he was very cool and it was great picking his brain for great tips on how to sharpen my knives on my own and to learn about the differences between the knives they had in stock
jon was quick to respond to my house
we had a walk through and we were told to fix a few minor thingsand we did but then 75 of our deposit was taken
my carpeting looks like new
he came out on time explained to me about the stains on the carpet was very honestnot pushy at all not your regular carpet salesman
these guys were very professional and courteous
only cash and money order
i have checked and done price comparisons with other ac companies and he is the best
jeff chavez and gilberto were fantastic
the staff is so pleasant mary not so much
anyways all im trying to say for future renters is when your lease is due you probably will have a fee of 250 and up for general cleaning shampoo carpet and touch up paint
he wrote her up charged on several items that are totally bogus
once i had gotten there the aforementioned man working at the desk quite literally berated me in the office for trying to figure out how to pay my tickets online to get my car released
they are easy to get in touch with always respond quickly show up when they say they are going to very professional etc
she said no he is contracted out
called vendor when appointment time passed no response
instead my wife decided to double up on repair men for tuesday and have the ge repairman comes out and switch out the new motor with the broken one
what a changei always dealt with joey and his crew and was given a customer service however with the new crew that is certainly not the casei was trying to purchase venetian plaster and i have always purchased my colorant separate since i have a certain color that i want to achievewas told by james that i could not purchase colorant any more and when i tried to explain that i have been doing it for years when i dealt with joey however i was rudely interrupted and told that joey didnt always follow the rules and maybe thats why hes not there so to badi then asked about the venetian plaster and asked the price since i have a contractors account and was told without even looking that there was no discounti understand that every business has policies however i would suggest that james attend customer service classes because i have never been treated so rudelyi guess i will look elsewhere
more ice cold water days with no hot water than days with water then its scalding management tells us they dont know what to say theyre working on it but weve gone through this for months on end
im at the point that im going to start being an irritant to the politicians that have been protecting these scumbags and forcing us to accept their fraud and abuse
we thought about it for a few days and decided to give them another chance
easily my new goto for any other work i need done
btw after providing them not 10 days earlier a copy of my rental insurance at their request or pay their insurance premium they asked if i had my own renters insurance
our contract detailed every aspect of the job and the day it was to be done and the timeline was completed as outlined
if i cant get someone to help me in the store im not confident that i will receive help once i get my appliance at the house
i was very pleased with their office staff and technician and was relieved that they were honest
i never considered this home until now
this installer told us he would be out to replace the drywall
they told me what to expect from the cleaning and i couldnt get over how great the carpet looked and smelled
he worked hard and did a great job
if this new group really did buy out her debt why arent we all being compensated
it is 100 unbiased
i wish i could give them a 0
these arent professional craftsman that pay attention to detail as if they were running their own company
this is more of a review of the office staff as the actual movers never made it into my home
hopefully our legislators will so repeal the grandfather agreement and allow roof top solar throughout the state
the teenagers and children walk around the streets and you have to drive as if you are in a third world country
i was glad did
she never called me back again
she left a piece of tissue paper on the bathroom counter and cleaned around that
i had already given my deposit for 200 yesterday
a nonsmoking haven in the heart of vegas
and to think i actually recommended them initially to friends
very professional efficient and thorough
5  their requirements for getting the security deposit back are crazy
i was shocked and called them immediately to see what was going on
steve called me back and let me know his plumber was at another house but would come by right after
remarkable customer service
he got the entire job done in less that 45 minutes
i actually learned a few things today he took pictures and video of how my ac and heater is working and explained precisely how well they are working and what i needed to be aware of for future maintenance
jason and izzy came out to my house twice to clear all the mess and left no trace behind
further he offers a lifetime warranty on his work tv mount in my case
i have gone thru 2 or three contractors who had hidden prices and did unethical work
it was also very dusty inside when we unpacked but maybe because we were moving from the desert
we all have busy schedules and i would have been understanding if they had at least called to tell me they were going to be late or needed to cancel however they didnt show that respect
would use brian and his crew again and again
hassle free and very easy to deal with
and valet didnt mind helping them load their car
they did such a good job i had them come back and paint the interior of my house and i was very pleased again
switched from iphone to android and made a lot of changes to my plan
very positive experience
i would not want this to happen to anyone
we moved out because of her and now somehow she has followed us
there were no marks or crayon or dings or dents or wall damage at all
i work from home so its important to have little back ground noise while im on the phone with clients
wont do it again
he even offered to take me to work so i can leave my car to get done during the day
my car looks like it did when i bought it in 2005
the staff is so friendly and helpful
my order was ready for pick up and the owner canceled my order because i wasnt able to pick up
the weeding in the gravel and raised plant beds
it was his job to answer my questions in a professional manner
the seating could also be improved
have to take these guys to courtis giving them a zero star an option
he was very personable and professional
i moved into the house in mid april
affordable and reasonable pricing too
so if you really feel like you want to use verizon despite their horrible customer service and incompetent employees then at least save yourself a lot of hassle and money by going to another verizon location where they actually have employees that know how to do their job correctly
his men did a good job but instead of removing the debris they piled it behind a wall at the other end of the house
to whom it may concern this person is not a customer
the office had even told me at one point to call back in a few days to remind them if it was not taken care of
his team was able to negotiate the best terms for us and we had no outofpocket expenses
they have the utmost integrity and will work hard from sunrise to sunset
they did not show up
plumbsmart has been out many times in attempts to fix the system but hardly any improvement
here youll find tile from various categoriesnatural stone faux wood ceramic etc
i have had my carpets cleaned plenty times before and they never seemed to really get the job done the first timeso i was skeptical especially because of the price being so great
they were extremely professional and actually cared about me and my personal belongings
very lenient pet policy no breedweight restrictions which is difficult to find
the only copy that i have seen is the one the installer had with him
i highly recommend this company and will not use anyone else again
this company touts that they are the lowest priced licensed mover in las vegas
totally agree with the other comments here
she makes the entire process as easy as it can be
that makes me think the person is either management or friend of management
cant seem to get a quote or any information from this company
anyways i love it went plenty of times there and had without exception always the most effective polite and knowledgeable service from any staff i ever dealt with which is truly great and sadly in this city not a given as you may have noticed
there were several other common areas that were not dustedmy baseboards were not wiped down like they said they would be
great service  very cooperative
i shopped around and found that not only was paiges plan to finance our amazing new home the best possible financial option it was also constructed in a way that considered both my credit history and future financial plans whereas other lenders didnt care to think it through enough to even produce a viable option
got exactly what i wanted
the common areas are all remarkably dirty the tables near the barbecue are disgusting the lounge chairs that have only been there a couple weeks are already filthy
also didnt ask about which room to deliver certain boxes
i felt awful but they were simply awesome
he called me 20 mins before the appt time
couldnt be happier
i do remember that for the appetizer we had ahi three way and that was really good too
i could not be happier with the service dustin provides
it will be devastating when i have to leave cleveland because this place rocks
he was always on top of things and went above and beyond in any way he could
close to everything on bell rd stores restaurants mall
they also crated my artwork and tv screens and protected my glass tabletops
these guys were professional
only 1 covered parking per apartment
i have been going into this store for years
we talked for a couple minutes about what i wanted exactly
bryan saved the day
dave of mountain ac came to my residence april 6 and made me feel at ease right away
even my european boss who is very particular about which foods he calls good said the meal halibut and beet salad was brilliant
scheduling was a breeze and their crew always showed up on time
great local company very affordable and competitive pricing fast friendly and professional service
what a great roofing company
he even knew a ton about the previous system that the last homeowner had in place
however when tried to do it a month later found i needed another piece of equipment for 2500
we have some water stains on our ceiling and were thinking the absolute worst
i called needed him out on pretty short notice for a very small jobwilliam made it work
they were very pushy with the downpayment and did not understand or respect the life of a military family
poor customer care
who does business like this
so far i love the difference our ro and water softener have made and if i wouldve realized how easy the process was i wouldve done it sooner
more than two weeks go by we hear nothing back and so we call to checkin and leave a voicemail
they did what they said they were going to do and did it when they said they would do it which meant a lot to us
the kitchen proved to be especially useful considering there are little to no late night delivery options by the hotel
they mentioned it would take a couple hours but my entire car was done in well under 90 minutes
the door lock is like 250 bucks and i am being charged for it
dirty dirty and inconsiderate
i would definitely recommend him
what is there to say about lowes that people dont already know
the worst thing about this place is the fact that they have a deal with a towing company kwiktow where they have the tow trucks randomly drive around the parking lots and tow residents cars
is there a lemmon law for retailers
he took ownership of my call and really took care of the situation when we had many issues with redelivery and haul away
the service had been going for some time and going well when suddenly my pump broke normally wouldnt have been an issue except for the fact i was hosting a pool party in less than 48 hours
placed a service call william came out as scheduled
handy had now changed my daughter 60 dollars
i would never go to them again
his team has always showed up on the scheduled day dtm calls the day before to confirm the date and time
brian put them back up like a damaged puzzle
i spoke with the owner who was willing to offer advice on things i could try before i had to call someone out just in case we could handle it on our own
dont settle for an apartment that faces the park
after they trouble shot for a while i get a call telling me the estimate is 1100 to replace a control panel
we wanted our garage windows cleaned as well slightly higher but still a fair price
they really helped me out of a bind
he was professional polite and personable
his quick response and professionalism is outstanding
the owner has not come back to fix itwhat a  ripoffyour prices are beverly hills for south central la quality worki am sick of shoddy work in arizona
the store really carries everything you need for home
the wrong color part came in so they shot me a discount and gave me a free sd card
we only used them due to filing a claim with our home warranty company
we are beyond ecstatic with the results and just so so happy to have a fullyfunctioning garage door again
chris immediately responded to my phone call fully answered  described the services  was experienced  knowledgeable
im looking forward to seeing what options get rolled out and keeping my business with cox communications
i usually dont write reviews unless a company goes above and beyond
what i saw was more horrific then the seamed damaged and defective rain gutter that was presented to me at a discounted price by a representative of city seamless rain gutters
terrible customer service
tg is now my go to guy for any lock needs
i have an appointment tom and looking forward to it thus far none of the other companies have taken the time to email me my estimate
i called christie and her team and they have taken care of every need from start to finish
after two days trying and a total of more than 1hr 30 minutes we got a hold of a nice lady who said that she could not help repair email access
its like they put a giant bumper sticker on the top of a hotel
this is a plumbing service that understands the word service
it took matt 45 minutes to cut the wall shut the main water off locate the leak cut the problem area solder and repatch the wall
when i called the dispatch was polite and professional
i had no clue that there were so many shapes sizes and costs to be considered and visited a couple of store in las vegas
the crew came on time and stayed until the job was done
theyre really convenient and do an incredible job
just had sonora re pipe my backyard irrigation system  15 year old inefficient system replaced with rigid pvc and balanced heads
note there isnt any reason for anyone to ever be rude or snappy in the first placebut i think you get the idea i have also witnessed miranda multi task with current and possible future residents with patience and a smile on her face
we didnt even back everything that was on our list
if you like quality work and a smooth experience granite dude is the way to go
they moved our entire office to a new location and were very fast while also taking fantastic care of all of the items being moved
millie  john listen to and fulfill any requests  are absolutely fairly priced
our roommate called the office while we were out of town to get it fixed
great fast service
i didnt have a choice in their selection you do
i really appreciate that about a smaller vanity business like this one
next day rolls around and i get a call from him at 1215pm saying hes running late and will be at my house at 105pm
shane exceeded those expectations and despite of all his work and short notice he was able to get it done within 2 hours
they tapped into the existing one zone that was in the front yard
weve recommended them to friends and they got the issues fixed
im a big fan of kiwi for a few reasons they do a great job
my previous pool guy let my rental pool turn to a not so nice pool
we would get noise complaints watching always sunny in philadelphia at 10pm on thursday nights and neither of us are loud guys
they are very sick men who get drunk every night and just throw there beer bottle every where and they are very filthy meni feel sorry for the person who has to clean after themselves
overall when you eventually get these people on the phone they arent concerned about customer service
plus he installed a faceplate over a junction box in the ceiling that had been left uncovered
being in the central part of phoenix this location is close to the 51 and the 10 the airport is a mere 15 minutes away and there is a lot of great restaurants and shopping within a 510 mile radius of these apartments
thank you aqua plumbing beckie kelly trevor  crew you are appreciated
keith is great
had to throw in another 5star review for camelback movingmy husband and i have used them on three separate occasions now and have been extraordinarily pleased each time
and to top it all off i supposedly had an outstanding balance on my lowes credit card for less than 3 that was never billed or invoiced to me
im going to refer anyone with a drain issue to call elliotts
me and my neighbors have made several complaints but nothing has been done
being that i was supposed to move in an hour i told the guy to come
okay so this was mine and my boyfriends first place together
i would rate zero stars if i could
i will recommend them every single time i can
thanks kevin and crew
the community is wonderful i love how small the community is and how safe it feels
i love coming here and siting on the patio it makes for a ridiculously romantic evening for you and your honey
selection is huge specially in session items they have a huge outdoor area with every single tree or bush or flower u can imagine
only wish i could open the window or the place had screen doors
one of the salesman raised his voice and said ikea
thanks  its good to know there are people who take pride in their work
i asked her to please look at my bill
the products restored are amazing
i was referred to deaton gutters by a friend who was happy with their service
this company did a repair that we learned was not completely fixed
the company is licensed bonded and insured
and with the shape my interior was in i really cant wrap my head around how quickly they finished everything
would definitely recommend sting alarm to anyone
i kept calling them to see when they would arrive
we were first greeted by thomas who was great answering questions and clowning me for my titans hat i was wearingno problem they do kind of suck right now
i also replaced several flaps in dog doors over the years but they constantly warp and let the air conditioning go right out the door
i had  a friend suggest i call schiller
the two employees were very courteous as well as efficient in their work
they sent the same 2 ladies to reclean the house one was named melissa and she was in charge with another lady that was assisting her they were called back because i checked their work after the first 4 hours and i told my bf to get them back because they did a crappy horrible jobthe landlord concurred when he came to check the house the first time
twice now i have rented my subdivisions clubhouse from icm
im a past client thats been lied to cheated etc
quick efficient and affordable as their name says
sorry no more of my business
i never heard back from full compass so i decided to call them again the following day and second rep informed me that they actually wont be receiving anything and product is discontinued
great customer service beautiful facility and overall awesome
if you value your life do not move in here
this place is well worth a visit and a great bargain for scottsdale
he was open to answer all out questions and help us find exactly what we wanted
4 faces away from sun
after getting numerous quotes and robbed by a contractor vicente of floors west was recommended to me by another local businessman
the woman who parks next to me ran her car into my car and the apartment building
i called them and they apologized and said theyd send him within the next few weeksthey never did
i will give the contractor 5 stars
where to begin
i spoke with maria to explain to her staff to wet mop my tile floor
our three man moving crew was composed of expert tradesmen
we are now looking to have our other upstairs bathroom updated
pest r us has serviced every home i have owned since and i have never had a problem
dont ever use this company it is a risk
there is so much damage and lost items that i called the company that does their claims for them before i even finished unpacking the boxes
we notated the damaged blinds and we put in a request for maintenance to come out and change them which they never did
well 4 days later the cooktop arrived at my home and a couple hours later a gentleman by the name of marty came to measure
i got a quote from them but because they did not have financing options available i used another company i would have used them otherwise
run away from this company
however the chesterfield staff instead blasted heat into residents apartments with central air
anyway i now see the ecowater systems at costco but because of my experience with all about water and how negative it was i would never get this system and would rather pay more somewhere else to get something different for our needs
these guys are great
it went way faster than expected and we ended up being done hours before we planned
love this place
i will certainly be making superb maids a regular service for me
you will not regret choosing keith as your loan officer
if your house is worth more money expect to get a terrible offer
the groundskeepers who work here during the day are nice and do a good job of keeping the courtyard and the common areas inside the apartment building looking nice
norman zheng is a wonderful realtor who is honest caring and takes the time to answer the questions or finds the answers for us
i will use imperial again and i definitely recommend imperial windows to others
i am the manager of a storage facility here in phoenix and i have to say the care nathan and sam took when moving one of our customers out was excellent
casey did an excellent job for an awesome price
they did the best job my ac wouldnt blow cold air and they were able to fix that for me
joel is a professional and gets the job done his  prices are reasonable   i am very happy with his service
its a quite community and its close to local shopping and my place of work
im so happy to be done with this company
i have heard of my neighbors complain about bed bugs and roaches
eric and sergio did the demo and installation in less than 3 days
my fiance found the room on a travel site and booked it for 55
i called and he came back out free of charge and fixed the problem no questions asked
had i wrote this review the day i received the item i would have given this place 1 star
i have had aaron and suzanna work on several projects for me including two 1920s restorations
we purchased a home a year later and had the chance to work with visionary to help us locate our home and buy it
if you email them with a complaint or maintenance issue they wont email or even call you back
these guys are awesome and id recommend them to anyone in need of a plumber
the property manager is slow to respond or does not respond unless he needs something from you
we were not particularly impressed with the associate we dealt with
we were super impressed and recommend penguin to anyone who wants fast and honest work done
so we decided to go to the casino around 1130pm and played about 300 worth of slots no waitress in sight anywherehad to ask 5 different employees for a waitress nobody seemed to be able to find anyone and after 1 12hrs an elderly lady finally appeared with a tray and i asked her to please come to our slots and take our ordershe rudely replied to me that she wont serve me because i wasnt even playing i told her she wouldnt know because she hasnt been around for the entire timeshe was soooooooooooo rude i literally could not believe it after everything we had already been through
thanks all pro nice job
do not buy a otterbox product at a verizon store
yes the net takes a few minutes to take off and put back on
they explain everything to you and always get back to you in a timely manner
2 need more meeting rooms
the installation had tricky elements or i might have attempted it myself
thank you verizon at tempe marketplace for dan
maintenance people are very kindif you can get them to your door
i just had to pay another company a couple hundred dollars to take care of the algae in my pool since platinum pool care claims they service my pool but all they really do is show up for 1 minute dump a few chemicals in my pool and leave a paper receipt they didnt know we were spying
salespeople were nice but something is wrong with their delivery system or communication
they are way overpriced
house hunting moving and relocating is never easy on a family or a marriage im glad rentvest was there for me and my families transition kamili was very professional and she did her best to find homes with my wish list in mind
he convinced me artistic iron works was the place to work with
got to hang out in the lobby while waiting for my race flight up all 49 stories of stairs for the levine childrens hospital
the representative came and gave us an estimate to do 1925 sq ft of tile
i then informed him that i wanted to reduce my minutes from 900 to 450 since i have not gone over the 450 in over 6 monthshe looked at my account and said that i should absolutely stay with the 900 minutes because i would definitely go over
i took the risk to ship my only one fob key to madison wi
im tired of killing roaches every night before i have to go to bed
john also repaired the crappy job the home builders did and was kind enough to explain to process to my husband
funny i hired another company to take care of the pool weekly and it looks fantastic
no doubt the best experience ever
so off he went very apologetically
its quiet and i feel safe which is my main concern
i highly recommend this family owned company
when we had questions both denise at the office and micheal got back to us right away and were great to work with
we used twenty20 for the first time this week and will definitely be customers for life
needless to say were looking elsewhere
the store and parking lot are usually very clean
they told me twice that i would not be responsible for the repairs
i was promised four times that the urgent message would be sent from the call centre to the technician and management
i would recommend them for everyone
my wife and i never felt any pressure to buysell from kevin
this is an update to my most recent review for sunking we were summonsed to court for the immediate eviction that was posted to our door
i really cant say enough about the integrity and all around quality of this company and their men
and it was a cheap and easy fix
they take things at their pace no matter what
didnt we want a state of the art hvac system for 16k plus no
we checked in and they first put us in a studio and then moved us to a onebedroom but until i complained and 2 hours later
as i mentioned i needed my upper horizontal tracks replaced along with my spring block repaired
their tech arrived in a branded truck and a clean white uniform
made an appt for 9am on this saturday morning
i will not be renewing my lease due to the fact im afraid my rent prices will go up again and its just not worth it
one day i counted my internet going down seven times and my tv freezing on the cable channel ten times and countless times i was back and forth unplugging and plugging in their equipment to reboot the cable channels and internet
one of the reviews came from a good friend who chr just restored their floors and i was blown away with how they came out
i said what about the inside of the garage
chris was efficient and knowledgable
look forward to fulfilling our contract with them this year and beyond
his crew did yeomanlike work and kept me informed of everything they were doing
he wasnt pushy or demanding he was very helpful
i replied you lied to me and he wrote if i contacted him again he would file harassment charges against me
i was shocked at the audacity
while 1 star may seem extreme as i did note a few positives the bottom line is that wave house was hired to do a job they did not complete
liz nelson chandler az
the plastic lining on my case while putting it on the phone so i tried to return
his prices are also super reasonable
the light pull cord on one of the upstairs ceiling fans was broken it no longer responded to pulling but the light and the fan still worked
charging for everything they can
was this all too good to be true
i explained again i work mf i have dogs and an hoa and i am not available on a weekend again for two weeks so no rescheduling is not an option
when we went to turn over keys i asked to have the move out inspection as no one had shown up
they gave us a reasonable price for fixing the leak and some cracked tiles
thirty minutes later i called him again
next day i called and left a message on paiges voicemail and with the receptionist
it was just a way for them to come out and make it seem like i needed more products
i was still asleep
its been a few months since the project has been wrapped up and everything still looks fantastic
i would recommend this company for studentsmaybe some young professionals but if youve got some money you can find a nicer place
she said no youll have to pay the extra fees for those issues
the second day was a continuation of preparation cutting branches masking tape and plastic wrap to protect windows and anything that wasnt suppose to be painted
almost as good as new and it had five years worth of dirt  cat vomit thank you snoofie ground into its nap
i even had one extra stop and sergio did that by himself because his helper didnt show up
guy came out unlocked a door for me then put in another lock i had
what a joke this service is
if i could give this place no stars i would
so just how the heck did i end up in a midsized community with a nearly completely carpeted apartment
would def use again
after it was all said and done the job the two ladies did in 15 hours was medicore at best
not only that they cost 13 what other plumbers were asking yet the work was perfect
communication was easy  email text phone whichever way i contacted them i knew i would get a prompt response
he is always kind and upbeat and very knowledgeable about the facilities
the 3 staff in the place were more interested in chatting and checking out heir own merchandise
he takes care with our tvs and helps decide if its worth fixing or we should just replace it
i enthusiastically recommend jay for his prompt and highly professional service
the buffet had great side items such as potatoes carrots a chicken roll beans but you still get 3 family style courses which included banana chocolate pancakes banana and raspberry french toast sausage gravy and the cutest little bite sized biscuits and this weeks feature hearty beef stew with the cute little biscuits
after using these guys for 2 months they are very caring punctual knowledgeable and funny thank you for a great experience
i was not home at the time of the cleaning but when i went by to check it was awesome
highly recommend this service and appreciate their assistance on a holiday late at night
there are things you have to weigh if you think you can overlook them then this place will be perfect
if you call the mortgage center line it goes straight to voicemail
its the contract
i would hire them again
id go out of my way to use these guys again
he was prompt pleasant and totally honest
ive lived riding a bike as primary transportation
i must say the installers were terribly upset because the previous installers had measured wrong thus the mesh was too large even the correct mesh had to be adjusted onsite in order to get it installed properly
joe is patient extremely helpful and willing to work with your timetable and budget
would not allow me to return gift cards that i purchased the day before
otherwise they might never have installed them
ultimately the home that we purchased was one that he suggested that we look at
horrible customer service and follow up
we got a suite on a penthouse level and it was comfortable roomy and clean
ac doctor technician came in less than two hours
a few areas needed additional grout near the baseboards and they corrected that as well
i would like to highly recommend mia dalexis
nathan f was the plumber assigned to our job and he proved very competent in what he did
well he looked at it and said that all we needed was a keyed cylinder added to the existing handset saving us money on both time and materials
suffice it to say they dont have a clue about customer service no apologies no taking ownership just a bunch of i told you sos
terrible false alarm rate
the management team is a group of slumlord wannabes
michael did show up as promised bringing two small catalogs and a visual aid for landscaping

so i called cookson doors after having kept the card from their sales gentleman michael for a few years
turns out i was a dum dum and didnt reprogram the thermostat but i really appreciated her followup to make sure they had done the job right

makes it such a joy to live here
while im sure its not her fault if stearns own agents are powerless to move an application through the machine of this bank over 6 weeks you should take your business elsewhere
phoenix transportation systems part of usa moving and storage was a nightmare
a high turn around rate in the office with people

a in my book
i was told to call back on a certain date to renew my discounts
the day we were referred to trico was truly a miracle we had been online searching through dozens of companies that we had doubts about

the gentleman on the phone assured me this deep cleaning would include the standard cleaning of countertops appliances etc but also the cleaning of the baseboards blinds light fixtures and that they would remove the washer and dryer and clean behind the unit and get all the lint

i just built a brand new custom home and out of the numerous companies and contractors that came in over the last 12 months anthony and countertop rock far surpassed all in customer service and delivered product
i had a great experience working with jorie turner at luxe realty
they came the very next day and did a great job
excellent reasonable service
when our kitchen sink was backed up i called around to get someone to come out

they did a good job with my carpet
business must be really good that they dont call potential customers back
overall a great stay
technician was actually early great price
we have been using george for about 6 months now and have been meaning to leave a review

when i did make it out to meet in person he even gave me and my family an outstanding breakfast recommendation where i had the best waffles i have ever tasted
the next day after our vegas arrival my husband brought our car here and they let him utilize their birthday deal pricing since his birthday was that week

sweettouch stands behind their service
great customer service
sam was very nice and knew what he was doing and had the pipes replace in just over an hour

everyone i have come in contact with have been courteous and very knowledgable
it took almost 5 minutes for them to seat parties even though there were a lot of empty tables
the parking is absolutely terrible here
today was the cleaners first day here and elisa did a great job
the other dog owners are great too
first off rene the estimator that came out was very knowledgeable with many years in the business and we talked at length about all the aspects of the job
just great service
the housekeeping and manager customer service is horrible through lsi
so i must add honesty to all the other positives i experienced with these movers
received my monthly bill and it didnt reflect what the sales associate told me sales associate lied to make a sale
waited a while for somebody to help me however that is acceptable at a busy time
my attorney is helping me on working on the case
we called the contact person from beebee and he made arrangements to come our two days later
it was a simple fix to unclog it but he was very polite and professional
he was very thorough having utilities checked for an all that too
gryphon had replaced about 1200 square feet of roofing in 2010  i called to set up an appointment for additional work the receptionist was very curt and rude
they set up an appointment with me right away
we have a toddler and 2 dogs and we all had to cram into a hotel room until the ac was fixed
they had great instructions for me to do after
its hard to find such detailed and personalized customer service
they have all the essentials and some extras
geri feifarek was our sales consultant and we also worked with designer jill morse
our windows and screens were filthy  screens had not been cleaned it years  now they sparkle
doug and penny at valley fire prevention were so accommodating to us
our realtor always worked with our schedule in showing us houses
others showed up and looked like they had no idea what they were doing
she has always been very courteousbut best of all knowledgeable
me ok how about tuesday
my wife and i were buying a new house and were going to need fencing around the property
oh yeah  the pricing of install was 150 a sq ft everybody else charged 200
if you are looking for the best go no further
not a big deal i felt he was very sincere in apologizing for the technology error
the receptionist is nice enough but it seems shes given way too much responsibility and often has no clue what shes talking about
and although gi will tell you they are costly we found their prices to be reasonable especially as compared with other bids we received also we especially liked that after the initial deposit they asked for payment only after each stage of the project was completed to our satisfaction
glad to be one of his customers
within the next 36 hours before our move in he was extremely flexible and accommodatingwe scheduled for saturday morning but bashir promised to call if something opened up
initially i had some issues with the cleaning and called to have the problems addressed
they are untrained monkeys calling themselves ac professionals  oh all the circuit boards are bad well maybe if you knew how to rehook the circuit boards back up
we needed a plumber to replace our pressure reducing valve a friend told me about colburn enterprise  best thing that could happen to us john came out check the valve  replaced it  asked use if we had any question on anything great guy  great service  great price i will be recommending colburn enterprises to all my friends and neighbors who might need a plumber
its hard to find an honest repair personbut thanks to yelp we found jeff
its not a big deal but its not a huge savings

i love the work done by greg bookcase barn door and wainscoting
i felt that was a bit pricey so i checked it myself
oh and did i mention unfriendly unhelpful staff  oh i did
he says with the 25 coupon 134
i am not a friend or family member nor am i being paid to write this review
and if that wasnt enough he assembled it in the middle of the aisle just to make sure that it was exactly what i wanted
look at a map read the website
i assumed it would get replace until i look out my door about 830 pm and couldnt see anything because they never replaced the bulb
they seem to start at 7am which can be a touch loud for that early but they do a good job
how do u not know if units are empty or not and take reservations for units you dont have
i felt very comfortable with them moving everything and would recommend them to anyone
such a waste
if you make eye contact with the employees and ask them for assistance they are more than willing to help
they did a flawless job moving this 720 lb unit into my home with care
the problem ended up much bigger then he had anticipated and he still stayed within the price we had originally discussed
this year the price is at like 800 for the standard suite and 1020 for the climatecontrolled one
do not try to move your piano yourselves
they never took me seriously when i lived there about it
the reason i gave 2 star is because it is truly better than some other small companies but it does not mean mozart is worth 2 stars
i highly recommend this company
woody came out about a month ago and took the measurements
im extremely grateful for their services because we would have been really out of luck had they not pulled through
i had an excellent experience with the brother team of jesse and alphonse
i would not recommend them to anyone for anything
i asked to see the work order as i know i mentioned this detail to treigh and they refused to show it to me
this is the last thing i wanted but if they dont want to take care of a customer then i have no interest in doing business with them ever
i think they were very unprofessional to the small customer
my hvac unit was not blowing hot air i received the phone number for atech from my local neighborhood message forum and looked them up here on yelp to verify the reviews
had my mothers taurus wagon done by him
cranky clearly didnt care about us
a year later we have yet to receive any refund for the fraudulent weight overcharge or broken items
they ran drip to the new trees added fertilizer and thoroughly explained how to care for the trees through the first few weeks to come
he got me all fixed up and did not charge me some outrageous amount
was easy to book and they worked around my schedule
they must be smoking sht here
i expected she was busy so waited a little longer
she gives me 3 options for a phone cover two which are plain black and hard plastic
we are trying to work with them but i will be taking them to court soon if nothing is done
their hourly rate sounded great but they nickel and dimed to me to death
cant this place hire some normal people
it took more than a half hour for the person to go and find someone to find the item in back
she was also great about helping me furnish my family room and dining area
online offerings are superior than calling in and talking to sales
lastly just remember that people only really take the time to right a review after a bad experience and typically out of anger
assigned them from home warranty and i tried to call to set up an apt and they have this long message and no one answers nor calls back
good with communication and thorough about emails and reminders
i was even willing to pay their 75 estimate fee based on the perfect reviews
the ac unit went out during the night
the yelp reviews seemed good but they didnt have an appointment for 3 days away
we had molly maids clean our home for the first time this past monday

excellent staff wow we were not charged any fees at move out neighbors soso decent lowpriced apartments near asu
no unsafe products
if you want the best please call david creed at alliance financial resources
i just want to walk in buy stuff and not have to say no thanks a dozen times
its sad cause this is honestly a nice place but they dont care
bought and returned items so many times that stores have you on a watch list
i would surely recommend to use this company
they picked up my call the first time they performed over 6500 in repairs at my home and i had a great experience with them from beginning to end
very friendly  knowledgeable he took the time to listen to my ideas for the project and made many helpful suggestions
this will prove extremely useful as i now go outside to dig my sewer main up and replace the corroded iron part
the lied and said it would be picked up next day
the house passed the mold inspection and we are very happy with their work
late review for job done in early july

i really did appreciate the promptness because my wife wanted the work done soon
i would definitely recommend

well when i called to get the moving company the manager was nice and all and said the the guys would be there after 2 and i was fine with thatthe day of the moving i called because it was after 2 and the guys were not there the person who answered the phone said they are finishing the job and will be there soon well 3 rolled around and no one came my husband called them and finally one of the movers called and said his manager gave them the address and they were on there way and they will be there at 430 they showed up then well they were quick but one of the dudes kept banging our furniture overtime he too it out and scratched most of our furniture and when we got to the other apartments they forcefully got my brand new sofa into the apartment but really badly scratched it that it looks like and old banged up sofa now and the colorful lamp i had well i had no clue till i looked underneath the stand that they broke that too and hid the stuff under the uhaul truck we had rented they said they would pay for the damage but haventwell they didnt charge me for the move but they sure ruined my furniture which is more then the move wasi would not recommend them and would not hire them for any other moves
in fact everyone was nice while i was spending thousands of dollars
we are new here in peoria arizona so we went to the yelp app for guidance
one vendor that i found on yelp actually would not return my calljust emailed me to send pictures and they would quote and their quote and correspondence was very unprofessional
the community is great as well i have met lots of friends through hanging and lounging around the pool on sundays
wish the excuse was better than the last job ran over
they are stuck in reverse
my apartment has been flooded with mosquitos from them too
i felt like they didnt care about me as a person or my needs and comfort
the company did call me that day and say if i let them move me tuesday instead of thursday or friday they would knock off what turned out to be 350
why did the saleswoman i spoke to previously not mention this
i would recommend him for any of your outdoor projects
not sure how that happened maybe they cant see

we purchased the majority of our lofts lighting from royal lighting back i 2010 when we were renovating
we did not want a pool but wanted to increase shade and to showcase a growing interest in succulents
it would take a day or two for the whole process the water needed to be drained from the old unit to lighten it and eventually get over my balcony and the second one was put in having a cousin the same complex is really helpful
i had gone two months with a cracked screen because everywhere it was over 100 no one was able to beat their price 85 and thought i was lying when i told them the price

delta is out to rip you off because they think they can get away with it
the consultant first of all could have turned the volume down on her voice several notches

visit their showroom they have good displays of work they have done
they are so quick to close repair orders that they dont bother to check if they are done

sympatisch viel auswahl und toller service
but she said her managers would call me to verify this in a half hour
you will not be disappointed

i stayed in that hotel for three months in 2014 and in the last week of december 2014 when i  asked the assistant manager misty to extend my stay for another one week she got upset and  was behaving very rude and in a horrible way she said you she cannot extend it because of the super bowl and all the events coming in to the town and if i do not move out on that particular date 1st january 2015 she said she will call police to evict me from the hotel
they will quote you one price over the phone but after showing up and doing the work will tack on charges for additional services that i never requested

i need you to pay at least the false alarm fee even if you arent going to take responsibility for the fact that your technician failed to mention the possibility of a required permit
each time though they went above and beyond
thank god i didnt give them 9k
weve been using ez flow plumbing for almost 5 years now
i just wanted to make sure i kept my word and write these guys a review
excuses excuses and lies
each time this was their fault their accounting errors
we really got twoforone here
honestly i cant even believe how good these carpets look
but i have found if i ask that i can return their call when i know my schedule better i dont  get called as much
i absolutely recommend them to family  friends
these people communicate perfectly
he completed the work within half an hour then showed me how to maintain the springs hinges rollers and other parts of the door
two rooms 3 bathrooms full kitchen errthang
its thick and creamy and doesnt require anything else but some ice
this is my home which i was in when they were doing the inspection thankfully
he was the only one that explained and listened to what we wanted
they are very reasonable with their prices and do not charge you extra for the little things ie
the management probably wont recognize theres a problem but neither would i if i ran the complex
franks pricing was fair and the service was exceptional
not ccs fault i dont think but just be aware
very shady business practices and condescending attitudes as wellbad combo
my electric garage door stopped working on sunday afternoon
many people may be charged this 190 fee and not realize it
they were quick and thorough and im very pleased with the results
on time  did such a beautiful job on my front and back yard cant say enough good things about these guys
he called the electric company to arrange them to come out also
i have now filed a complaint with roc
i try to support people and especially family businesses but this was the worst moving company ive ever used in regards to not preparing for what i needed
thanks al for the speedy response zach for the awesome customer service and the crew who helped them with this cleanup
not many people would do that or even notice but thats the level of caring their employees show
3 days later hughes replaced my unit with a new trane system in under 6 hours
the prices are more than fair
when i called to understand why my questions were met with rude condescending replies such as you are not a technician are you
it turned out that it was my fault
reasonable price great service
it prompted me to call az air duct for service
not their fault  they did what they could with the unlock technology available it just didnt work for what i need i called them to see if they had a fix available and i was told to bring the phone back in
i had to go back two more times because she forgot to had me sign other papers
hbo the networks and a hodgepodge of secondrate channels like tnt and lifetime
locksmiths are all over the valley
please ron just go away thank you very much
even after 7 years of collecting my money
i was sold wrong stuff and my parents were sold wrong stuff for projects
maintenance stole my laptop
put in 4 years ago by ace air
in supporting two iphones i wanted to see if i could lower my pay to fit our current needs as we dont need some of the features that we previously had
bottom line from the moment we called to set the appointment to the moment we moved the furniture back in our experience with cranmore was nothing but top notch
over the course of several weeks my wife and i interacted with the team through this cool little real estate app they use wherein they create curated lists for us to browse and then we curate and comment on those lists
husband and wife are very nice always have a great experience coming here
a new addition to her staff is a new maintenance man
these guys are great
this has been the most awesome company i ever had come to my house and fix our air in less than 2 hours
only one small cheap ikea dresser was slightly damaged and they offered to come back and fix it for us or give us a small discount
i was able to get everything set up from the comfort of my home
said pressure looked good and recharged the system
he was more than happy to show us a big piece of our countertop before we finalized the order
update i filed a better business bureau complaint as well which just closed without resolution as expected
took only about an hour and now my ac is blowing cold air
and was denied
now her landlord is trying to get everything in his name and apparently they arent being much help to him either
they took the time to explain general maintenance the functionality of the new openers and left leaving my garage cleaner than when they came in
i would absolutely recommend az on time moving to anyone
i am very happy
i think we need to take this to the bbb
he too protected the house with drop clothes and plastic
i had several issues with the business itself all around communication
nothing to protect the walls the corners the floor
he also pushed hard to get us what we wanted
they never got ordered so at the last minute they bought cabinets that were in stock and made changes without consulting with me
the payment wasnt due for two more days
bring your baby in to see rick and be secure in the knowledge that he will take care of both you and it
the tiles we chose were all natural stone marbella limestone travertine and marble

buying a house can be overwhelming but the friendly and knowledgeable team at neighborhood lender made it easy
and knew him to be a smart and honest guy
i was seriously impressed with how fast their communication was and how fast the issue was rectified
i called the next morning saturday to schedule same day service and was told that a technician would phone me within 3045 minutes of arrival
also i was very impressed with the crew that did the work and their attention to detail
she did an amazing job
pretty disappointed given the franchise name and reputation they carry and after reading all these other glowing reviews
i now rent out my homes and have the carpets cleaned between tenants
double checked their prices against home depot and other online venues and standard turned out to be more expensive
double the amount of what was quoted was used
i did a google search for a cleaning company and was very impressed with the reviews i read about pristine house cleaning
well my realtor friend reaches out to prolink protection and what he gets in return in shocking

when he entered my home he shoe covers to protect my floors
many people just dont care because it is not there home
in a nutshell i couldnt be happier with adams pool solutions
we were greeted at the door and the gentleman took our name
i saw this car on the internet  talked with mike kennedy  on the phone drove over 400 miles to see it
i paid top dollar for tint but it wasnt even close to a top dollar job
so much so that they will disappear in an emergency situation and on complaning will start snapping at you
by giving me options and explaining them i felt that brian was very honest and not trying to push services on me that i didnt need
they wanted to doublebill me another 1700 in early termination fees because i shit you not it says so on our computer
i want very badly to get this corrected for you and i will do everything in my power to make that happen
two stars because they canceled with little argument knowing they screwed up
ive had poor experiences with property managers in the past so when i was notified that a new company was going to be managing the unit i lived in i was concerned
always have been able to find someone to help unlike in dc
he was always nice clean and always had to be called back bc of an issue
they fixed my pool heater than no one else could figure out what was wrong other local companies call gentry for advice
i dont have the form in front of me right now and conveniently their website is down so i cant even doublecheck that
having said that i do agree with the previous comment about the way that sun creek is built
mark really listened to all my ideas and added some great suggestions that he put into a plan for my yard
santiago and matt came out and spent two days making the grout and tile perfect
everyone from the office staff estimators and installers have been very professional and polite
wish i could give more than 5 stars
so pleasant and helpful
out of my 7 stays ive experienced this problem the majority of the time but not every time
but rest assured  it is worth it
we set up my appointment on monday night and he was there the next day on time
bob would text with me even in the middle of the night and was just extremely kind even when we had a silly moment
jeff is the best
this is not the case at this particular location
so i had to spend fhe next 30 minutes calling other locksmiths
we were able to schedule an appointment within just a few days of calling
dont call these big chain air guys when you can have a locally owned guy do it better and cheaper
they have replaced the modem twice in the last year
what a great security company to work with
as far as the one negative review this man has on this sitethis was not the man that repaired my opener the man that repaired my opener was on it must be mistaken identitycheers
they nickled and dimed me for delivery and set up took almost an hour for a four person table
i like how i get the same team each time and the owner checks in with me from time to time to make sure im satisfied with the service
they are really the moving dream team
called sun devil garage door repair they came out today and a half hour later i now have 2 new springs and rollers
we called another company and paid a higher price just to know that we were dealing with professionals
even with the back window redo he finished up promptly
i started noticing some issues with one of my garage floors with peeling and contacted matt who immediately scheduled the repair on the floor
i have nothing negative to say about the hard working techs i have met through the years all professional and nice
very reliable and accommodating tooafter a high wind storm i needed an emergency cleaning before company came to visit for the weekend and ryan made sure squeeze in my pool cleaning even though he had already cleaned my pool that week
i can assure you that choosing caribbean pools will be the smartest decision you can make
love the arizona crew
dont forget everyone is valid in their own review opinions however just remember that a single person can find the cure for cancer or aids or anything and there will always be those people that ask how come they didnt find the cure sooner

do not buy appliances at any home depot
i tried twice to talk to her with no luck
i tried to explain to the management that i renewed online and the decal will be here in a few days
i would prefer to leave 0 stars
they quoted me 520 a sq ft for installation
prices vary but i think we were there during a busy week for conventions because nobody was cutting deals
he found no cracks and nothing wrong with my furnace
i think the fact that i bubblewrapped a lot of items before placing in the boxes helped
the crew arrived on time worked hard and worked fast but carefully in 100 degree heat
carpets look new price was fair
unless you have a stupid cat who likes to chew on them  anywho the installer guy is really friendly and during the initial installation there was one blind that was a little uneven and without prompting he let me know that they would be replacing that one
secondly he promises to be flexible and gives you terms for your apartment that he at a later date will conveniently forget happened and then charge you money for your apartment complex that you have already paid for
casey and team showed up on time and got right to work  they were careful with the items and did a great job packing and moving
it only took me a couple minutes to uncover this while looking around the attic so how the technician didnt see it and managed to leave a large pile of old ducting directly on top of it i am not sure

well it took three months for just the cable to be installed and sure enough we were charged for it the whole time
that was fine and it worked ok the motion detection was supposed to not be triggered by an animal under 100 pounds but my 40 pound dog kept setting it off and the cameras only recording for 30 seconds was a real let down
found them on yelp with the old location

his prices are extremely fair and i would recommend rick to anyone
i am as picky as can be
good customer service friendly and quick service
after going into the leasing office and complaining many times we asked them to remove us from the 12 month lease we signed since we felt mislead with security promises and quiet hours but they said we could only transfer
i was told no problem its done and i went and turned in our boxescables the next day
we checked in and our room was not ready
they use door jam protectors which is nice to prevent damage to walls and doors
this is our company of choice and michael our trusted electrian
to my surprise she told me that i was good and wouldnt need to pay one
at 2 we called and spoke to supervisor
they sent me a refund of 50 because they said that my carpet was stained and they had to repair holes in the apartment
i sent photos and the moonies said to let it go through the hot summer and it should perk up
the move was on a hot day and they didnt let that slow them down
as far as the company goes thats a different story
i checked yelp and saw the uniformly positive reviews for vacuums plus so i headed downtown by ttc schlepping the vac

she said she would call me by the 19th of marchtoday
this is the second time i have used this company
as a new person to the valley that has worked with many vendors in my personal and business life  these guys are great to  work with
so ultimately this first appointment was to just meet the guy that would leave my emails and messages unanswered for about a week before responding
he showed up on time did an amazing job and worked around my schedule
had dinner here
i dont understand that at all
i would be fine with that if they would take the fee off the other end if i was to use them
i am a very busy person yet i wanted to take time to write his supervisor a letter to thank them for their help
we bought a new house and had to have a gate installed and they were listed in the new home packet and with a referral from our masonary guy called them up and they were out for an estimate in two days they were very responsive when it came to every question i had and even suggested ideas to make our gate a perfect fit
jose from guardian came out when my downstairs air conditioning was not working and said that it was 320 because it needed a new motor
if it werent for gi haul i would never have made it happen thank you again for making this a good experience
this was a classic bait and switch in my book
at the entrance there is a sign that says private and gate to entice new potential owners to purchase into this exclusive community yet once you purchase you realize pulte will not close the gates and in fact encourages outsiders to use the parks paid for by the homeowners to try to snare potential buyers by making it look like a friendly family community
i talked to robin
so just 4 hours before i needed to leave for the airport i called muscular moving men and they sent a crew within an hour
ours went from 900 to over 2000 because we had more than we initially were quoted forwrong
youll have to climb over the gate or wait until a maintenance man with a key walks by
now dealing with my warranty company was a different story
mifflin ave is a quiet and safe street and just a short walk from biddles an awesome coffee shop and a yoga studio
three stars at best
on day of install tim showed up on time and ready to go
if you want a cheap price expect a cheap job
they were nice but i do not know if i will go back
i wouldnt recommend this company to anyone if that was the first interaction i had with them i can imagine how difficult the rest of the process would be
just stick things to windows doors walls etc
i may report them to the bbb
call this family owned business asap for a water softener
also i want to keep my business local as too many online retailers are killing jobs in smaller market brick and mortar
he is friendly
there are some estate sale companies here in las vegas that i will not go to due to their negativity and unwillingness to work with customers  this is never the case with jps

they were both regular seeming guys but look out  do not let appearances fool you

he gave us an initial price that was well below the cost of another company i had received a quote from
you also cant go wrong with the location
this is the place
instead they forwarded my email to the corporate office where the lady was extremely rude
please do not do business with this company if you would like someone who actually follows through on your first time appointment and maybe actually shows up
he had someone out the next day to discuss options and i decided to replace whole 20 year old system

and how there was no way anything was going to be damaged during the move
i paid 97 including tax to fix the lcd and glass of my iphone 6 my phone was fixed in 30 minutes

we feel that az rug co offered us an honestly priced rug and we were treated fairly by greg
we didnt have daily maid service which was fine except we had to buy our own toiletry because the management company provided amenities only for one day
this is unacceptable especially considering how much every resident is paying a month for these amenities
great company with excellent work
i am going to stay away from the pricing stuff but lets just say i paid about 175 per square foot after all the rebatesnet net
and we were hoping to hire the company for future cleanings but that were a lot of things that need to be worked out
mfg herbert weste

the only thing correct was the brand

i was in shock
they later claimed the street i had told them to take was closed which is why it took so long
still want to live here
contacted ron on having my pool replastered
they fired all maintenance and office staff when the new company took over which was a huge mistake
we havent had any problems with noise or parking
he had a very unprofessional demeanor as well
we were allowed to break our lease in the event new qualified tenants signed a lease
he said the classes offered at the vinery provide a comfortable environment where learning is simple
had bit of an issue the 1st time coming here but rick fixed the problem and made it perfect
so far i have had zero complaints
the two gentleman that came to help were both very friendly and professional
the owner was part of the crew and he worked the hardest
the bottom half of the refrigerator freezer still had water spots and splashes on it
theyre also very fast to communicate
spotless apartment rent always on time and rules followed to the t there is no reason for that behavior
what im reviewing is the efficiency of their employees and an actual visit to this brick  mortar store
the last issue was the timeline
the owner came right over with another machine and helped finish the job
he discovered that a couple of parts had failed in the new hvac system and he immediately began working on getting these parts replaced
you will not be disappointed
nothing they do is professional by any means
i walked into walkers furniture ready to buy
the indoor temperature displayed on the thermostat began to creep up slowly causing a mild internal panic as i thought of the idea of trying to sleep in the rising heat
i wish i did not delete our convo it would have been comical to cut in paste the whole thing
i could have a house for the amount to of no way i spend here
i called and they were at my door in 30 minutes
juan kindly walked me through the process and scheduled a time for the repair on a weekend that fit within my hectic schedule
there should be a zero star

adrian came and fixed the problem immediately and also assessed my spring and rollers with good recommendations in the future
i have been using prestige chemdry for about 5 years now and i couldnt be happier
maybe that old stove too
we sat for 30 min with no food
it is might near impossible to get in contact with anyone in charge here
not 100 perfect but who is
ok now the deal breaker the mattress ours was a serta 99z i checked because i felt along the ouside and i could feel the springs nearly poking out the side of it
they said it would take an hour to fix and they even beat the clock
the last time i waited for and hour and a half
i recommend you consider management that cares more for your comfort then tricking you with a pretty pool table couch  pillows in their office
at 900 am i called and spoke to christina
one last dig at a former employee with more knowledge skill and talent than he will ever have in his life
in the loan hunt process my loan officer was initially quite patient and courteous
resident from 062016 to 022017
now this is all to be expected due to the fact that the crew was cleaning without any water
the room was huge and i loved having a fullsize fridge
one tellerdiana is more interested in flirting with the customers than actually getting the 15 people in line taken care of
wifi signals are strong but the internet is very slow
if youre  looking for monthly pest control they are best in town
our home was a mess after the tenants moved out but sparkled after loretta and her gals scrubbed and cleaned

the unit cannot be repaired anymore and quoted the price for a new unit at 9900
the car looked great and i left with a big smile on my face
he said they were incredible friendly and did a fantastic job
not even a courtesy call to say i didnt calculate my time well on previous appointment so ill be late took the afternoon off to allow for their 2 hour timeframe
rob was very polite informative and most importantly competent
the same roller that i had them replace twice was still busted
i am glad i did  that i can assure you

best moving service ive had in my life my
paying by the week is okbut can be a bit tough if you are like me and barely making it financially
i  it has been a constant nightmare dealing with this lowes which can only point towards a very poor management team both in install sales and overall
i just moved out of here and i am so happy
maintenance said they would come to take the door knob and fix it but never came
they moved us and showed me charges like 4 different 35 charges added on to my hourly charge
better yet avoid them altogether
ive had the opportunity to stay at the signature twice now and both times have been phenomenal
i had a good experience with chimney masters
as a busy realtor i dont have time to go back to lowes or home depot for multiple trips until the key  copy the  client gave  works
when i moved in everything looked brand new
i was reluctant to give him money up front since he had out of state plates and phone number which was suspicious as well
they lie about giving notices and create documents to cover up their mistakes
read their review on yelp stay away unless you like dealing with a controlling bossy witch
had them come in to do spring cleaning session on the living room and bedrooms and loved their service
he repaired our garage door within 24 hours of our initial conversation
they look like art work
what impressed me the most was his thoroughness and his communication skills
that was on july 29th and i still havent heard anything over a month later
he was put up all the corner guards so as not to scratch the walls with the hoses
i have a rental property and will diffidently be using them again not only for the rental but for my house as well
in his remedying of the situation

the only thing i miss as with the hotel is the damask stripes so i know the direction of the bottom sheet and the extra set of king pillow cases
she would say one thing then retract what she said then get confused in the conversation
i found out the way that is done they used my name in a improper way in a referral program
at 8 weeks i heard nothing
they took a bit but feel it was because they wanted to be very detailed on our until so give them kudos 4 stars
if you do use them call around and get many quotes
i was told that they needed to order the couch and it would be 6 to 8 weeks

he put us in touch witherx emergency restorations for repair of the water damaged ceiling

the drive thru is a nice touch
perhaps it was a coincidence but hopefully the investigation will find out
he managed them expertly and they all did a very professional job
having been raised in a family homebuilding business back east at a time when integrity quality and pride of workmanship were part of the skilled trades past down through the generations i seek these same attributes when my home needs attention
and i didnt see a bar anywhere
no help from office when we flooded i had to call corporate i cried my babies nursery and bathroom and half my living room were 2 inches in water
miraculously the prices were nearly identical to those on ebay for literally the exact same items
i will always use arturo for every issue if any arises at home
overall this was a really pleasant experience and i would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for tree removal
despite having that report for more than a week the person they sent to our house to do the transfer inspection appeared clueless as to the repairs that had to be made
i was completely sold with this company and all i was waiting for was a quote
unsupervised misbehaved children
he started when he said he would completed the job very efficiently and my floors look awesome
we had a front yard project and a backyard project we were looking to have done separately
the communication is miserable
hey guess what still no box ooo man i guess they dont want there boxes back
i must say i was highly impressed by the quality professionalism and attention to detail to every aspect of this task

i am happy to report that they sent someone within one day to power wash the walkways and the grassy areas have been much more pleasant with the cooling of the seasons
started our project in february and its now nearly july and they still havent finished
if it turns out to be these cunts stay clear

three words to describe this apartment  luxurious   home  security  i love living here
saturday i received 2 calls in the morning advising they would try to get to me in the afternoon
my wife and i used their services
we fight hard to have a good reputation and referrals have a big impact on that reputation

they gave me a timely quote and scheduled me for my repair showed up and did the work when they said
cheri is very quick to reply to all of my emails and any of my maintenance requests have been addressed within a few days
this is an unprofessional unorganized dishonest group of people who dont follow instructions dont honor their word and simply dont care about their customers or work product
i went to the first help desk several items draped over my shoulder and asked if where i could park was okay
over the years weve engaged scott and his crew to perform a number of major tasks pertaining to the pool  draining and acid washing replacing bulbs in underwater lights and maintaining a somewhat complex automated cleaning system
my guess is that people who reviewed about their deposits not getting returned are butt hurt for trashing their apartment and not get refunded
even though we waited past the 1 year warranty mark for free service they also waived the service fee for us since we never got our first free service visit
they scream obscenities blast their foul music inside the complex  only appeared on my doorstep after a burglary had taken place coincidence
i posted a before and after of the yard in the photos above
i did get a call but missed it so i called back
its disgusting that this is the way they treat people
they were straight forward with the price
it seems they do not have enough parking for all of the apartments they have and if you are not home daily by 5pm then you will not have parking at all
he truly took the time to listen to us and to understand the look we were going for
i asked the manager jandi if she could do the inspection after 3 pm when my husband is home

over labor day weekend we purchased a new sectional
i am now going to call a professional plumber be ware of these folks they are not reliable
in past year or so they renovated and had a change in management and now it is the worst bank to deal with
the company we already use sends two people and they average 15 hours for 65 that includes basic landscaping
the appointment was on the dot love it i canceled another peoples appointment after them because sales was very straightforward and explained all my questions
its also pretty crappy they only come four days a week and not on weekends when youd probably have more trash
i called anoter plumbing company and they quoted me 1450 for a 50 gallon water heater and told me i didnt need a permit
he even repaired a couple areas i didt even ask him to do

they loaded us up and unloaded everything fast
wish id never refinanced my rental propoerty with schimdt churchill branch
the work was scheduled and we received a  reminder call confirming start date
cypress street did an awesome job and george is nice guy as well
you pay only for the time you use and a small fee for equipment  no hidden charges
of course it takes maggie s an employee to write a favorable review to get these guys off of the bad review bandwagon
a great resource for designers contractors and owners
they cleaned up after themselves
in turn they were happy and efficient and i was more relaxed confident that we werent burning up time and money needlessly
i had to fire blake and arrange to have the work done by a different person
bonus specialty coffee
i really like the details
roland and his team went above and beyond to assist and where extremely knowledgeable answering all my questions and even giving me advice on what would benefit me most
next morning i call them talk to customer service rep tells me that unfortunately our services cannot be transferred to our new house via internet
location is great close to scottsdale quarter and desert ridge
while we werent looking for a 15000 garage makeover the verbal quote was over 4000
ive called over a dozen times with no reply
despite their description they do not install ro systems that were purchased from someone else
they took a blank canvas and designed it into something special
i will not go into detail but lets just say it was a health hazard
the paint that was on the walls before was a builders grade paint that had not held up well at all and really wasnt applied well to begin with and now we have a beautiful finished product thanks to jack and his guys
there were still spots on the shower the tub was not cleaned and had muddy spots which were not there before
we started around 3 pm and finally about 6 pm he gave a quote for 4 different star ratings
parking is the worst
unless your nose is up against the car its virtually invisible
i had them also come out for a gas hot water heater issue and again was way over priced and did not offer me any reasonable solutions
so thank you admiral pools for doing such a great job with customer service and attention to detail
thats not going to happen okay then they agreed to send someone out a week later
the pool was promptly shut down and condemned by the city
they never showed up
thank you guys
i was a bit leery of staying at mgm for this business meeting but this really rates highly
worst customer service they were supposed to call me with quotes
its been 3 months and they continue to give us the run around about fixing our tile
they set up contracts and then wash their hands of your service
it was a false alarm
i wish i would have known that sooner
several friendly helpful salespeople are there to assist you cashier as well as people to break down the pieces and load it up in your vehicle
after months of phone calls and emails two refunds were issued
needed to get a mailbox rekeyed
first company said we should just redo our tile because he would charge 160 per sf to clean which he would use something that looked like a wire brush
i called bond ac  heating as they did a maintenance job on our ac in 2014 which we were very pleased with
if youre lucky enough to be within the service coverage area of barefoot pools look no further
bridges came to my home to help me get my new home office organized and put together
how hard it is
i called and let them know i would not be willing to schedule again and i wanted my money back
newman properties owner brenda newman works for the home owners and steals your deposit
their team was professional experienced compassionate and knowledgeable
yesterday no one came to clean my house
this included loading mattresses and wooden furniture outside the truck in rainy seattle area
this is a friday night of course and you cant get a hold of them over the weekend so i will be going nuclear on them monday morning
i contacted kyle to let him know about the damages and included multiple pictures
he was late for an hour but he was very apologetic about it
they deliver top quality which we have had such a hard time finding
but they just wanted to leave
i set up an appointment to get a duplicate car key stupid transponder chips and extra keyless remote
i had a very good experience
having said that i used to have more problems than i do now
the installers also shopvaced any drilling remnants and did a heck off a clean job
as a simple visitor here and not an owner i have to say i love these condos
the house is fairly clean and they are efficient
grounds no complaints here construction we love the granite counters and the cabinets are nice to look at but you can kind of tell that theyre on the cheap side
when i called back a was quoted over the phone based on my description of the problem so i made the appointment for replacement spring for the next day
arrived within a few minutes and was very friendly
i dont get these contractors in this town
unfortunately i was not able to help choose the mover because i was so busy with work
he didnt mind spending time helping me over the phone with no charge you will never see that kind of courtesy at all
these are definitely the people to call when you need your ac repaired
so solar go electric avoid southwest gas at all costs
the sky is the limit
the mistakes they attempted to fix made more mistakes
he even made a special trip so he could fix the grout by the door
griffin is outstanding by far the best agent i have worked with
i was thrilled
they took away his truck so he could not work remaining week
they called and gave me the estimate which in my opinion seemed excellent
geezcant believe i am even saying that
its almost as bad as indian tech support
i read a review below mentioning about dog poops i totally agree that was annoying indeed when i was living in there
they are getting new gates where the community stays closed after buisness hours
he is meticulous and treats your home as if it is his own
i contacted the owner scott he said he had terminated service in my area
confusing as ever
i will use rosales landscaping and maintenance on any of my projects
he said i wouldnt have access to the money until monday the date i was there was a friday because a person cant open and close an account the same day
the price was very affordable and the final product done by jorges crew is what i expected
to many businesses out there to choose from
word of mouth travels fast in the charlotte area
i recommend him highly
so we we contemplated holding off in order to save up
i dont ever want to move
i would consider moving back if they increased security  fixed the insect problem and got new management
in about 30min i had carpet that looks brand new
like they were doing me a favor
he would have to call me back
people who answer the phone after hours are not informed about how their own security systems work and did not know what fc meant on the alarm box
they illegally seized all of my and my childrens accounts  some of which contained my childrens death benefits and my retirement fund deposits in them which is against federal law
i especially like the pool in tower one which is specifically for adults only
the view is spectacular
i sure hope the cox managers see this review and change how they deal with customers and also train their employees how to speak to people
during the inspection itself ed make it very clear he was here to educate and help us in this process
we or should i say i took a long while to look at all of our available choices and was stuck between two different chandeliers
this guy deserves more than just 5 stars
it was easy to find with a decent selection
they did a great job with my yard and i would definitely recommend them
we live in vegas and no doubt at some time or another your ac will go out
new agents and brokers should know they want you to succeed
however we did just talk and sheila was very apologetic and offered a free ride
then they just recently stopped holding packages for residents in the office so they get left at your door
there service is horrible
they protect your stuff and the home its moving out of and into
since i hired him in the middle of april he only can one time
we have plenty of people who would actually think about renting from our apartment if the parking wasnt such an issue
many thanks scott and terry for a job done right
i will never ever ever live with mullins again
now i have to wait on management to replace it
it makes me wonder if the people who wrote the other reviews live in the same building as they dont resemble our experience on any level
i get the feeling they are running a ponzi scheme and it is all finally catching up to them
i highly recommend
i called my home warranty company fidelity and they called north valley mechanical
she was friendly courteous and she worked her butt off for two hours
i have never had cleaners come and not dust wipe down counters and do floors and bathrooms
well that is unacceptable because you gave us a max quote and you knew the address when you gave the quote so not my problem
brad absolutely knows his stuff and with that comes my highest possible recommendation for his service
hopefully this rate and review can get a response
daraufhin wurde er laut behauptete dass er seine  kostbare zeit verschwende und erklrte dass er fr das unterschreiben  eines mietvertrages max
being steps from dining shopping entertainment and more is just one of the perks
they didnt try to overcharge
if you live here now look at your statements10 for insurance charges for city trash etc
first let me say that i only have used their pool cleaning service so not sure how well they do with everything else
kirby and his assistant ashley were both very professional and very easy to do business with
hands down the best inspector i have ever used
while they werent the lowest bid they were the most comprehensive in their scope of work
they know every residents name a little about them and always act pleased when you ask them for help
every single complaint call you have with them majority of the people you talk to are rude and condescending
i have been to a few iphone repair places here in vegas and these guys are by far the best
another week passed i called and they said it is broken they cant fix it
even more irritating when they tell the cops their system has been down so theres no video to show
overall its a nice building though you have no reason to go unless you work there
at about 920am saturday morning i hear people talking outside my bedroom door
they are pretty illinformed
im sure to recommend this company to others they are professionals
the owner was really great to work with
kudos jeremy keep up the great work
police arrived unlocked my car and told him to get lost
it is true that management has changed  over the last year and this will always cause glitches  as new management gets situated and fixes the ills of the past
my delivery date was feb 25 with another clause it may be 710 business days after that date to deliver worst case they said
the quote was emailed to us within 30 minutes of when they left
i have lived at here for over 6 years
i would say if you want to use them just make sure you do your homework and check around before
i needed a place to stay for a few weeks while i relocate to las vegas
i never saw any kind of background check credit check reference check anything check
if i have any concerns with the yard i will keep everyone updated
welcome to the nines apartments where proof is anything the property manager says it is
overall this is a good hotel but i wouldnt want to stay here
i found this shop last summer and after they did an exceptional job on my hood i chose to go right back when another car reversed into my door last month
the staff seems to view that breaking their commitments to residents is ok but there will be no flexibility on the residents commitments to them
hands down california pools is the best pool company in the valley and i would happily choose them again for future project and would recommend them to anyone
they were absolutely amazing
the company reviews on angies and yelp convinced me there was not better firm to count on and they were right
wir wollten uns die kleinen macken in den mbeln ersparen die bei umzgen nur mit freunden fas unvermeidbar sind
very honest and helpful
we will look forward to working with him in the future
reallywhere was this guy the  first 10 minutes after i checked inmaking too much of this
mark came out as soon as he could without charging an emergency fee took the measurements and made sure the area was stable enough and would last until the glass could be replaced
this resort is not as nice as the normal places
i would definitely recommend his services to anyone needing fitness equipment repairs
im a minimalist and had a hard time filling my loft with stuff
if you know what you want and need a realtor who will be friendly to you and assertive to the other party ask for staci rullo
he was determined to get us in somewhere quickly to meet our time limit
the people here really make me lose confidence
it was pretty simple to schedule the appointment
im usually pretty picky when it comes to contracting with someone to do work on my home so i picked about 4 people to come and give me quotes
there is a huge lack of customer service occurring in this office
they showed up 3 hours late with only half a crew  so we ended up moving in a monsoon
i really wished that my first home financial experience had been this simple
i was the first person to live in my apartment
please stay away
very nice and friendly
good paints just need some smiles to go along with that
i also noted that the other estimates some actually came in less than his also included that repair and that i didnt think multiple contractors would have all missed the same thing
filled out form last night for quote
it was saturday morning
we are so glad we found express solar protection on yelp
he told me no were getting ready to close so i asked to talk to a manager and he told me my manager cant help you
the staff here are amazing
honestly they suck i live literally across the street and i go to the one on the 215 and rainbow cause they suck sooooo bad please get new personal bankers please i literally hate this bank
poor customer service
when i contacted them they apologized i paid the balance using my check book on the phone and i was out of collection
as the owner of vip jeff should have picked up the phone and talked with me about my concerns instead of being defensive and confrontational about his brother
cheaply made apartments shady leasing office loud hallways and thin walls small gym and pool not worth the money no parking even for people that live there leasing office doesnt care about tenants only about themselves
they decided to take down a bunch trees once the complex was under new management
i was able to get it fixed for 225
i cant say enough about todd or nevada realty solutions
however for the longest time the back pool was closed
unprofessional and deceptive company and a very bad experience
you cant ask for more right
i glad i used parker and sons
i am glad i found house spouse and allie
i thought my eyes had been playing tricks on me at first and had consoled myself with the fact i dont know what im doing and it was probably just my bad eyesight
we needed someone fast who could turn the pool around quick and make it sparkling for our new buyer
i will write to home depot in atlanta but im sure it will be filed in the round file with all the rest of these yelp reviews about barlow
rene was a great help on the phone
jeff and the drip system crew did a great job and spent a good deal of time with me explaining how to work the system and make any changes necessary
we cant call forward at all which we really need for when we are out of town etc
i appreciated their honesty on that
he then drove off without saying anything more to my mother
dan  his team are very helpful accommodating and do an amazing job at tinting for a very reasonable price  its pretty much a quick in n out
he never tries to upsell or over charge
we would recommend them to everyone
he is over to pick up payments so there is little effort needed on my end in the most painful part of the projectwriting checkslol
would definitely recommend
the guys are all very friendly personable and sincere
i called back and spoke to her supervisor who was no help
matthew cleaned out my very clogged up dryer vent and i am now good to go
some really young looking kid came out and hooked up the trailer to our truck
funny because they said oh its not even much only 075   300 depending on packaging size
he moved from az to or and just recently back again
friday morning right on time miguel flores and his crew came to my house
unsere neue wohnung haben wir mit sofa sideboard und esstisch von bo concept ausgestattet  sehr persnliche gute beratung und lieferungmontage genau dann wann wir es wollten
we have used other name brand paints and been disappointed in color fading and paint chipping and pealing even with meticulous prep work before priming and painting
i called them and not even an hour technician is already at my doorstep
have had every vehicle i owned tinted and did some myself so no there is art to doing a good job
the old acs were in terrible shape
the culture at the 211 is friendly community oriented and giving
a few months later the noise returns again someone comes by  looks around the attic for 1520 minutes
ive had charter for over a year and for the most part didnt have any major issues
like i said if you are looking for a dependable prompt and friendly companysunset gates is the best in the valley
i wouldnt recommend unless you plan on selling the house and pawning the future work on the next resident
thank you a million times over
its a pleasure to find a reputable company as there are some questionable companies around
like everyone says moving is no fun but haroom and angus were a big help and really relieved the stress of moving
i was so insulted i have never been treated like that
im still trying to recover from this experience
at 016 a pound the price absolutely cant be beat
if they dont know they will find you someone
my wife left notes on the door for weeks and received multiple calls from other of robs victims stopping by his store and reading our notes asking about our situation because they were in the same but with more money
lots of solicitations day and evenings
mike is a professionaleasy to get along
i checked the weld and rest of the work when i got home and its among the best i have seen
the tech arrived on time and was very professional and courteous
they want to charge me 45 to fix the cables that came loose due to strong wind because its in my backyard
for being a respected and well known company  such as lifesource i assumed they would use one of the large plumbing services
doesnt get much better than that
notified me 15 minutes prior to arriving and were finished my repairs within 30 minutes
no one wants to deal with mold but if you think you might have it call moldex
the apartment was nearly brand new with great appliances and amenities
i called in today to get our service reconnected and after speaking to a representative i asked to speak to a supervisor and she said no problem and put me on hold
brian was very courteous and professional and quickly located the problem which had to do with the time delay on the unit
as i was getting ready to clean my house with my normal service gena mentioned that they also clean homes
and then some which brings me to my next point
he replied can you please text me again tomorrow morning to remind me
i am disgusted at how many bugs get in my food and then they are bad now because roaches are filthy
they did some cheap renovations and rented it
im so glad i went ahead and had benocular clean my house i had offers from other cleaning companies but ben the owner actually does the work himself and is very diligent and punctual with affordable prices
i highly recommend james
the communication is easy
they will not communicate with a simple phone call
she sent us a website where we could view new houses that were in our requested area
his kids would jump off furniture and they had a dog that was constantly running running through the apartment
avoid this store check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town
it just got fixed a week ago
byop gave us the step by step breakdown of what steps came when along with what it should cost
dont be intimidated or put off by the looks
i have purchased their doors for another home years ago and loved the quality and the snug fit
overall im super happy with my new bedroom accent wall
since it was 20 years old
he was extremely flexible with our schedule due to bad weather and worked around his schedule to accommodate us
he basically told me to pound sand
i used to live in phoenix  and that place was trash
the service i received when i booked the move was great
now keep in mind i had the unit running before i took it to sears
no one answered my call and it went to a voicemail so i hung up
i doubt aubry even exists because 6 voicemails and 3 emailsno construction schedule
they are liars
the walls were paper thin
melissa was extremely rude
i strongly recommend that you consider this comapny in the  future
zac and his crew at pcm took care of my mortgage
he also was kind enough to call our home warranty and get authorization for the repairs so we could recoup the fees
i will definitely use his services again in the future
then the heating coil for the dryer was replaced but the washer was still broken
i came in here in a mad panic one afternoon after realising i had split a seam in my mums karen millen dresssht they could see i was in distress and were so lovely and comforting and had the dress fixed within the day

i felt and still feel so disrespected

she cries with you she laughs with you
i am very glad i chose this company
should have researched more before buying insurance through them with a new home
call dyer and not only did he know what it was but how to fix it and get the parts
their price is pretty reasonable too
i would give 6 stars if i could
no professionalism what so ever
only when i refused to accept that job and asked him to call his supervisor
i told them everything had to go even these few remaining things
they dont make it easy and credit unions should be leading the way here come on
we chose to stick with levin over the years because of the knowledgeable and friendly sales staff at this location
calling u pack
there are always plenty of employees around to help i was in there last week and i kid you not at least half a dozen people asked if they could help me
pablo also helped us select a replacement tree that is the ideal size and flower color for its location
after 1 month 30 days when scott came back to my house and saw the issues that i was complaining about he tried to tell me that my dogs had caused the issues and he tried to blame me for the discolorations and the cracks in the leather saying that i hadnt taken proper care of the leather
finally i called the company to cancel our service and just get our check
its pretty much on par for me
my father is a senior citizen and was left without movers
in every single possible way
the crew worked efficiently and everyone pitched in to help with the cleanup after

no apologies from either of them
i am moving out of state but will definitely recommend renco for major roof repairs or installation to you and to my friends
james at h2 pure did a fantastic job replacing our filters
the owner and foreman were always responsive
to me for an owner to return your call rather than the office staff to apologize and to go above and beyond any expectation to make the situation right says a lot about this company as a whole
if you must go to this location ask for one of these reps you will have a positive experience
i am sure they have done some good work just not to my expectations of quality workmenship
i have had a few experiences with different ones and they are always trying to up sell you and then they never properly fix what they came there for in the first place
in the before picture the tub looks wrecked
easy to book the appointment and the communication with the company was good
i would highly recommend him to anyoneeli is now my go to guy lol
my husband and i had patterson remodeling do a home remodeling project and were delighted with both the process and the end result
the space previously eq3 hasnt changed too much inside so its still a nice long store with plenty of walking room and ample space to check out the wares
i would hope anyone with half a brain would seriously read these reviews before they decide on where they are gonna live
whenever there was an issue he would blame simon the rude englishman and owner for any problems or breakdown in communication
not renewing my lease
i hate to ever need to call a plumber but when i do i appreciate knowing it only takes one call to fix my problem
i was able to walk on the carpet soon after
if you are looking for a vehicle wrap or window tinting look no further
there is no callback ever from i clean carpets which exactly deserves 1 star because 0 stars is not an option
we recently purchased a house from smokers so we had to have the entire interior of a 2700 sq
we originally planned on not getting a hotel room at all for our last trip to vegas
their site states that if i choose them to do the work they will apply my previous payment to what needs to be done
the piece is on campus so if you are driving there like we were there is a parking lot directly south of the piece
casey came to house on time
i am not interested in your apartment complex and i am not interested in being stood up yet again
we also use cycs sister company complete yard care to do bimonthly maintenance on our yard and they do an excellent job even fixing things or cleaning up messes without being asked
also moved a heavy dresser baby grand piano and elliptical trainerall expertly handled blanket wrapped and moved
only an amateur would put packing tape directly onto wood furniture and appliances
the only downside is it took a couple of weeks for them to become available to do the job
he painted three accent walls for my roommate  i  job was done exactly on time and very professionally
this may well be the best ac  company in vegas
what frustrates me is the parking situation a one bedroom apartment is given one parking spot in an underground garage
our garage door opener died on us yesterday
they worked within our budget and our new plug works great
he was able to get me in the same day removed some tint that was too dark for me and replaced it with some that was more to my liking
was told by one plumber gas water heater needed  to be replaced price around 3 grand
please steer clear of autumn creek apartments
the entire swap took less than 3 hours and they were quiet enough to let me get my beauty sleep while they were working
i would rather pay a little extra and get quality and guaranteed work done then call some hungover handy man and get shitty work done thats gonna need to be fixed in a year in my case less than a year
they will hold you to the agreement as they call it until you have paid every dime
call the front desk and they were nice enough to send someone looking for whoever is smoking but told us that the vent system is interconnected and smoke is going to get in our room
ac went out at the worst possible time 500 on a sunday afternoon during one of the hottest times of the summer so far companies are backed up for days due to extreme temperatures
i will be using them in the future if i need to
i called tricolor to ask about pricing for a basic key change on the front door lock of a house id recently bought
i also appreciated that besco took the mower in for repair with just my name and phone number
i am so upset i dont know what to do
moved in here december 2014 best move i could of done after searching and searching for the perfect place to live after numerous properties viewed we landed in here at the willows location is amazing our management is super awesome victoria and esther you will love them
i walked in and was greeted by wookie
according to the gardener the tree should have two to three times the space that is allotted to fill in
i left a message wthe business to please be punctual
thank you so much ron
we have now found a home through a different company and are very happy and excited
we told her we would not be moving in
i hadnt been in the store since college and it doesnt appear that much has changed
which is bs
at this point i dont know whos customer service is worst boa or cox
bottom line this place seems great and you might have fun living here but there are far too many negatives to outweigh the positives  especially with so many awesome new apartments nearby
this was a very awsome experience
my company used brewer for our business needs of plumbing and did a descent job
theres a community room by the gym that you can reserve which was quite nice
hi actually i just want someone to confirm their rate of 99 per hour thanks
i moved into avanti when it was still fairfield and i must say they are an amazing property management team
liars and cheats
the company charged a 150 fee for the two extra pickups however there was no room in the truck to handle the few pieces that needed to be moved from salem to lincoln city yet i was charged anyway for the salem stop anyway note salem is on the way to lincoln city and salem and lincoln city are approximately 1 hour apart however delivery to lincoln city did not occur until the following day april 23
i would recommend them to anyone
craig ross is the absolute worst
i wanted to upgrade my phone as well as soon as i heard about this deal but i am not an authorized account holder
rude people on the phone and waiting time for an appointment is 4 hours even if they say you are the first appointment you will not be and have to wait around
maintenance guy dont show up when requested
the service was great too
so time for the proposal everything was printed up and printed out
they are kind problem solving good sense of humor people
ill start by saying that i am a single mother taking care of everything by myself
my main reason for switching was to save money
this is for my vegas home
ron and his crew walked through and touched up any areas that needed it and made sure i was happy with the work before even asking for payment
my service was great
30 minutes on hold to order more watergreat way to treat a customer
neighbors had a fight at midnight outside my bedroom window
we both left feeling challenged relaxed strong and clear minded
i was impressed with service level when making the appointment
he followed up on everything and paid attention to details
if i could give this place zero stars i would
not helpful at all
when we called a second time we were told that we could get the slider track but they would first have to send out a technician for a lead test on the paint of the house
what a joke
there are three sinks and a fridge too
if a zero star rating were possible catherine would get that
i highly recommend this place
they were the only company that didnt call you day and night giving you another great price
that is until i ran into a member of the management team on july 4th and said i thought the office was closed today
im so grateful that i read the reviews for my ninja movers and went with them
the used to be good
my representative larry was difficult to get a hold of as well
so this year when it was time for our annual cleanup we call them again to come on out
he also said my insurance would reimburse me because they have a relationship with them i called my insurance company and no they do not cover this
the move in inspection was a nice touch and the few issues on movein were dealt with fast
the hd picture will pixelate and become chunky and move sporadically or freeze and the audio sounds like a robot stuck singing the note b flat
the one tiny critique is that the mail area is where the deliveries are made and its not a very secure area
i asked if he could come over on our next service day
the insulation layer in the attic also is very old and needs new insulation
i have spoken to many people and they say the same but our hands are tied when it comes to internet service
based on previous reviews from this site i tried to spend money with place of clay
i am an experienced mover moved almost yearly for the last 8 years and twice across the country but this was by far the best moving experience i have ever had
they obviously did not grade the pavers away from the house
i wish him the best since being an owner is not always easy but hes off to a good start
on day of inspection george walked me and my realtor through every single item on the house
bur hey guess what all of the information she had given us was wrong
i didnt want to leave him if i didnt have to
they do not respond when we followed up about the issues and provided pictures of the damages
the guys were extremely friendly and helpful
if youre looking for a headlight upgrade or for lights in general i would definitely consider this place
they assembled five pieces and everything looked perfect after they were finished they also completed it all before i expected them too which was great
the first day was prepping and priming and the second day was finishing
the windows in the formal living room were only cleaned to a point as far as one of the team could reach
rows and rows and rows of designs colors and different textures and they have a back section of clearance fabrics
we contacted emergency plumbing due to the yelp reviews
had priority scheduling which was an extra 30 set for 1pm they arrived 20 minutes early with no warning they was on the way so they sat an extra 30 minutes sitting around getting paid for nothing
maybe the reconstruction people should be contracting out to her  they wanted over 500 to verify the mold was gone but deborah did it for half that
they are a vey friendly staff

these people will terrify you into believing your valves will all blow
first their ad says 2 movers with truck for 49hr so that is what we booked

the staff is unbearably slow each time we come here
tom our salesman worked with us and our needs and let us demo the various units out right there on the property
i was later billed to replace the carpet
i was able to call or text him outside of normal business hours and he always responded

juan came out and completed the work in a timely manner
we were referred to him by our realtor randy hatada

they think of every detail and leave my house super fresh and clean every time they even vacuum my upholstered dining room chairs

the two woman who showed up were very thorough and professional

i misnamed carissa
i ordered 3 sections of american walnut butcher block counter from the peoria store in may
i still think they had a strong customer service team  great communication when they were active  but in retrospect and especially in comparison to the cleaning service i have been using in the meantime i wont return as a tidywhity client

if you arent trusting enough to just let corey tell you what to buy heather the friendly design consultant is a big help

the lady that answered said she would call us back in 1 hour to set up a time
the problem came when they went to reinstall my front door
he answered all our questions and took the time we needed to make the choices for making it our dream home

i will definitely use them again
our ac went out on saturday night i requested service through ahs and hoped i would get someone who was open 247 to come out and fix it that night or at least first thing in the morning it was 112 that day
spent hours on the phone with customer service who are refusing to honor the original price and claim the promotion never existed
the wifi sucks as well
towne square is overpriced and underhanded
our bathroom was sprayed with water at least three times
and when the service people do come they cant seem to get the system running correctly
fast easy honest reliable service from these guys
and finally he stated that both of the ceiling mounted air filters were dirty
really nice guy  good with my kids
i said that he is not a good representative of their company and has been unresponsive now twice
we are so happy with everything they did from start to finish
just for fun i called back and chose the upgrade service option and was magically connected to someone right away
this happened three times and my data charges went through the roof
would highly recommend over many others in the area
informed by the rep jackie that the long term commitment clause was in the monthly statement and since i didnt refuse it i was liable
if you are looking for great service at a fair price  look no further
sad to say the unethical practice of some companies is unfortunate
the first clerk didnt even know what a ro was the second one did and directed me to the one and only on the shelf
the rules are strictly enforced
been renting for a few years
the apartment is pet friendly breed restrictions but no size restriction
and when you show them their clerical error they act as if youre the one in the wrong

i requested the same crew every time for future biweely cleaning and they seem to respect my wishes about this

the staff is awesome as well
the peace of mind that we have from knowing our home is being protected while were away is worth every penny
they did an amazing job on the kitchen the rest of the house was just ok honestly no different than the other company i used before
ive asked them to put parking signs up for all events and theyre not even trying to do anything about the situation

he completed all the work in one day
we shut down the ac then turned it back on 25 minutes later and it was blowing cold air again
i think you guys should hire real movers that get it done not this 8 hour drama and breaking and losing things wo even apologizing
im sure everyone and their needs are different but i cant agree at all with the negatives here
stay away
vina the office manager sucks she has bad customer service and should be fired and never have a job
they even tried charging us extra money after we moved out for forced insurance even though we had insurance until the day after our lease was up on the contract
flat screen tvs

his laugh is infectious
overcharging charging for unnecessary services and use of intimidation tactics
either way the pool hours are 8am10pm

steve toley and alex we cant thank you enough
came over on schedule and put together my pool table quickly

shannon the owner is willing to contract with blatantly dishonest owners royce chow and gretchen is fully aware of every single issue discrepancy and false claim and agreed with me to my face that the actions of the owner were wrong yet she still chooses work for this company and passes along shannons decisions
they also clean grout and polish marble to its original state
glad to be out tho
the floors went in smoothly and looked great
the only plus was the technician who was very pleasant and polite

one hour stated that they would not come out until the next afternoon
our equipment is vacuuming the whole time during cleaning
for the other rooms i discovered blinds to go
the management i have to say has grown leaps and bounds from when i moved it
they always do great work at reasonable prices
he came to help without the expectation of payment hes just a great guy
they removed two of our nice pavers and replaced them with these cheap ones im not sure why
he was very polite and explained what he was doing thoroughly
they are aggressive
it clearly states in the contract that if anything happens from wear and tear they resolve it in 24 hours and that was exactly what happened
we hired proficient patio to install a patio cover artificial turf and a flagstone walkway
we have enjoyed living here and are only moving because we are purchasing a house
i highly recommend using them if you want honesty and quality hardwork
after contacting the company for a follow up we were told they could not specifically look for items since they could be in a number of places they might not have access to so they would just look over time as they move other peoples items
nobody told us this until move in day
we browsed the store for a good 30 minutes noting tile selections we were interested in
clearly the worst apartment in tempe with the worst management  if you are planning to move in here just run away without a second thoughtif you have already gotten into a lease god bless you apart from the regular issues like bed bugs roaches worst management etc they are big cheaters when i signed up for a 1 year lease they promised me a gift card worth 500 its been 12 months and my lease is already over and they are yet to get back to me on the gift card i met them multiple times mailed like a dozen times with no response whatsoeverkatie hall the manager asked me to provide document proofs for the promises they made during my lease agreement i am planning to settle this dispute in a small claims court if they failed to respond me in a week or two you can never expect integrity from the management  my final adviceif they promise you on any flashy freebies please make sure that you get the document proofs for the same  we are living in such a dishonest world where people dont hesitate to cheat each other 1 starmeh
she then proceeded to tell me i was denied for reasons she cant explain and she would love to override the errors and lease me a new unit but not refund me my money after i already leased an apartment elsewhere and was fully approved
my thought was always mehi guess it looks ok then id go through and clean up all of the missed things around the house
i was referred check maid by a friend and was very impressed with the job they did and their professional service

the bank wasnt even full its was in the morning when its usually empty
one week later the problem naturally perpetuated and began to occur again

we mostly worked with joshua selling agent steven buyers agent and andrew escrow guru who guided us through the home sellingbuying process
i hope this community realizes theres a lot of unhappy residents here and either get new staff or put their staff through training so they know exactly what they are doing

i will definitely use this team for my future buying and selling needs

i recommend  this company  hands down  the best in the valley

something else about this that nevada power is not in cooperation with vision solar or any other solar firm according to nevada power
from the first meeting we had with buckley he came across as a true professional with excellent knowledge about the real estate scenario  in the neighborhood we were interested in
he must have noticed the bin of shoes inside the front door and none on my feet so earnestly he asked if it would be better for him to remove his shoes
we have a bigger problem now as there is mold under the tiles
but the most surprising part was the reaction of the other shoppers while this man verbally abused me

the staff was amazing
my favorite local garden center and it is open year round

i will not recommend this company but i have no choice the home warranty refer me to the  the worst company in las vegas
ive renamed it wet repubic cause its just a bunch of drunkin stupid kids that are clueless
im happy to say that i was highly impressed by dodge electric and their expert services and fair prices

after my guests said the spin cycle sounded like an f16 in afterburner when it was running i called og and they sent out a technician who determined that it could not be repaired for the cost of a new washer

they have actually been downright rude to me on the phone and over email
hands down the worst customer service i have experienced in years
jeeze now paying 2400yr
corporate office refuses to do anything about your lost or stolen money then ignores your phone calls
i suppose this and other things are to catch people who they think may not pay rent

im from chicago so my standards are pretty high and this place exceeded them
they do it right or they dont do it at all

he screams and curses at his employees insulting them to the point of tears like nothing i have ever seen before
they ended up staying two and half hours and ms kim decided i have to pay like for 3 hours she keeps saying she told me but i am 100 sure about what she said over the phone
im very impressed with daves work
because of how large the showroom is it was very difficult to find someone to assist us

i called 3 total companies both were 5055 less than ace
the guy is an artist with plumbing
i love living here
my water bill was higher this month from what i am assuming is from a leak in the guest shower

do not call yes plumbing
i said then how are we at 34000 if i have 10 months left
then the installer put the handles on upside down
i have to go days at a time with out a phone because of verizons mistakes
i called dodge electric to come and give me a quote to add 3 new circuits to my breaker box as whoever wired my breakers prior to the purchase of my home didnt know what they were doing and was advised through my home warranty that they do not cover electrical failures due to overload and that this was what was needed to correct the problems i was experiencing
they provide incredible service
an order of this pillows has been placed to pacify me  ive only made the down payment on it and hope to have it in the new homestead soon
from drywall stucco to painting and cleaning services the ateam delivered on time the laborious and tedious  renovation
will definitely be a repeat customer
i honestly think my situation was just one of those sometimes things out of our control happen situations
we asked to get a quote on new carpeting in the entire house in addition to the laminate and they didnt try and push us to buy
please dont patronize me about clearing up my plan i know why it contains  second pedro pointed out extras before he even pronounced what the problem is
my friend has relayed that the owner told her never to contact his business again and hung up on her
i enjoy a duck pond just as much as the next person and obviously theres no stopping them as they are wild animals but my god those ducks are annoying

i lived there for a year 20142015  i lived in one of there studio apartments

they lost thousands for 60
i was like what the freakin hell
aaron  sanchez did an amazing job
the whole service experience was pleasant and the price was fair and reasonable
this crew is the way to go
or a plague of ebola
like soooo many other reviewers have said crap support total time wasting if you ever have an issue and even then no answers to help
the people who work here look and act like they hate the world and their job
this is a new review and im happy to say a 4 star review
so not happy here
the installation appointment process was horrific
the next morning another company came out and replaced the motor and was in and out in under an hour
the second day they painted
they say i am the rare 2 of the customer that goes over
it is really important to me that my house stays clean and tidy but i havent had time to stay on top of it
will be recommending to friends and family thank you
we had a great experience with justin time moving
starting with susan who is very kind polite and detailed phone is answered every time i called almost on the second ring
they were even able to make appropriate carpentry repairs before repainting the entire house
could not ask for better service
as good as it gets
kind of a lot for carpet cleaning i guess
im only giving this place a one star by default but they deserve no stars
just keep trying and eventually you will get through
eric is your go to guy for garage cabinets
it required very tight work in a small space
all in all thank you rpm management for your exceptional work
however this wasnt the case with dms plumbing
ohand i almost forgot
he is very personable and knows his stuff
i called to explain that my current lease wasnt up and that i did not need the unit before the first and had only agreed to take it early because she promised there would be no charge
in fact your wife raquel was the actual person who hired the company to try and evict me
it is great to see that and i will use
from minute one it was a terrible experience and a waste of time
we have done plenty of wine tastings at all sorts of places and at most pay 8 for normally 6 glasses of wine with good servings
you will love it
i was hoping to have a great time from all the rave reviews about great service and so
the place is well built and i rarely hear noise from my neighbors
before the fence surrounding it was closed off and made higher by neighboring high quality complexes the people at this place were a menace kids running wild and attempting to vandalize cars graffiti screaming and yelling fighting etc
his prices are extremely fair and he doesnt pressure you into anything
i will consider using them on some backyard landscape renovations in the future
they stayed extra hours tried several different techniques and over all took pride in their work
but guess what they are doing a major renovation to put in new roofs on every building
this company is truly passionate about trees and service
he sent me an written comprehensive estimate via email the same day
he is on time
when i called to complain i was told the notary was not responsible for the structure and wording of legal documents but simply to verify all parties in attendance of the signing are who they say they are
we are pleased with the results and glad angel talked us into the waterproof floors
all five locks to all the entrances and doors were changed as well as the mailbox in a little over an hour
are you kidding me
dan has provided impeccable service each visit and clearly is an expert at what he does
as a frequent visitor to the vertex apartments i went to the office to get a parking pass around 8pm
if you like to smoke this isnt the place
the pool sat there forever with the old plaster scrapped out and the new brown tile there
sls is right up the street
if you know kenneth already you know he is a die hard unc fan since he graduated from uncch kenan flagler
andrea is entirely the reason my aunt signed a lease without reservation and i hope this company recognizes what an asset her presence and energy are to their team
now i wont at all claim that parma the loveliest place to dwell in the cleveland area but it is safe and if you are going to live in parma this location is as good as it gets
im very surprised that i am the first person to review them given their popularity and that theyve been around for a while
jason have us several options for repair to meet our budget
child services could literally take children away from parents for housing as bad as what waypoint provided me when i moved in
pool is fantastic and the canyon bar pool resturant is also solid
rick listened to everything i said and helped me make the best decisions
its becoming something group therapy worthy
best moving experience ever
we had 7 locks around the house and kwikpick set us up with all of them rekeyed to 1 new set of keys to work all of the locks
only 2 called back
the layout for ours is odd some doors open into the bathroom vanity so you have to squeeze by or shut the door to get ready in the morning
maintenance is quick to respond
our customer representative was kim and she was very professional and thorough
night mike and his crew showed up early sunday morning to cut up it and dispose of it in no time
he offered to upgrade the piping to the water softener that would be a better quality
theres nothing left except for a couple of branches and leaves here and there
spend there 20 minutes and nothing
the staff in the office are very friendly always have answers to any questions i have
i will use them for all of my airconditioning and heating services
my appointment was 3 to 4 pm
if you want a spot get a garage
zachery can out today on time and did a great job
they are professional efficient and reasonable
people could not enter or leave in their vehicles without smearing apoxy all over for quite some time
the balcony looks over romare bearden and bbt ball park with city views that are beautiful
he was frugal but didnt mind spending more for something of quality
they tried and tried and she finally put them on the phone with us and we told them we would like to get several bids and we would be happy to look at their bid
laura and john in the front office are great
one word  yummy
this crook clearly wanted to scam me of my hard earned money
i would highly recommend using this company
i was having issues with my heater and they were here to fix it in matters of a couple hours
it seems to me that these guys are taking advantage of unsuspecting customers to pile on unnecessary overlyexpensive repairs and upgrades
great installationno worries
very personable and polite
very trustworthy  i cannot say enough
hes still trying to pull that
they were extremely clean neat and courteous
and he did get it working and saved me a bundle on a new door
they did an outstanding complete and quick job on all my carpet
i would recommend him to everyone who needs help with a lone to go see him you wont be disappointed
east valley was the preferred contractor for my insurance company however the experience with them has not gone well
thank you much
these people think there shit didnt stink
the apartment itself is not super fancy but the bathrooms were big for an apartment
a huge thank you to irene from avalon oaktree realty
laurine even said i could pay the extra 50 for the whole year if i wanted to
he even went the extra step and helped me move the heavy boxes in my garage that were in front of the water heater
i got three quotes
der metzger schneidet das fleisch super gut
extremely impressed with the level of professionalism and service these guys provided
high windows and a garage were the options
no reasonable lawyer would do this
it seemed like  no matter how i set up my delivery request the number of bottles i received didnt match my request
at the end of day 1 i realized they were painting two rooms upstairs with the downstairs color
he switched it out and had the system running within 15 minutes of pulling up to my house
told him i was just looking
the initial appointment was a breeze the options were all very clear and the quote was completely realistic
im a first time home buyer and she dedicated a lot of her time to show us around
actually this isnt even considered a dump thats too nice of a description
summary ordered a light paid a deposit waited 2 months no news found out ultra never ordered it for me
save your money
i appreciate that we are always kept informed about any news via email
they refused to do anything about it after that
four offers all running consecutively
arizona doesnt get very cold during the day but the nights can be chilly
the building had great amenities with a pool for each tower workout room racquetball court steam room and common room you could rent out with a movie theatre and pool table
these folks are great
i have called in several times but the problems persist
i found this guy on yelp and erik came out today to help with a big remodel that tied 4 different trades together and went way up and above 2nd sorry attic  to be precise to tie in some crucial electrical to make room for a telescoping patio door just in time for huge family easter party
we referred family who bought a house and then we were given the well in the fine print speech
please do yourself a favor and find your own subcontractor
i just had to download the app and sign in so i could leave this review
he said with crane and taxes
naturally an electrician was called out to fix the circuit
i would recommend him and the company 100 with no doubt
i would not advise using david radcliffe
well the oline site was having technical issues and suddenly the unit i was applying for disappeared
wade arrived on time after calling in advance to confirm much appreciated
three employees rude to other customer tonight who actually  became irate and upset at their deplorable treatment of her
desk clerksawesome room service staffawesome housekeeping staffawesome room servicerestaurant costsexpensive main floor staffhorrible
he asked me what he could do to make my feelings better towards him
ill tell right now my first experience with this company was in regards to a rental listing in gilbert
sierra air conditioning told me my air conditioner was under warranty so they would charge me only for the labor and they would have to send a technician to do a diagnosis 75
the tour guide was upbeat and seemed to love his job
after a disastrous experience with a greener life septic services referred by home advisor both of which i will never use again i was reluctant to call anybody
i highly recommend you do the same
my mother died early this year
our replacement unit was delayed at least a day by rogers inaction

the packers were amazing and nothing was broken
oh i try to book golf round at las vegas country club i called the hotel frontdesk n hotel concierge many times no one seems to know i called like from 8 am to after noon finally someone direct me to vip lounge and the gal helped me out
first and foremost the only thing nice about the lennox is the office and maintenance staff and thats it
on 2 big jobs
i couldnt be more pleased with his work
i once mentioned that hes the only service person that knows the ins and outs of our house
when i received the quote it clearly showed everything broken down with a description and i felt her prices were fair
i think it is funny that people will only take time to post negative reviews
he came out and opened the car first so we could see if they were locked inside
professional and fast
both times we have had them service our ac units we have had awesome results
on top of calling me a liar he claimed that he was a military man and knew how to pack things up quickly
it doesnt appear ahs contracts their services with low bid contractors
i asked kendra one of the office staff if i had to keep the utilities on and she told me no and they would have them turned on in the companies name
my air conditioner stopped working probably three times the dishwasher was falling out of place the garbage disposal stopped working and once flooded underneath my sink causing all sorts of old food and liquids to flood almost the whole kitchen
in anticipation of a garden wedding in march we decided to update our three patios a walkway a pad holding the garbage cans and a back door entry pad
used these folks today for the 1st time today
this is a complete and unnecessary monthly cost
he is one of those small business owners that reminds you why going with local pros is such a pleasure
cleaners show up at 10a  pleasant professional and get right to work
i was going to install the laminate myself
its simply a great place to explore a refined selection of professional quality chefs knives  which is clearly their passion
but the postorder process meaning after theyve collected payment is one of the worstmost time wasting experiences i ever had
look  i called 3 moving companies for my move to pa  mayflower never called me back
thank you scott
a couple did not answer but when i called top notch i got through
maria and i walked thru all their amazing inventory of slabs and we selected one that went perfectly with our cabinets and flooring
next to all the horror stories ive heard about american west i feel so much better about buying from richmond american
which is amazing in this arizona heat
i give them my highest recommendation if you need new trees
the management the staff the apartments were wonderful
the 1st set of 6 chairs that arrived 7 months ago had defects such as soiling scratches or inconsistent stitching and filling
one contractor came in with a bid twice as much as east valley disaster on another job we sent them
to start the sales guy knew what he was talking about and all seemed good however once the paperwork started the awkwardness came out
but i will not ever be using this service again update 0528  the day after my review was posted david called to fix my issues
the kitchen photo is the same as our units exactly
gate entrance always breaks down which leaves room for solicitators or would be thiefs to stroll on in into the community
price very reasonable for an emergent weekend call
can you give negative stars
they assigned it to reliable glass
i have moved extensively and have never worked with a company that was more flexible professional careful and customer service focused
they wanted to do the walk through without us however i insisted that my fatherinlaw be present since it was after our move out date and i didnt trust them to give an accurate move out quote
not sure how long the security deposit will be returned but the estimate he gave was in about a month
there is a major difference in quality between their lower and better paint
a lot of talk and no action when it came down to getting things done
baseline mechanical is the only one that responded
i took the final exam and math review took some classes over and the 6hour contract class assuming i would pass after about 115 hours of class time and countless hours of selfstudy
shady shady company
i also called the the home warranty company and told them they should not have companies working for them that throws them under the bus like he did several times
all our traffic areas look like new now and luckily all pet stains are gone
i guess this store has real service issues
excellent products pricing and professional installation by a really great guy
i searched yelp and saw a lot of reviews from friends who went here before so i decided to send a message to this business
another terrible experience
we will definitely call david again
my dog was constantly getting some kind of stomach bug
all because idiots that work there have no idea what they are doing
thank goodness they were able to fix my dryer and the best part was that they were so affordable
good location down the road from chandler mall and the freeways
thanks a lot rene jeff and your roofing crew
i would challenge anyone to find another building at this price point with soundproof walls
i feel as though i am now constantly being harassed with fines and letters to move out because the woman underneath and crystal klein are in the office discussing my lease information and are seeming to plot against me
im counting the days til my lease is up
unless you want to be treated like a prisoner to their immature staff
on occasion accidents happen where damage can occur to a customers home
i say lets go ahead and turn service back on i dont want the buyers to back out of the deal
save yourself the aggregation and go somewhere else
they were very professional
responsible and honest
would definitely come back here
ive had several cases where carpet in a rental was so soiled i thought replacing it was probably the only option
we decided that it was not something i needed worked on at this point
off your own negligence
his voicemail box is full by the way
it is clean and decorated nicely
will never use this company ever again
thank goodness i have a friend living in the same apartment complex just 2 buildings down from me and we were able to leave the piano there as she was out of the country at the time
i play with the usual stuff to no avail
the tip he asked for was ridiculously big
i hired jtb very last minuet to do a quick clean up job on my backyard yard which was pretty overgrown
so the day ends and lo and behold as they are charging the system they find a hole in the coil that the manufacturer had inadvertently created
all residence here should have been better accommodated
after inquiring with 10 pool companies dan provided the best price on a new cartridge filter
i lucked out and met andre and within 15 minutes he had removed the adapter from my pc with little effort and  no charge
they cleaned over 3000 square feet of commercial space which had a multitude of spills and stains from our employees
so far i love living here and feel very safe
now if you want to arrange anything else requiring the most basic of skills  communication skills such as requesting that they send over someone to look at our greenish water  quickly tell us what to do in order to to fix it this is not the company for you
the next day he began walking around the parking lot wrecklessly handleing an unholstered od green springfield xd9mm
him and his two employees did a quality job on the house
they were able to complete the job a day earlier than originally anticipated they did a superb job on the application and the job site was so clean you wouldnt know they had been there
was able to get an appointment quickly
i would not recommend this agency to anyone for anything
i say that because the hotter it is the more water and chemicals you have to add to a pool
natasha understands the business but more importantly she understands the people business behind this industry
i love that pure plumbing is honest
jackie has made snide comments to my husband congrats on your lennar home
i am very wowed by rogoz electric
not at all what we were told
austin then asked if he could send another of his team out to inspect the work done at our business and make any repairs necessary
christy took my call and scheduled a tech to come to my home the same day
i have seen rats and mice at the pool
plus the staff actually cares about not only their clientsthe prop owners but also the tenantsthey made sure my house was perfect before moving in
it is so peaceful pet friendly and beautiful
ive lived here for 2 years now and i used to hate this place there were cockroaches in the kitchen and the management had bad attitude every time i requested something
its customer service people like garrett that make us stay loyal
we shopped around with several vendors that were highly rated on homestars but settled on night and day because their pricing was competitive but their service and expertise was far better than others
the response was quick
every other time ive moved the moving crew cleaned up after themselves including taking the trash
they did a great job
she even left before we were through our tasting and didnt tell us or the next serverugh
you cant go wrong with citywide
he was very pleasant with her answering all her questions and showing her how to operate it
also it only took a week and a half for them to refund me my deposit
ehg my head hurts just thinking about how messed up this company can be to a person
im seeking a new server for them
called this company after reading a few positive reviews on google
im always covered
dont expect them to know what theyre talking about and go prepared
we also gave away of a few large furniture items which they decided to take but they refused to handle it until they were off my clock
one chair fell apart
afterwards we got a free tasting of the port which was delicious
nobody got with us
i couldnt be any happier
i asked a few quotes before we chose color pride so we did our research
i took one star away due to the fact that i asked for them to get back to me regarding a picket fence for the front yard and never heard anything
but very poor internet quality
it was so much more affordable than i thought it would cost
i will use them in the future and would recommend them without hesitation
i love his attention to achieving the perfect lighting
she stayed with her for 55 hours and the charge was 257 plus 15 booking fee
i was very impressed with rob and the work her did
mike was amazing and his crew treated us like we were family
we scheduled a meeting and ageed on a price on the first call
what else can i do
she always calls to confirm provides periodic updates
their response i can submit an escalation and you will hear back from someone in 23 days
i used fishs rentals for a one way move and the gentleman who helped me jason was excellent
so i went into the moving experience apprehensive about items being lost or damaged
joshua hill is the consummate professional
there must be state agency that i can file a complaint with
i definitely recommend him and will use him again
they made excuses saying it was the type of tintetc
when i got in there were 1020 roaches crawling in my kitchen sink and the floors and carpet were filthy
we have recommended larry to many of our clients and have never heard a negative comment from any of them
after reviewing the carpet condition the very professional tech calls to tell me the out the door price was 240
at the signing i knew everything the title company was going over and having me sign because of everything brent taught me
they did such a great job that i had to bring my brother in to get his car tinted
the technician justin called when he was on the way and was right on time at 3pm in an unmarked 90s white minivan
we had the mussels in this delicious cream sauce that we wanted to lick from the bowel
he promptly answered my call told me to send him a picture of the projects i needed complete quickly texted me back and we set up the appointment i couldnt believe i got this lucky on a holiday
we were all woken up to one of the guests screaming out of horror
the community is quaint well kept has great amenities and is spacious
and the place is pet friendly with doggie treats at the front desk and dog waste bags at the front door
the 2 guys were clean a tidy
the tech was to be here at 8am and still no showed
he made me feel important and talked me through every step
the grout and 11yearold carpet both look wonderful
note that my review was removed by yelp  as this business appears under multiple sites
despite doing so much heavy lifting you will be surprised at how calm he sounds when he speaks to you either in person or even just over the phone
i was super impressed over other cleaning companies that i have used in the past
had to file police report on him
a disgruntled homeowner
i dont know where to even start the main reason i chose to live at the retreat was because it seemed secure
i trust him and i trust that hes doing whats in my best interest at all times
i made an appointment 3 days ago to have my ac looked at
they were prompt efficient and meticulous from start to finish
carpet and tile look brand new every time cr surface cleans them
michael came out the next day and took a look he felt that something was off with the programing so he reset everything and redid the remotes
gigi has been an awesome help getting me set up with my new apartment
the service techs were there to help us figure out the new tstats they installed and were there to answer any questions we had
im not promising that they can do the same but the fact that they were able to come through for me was awesome
thank you james and staff for a great two years here
the gentleman i had used for years had to finally retire
if i could have given no starts i would
with so many realtors in the valley  its important to pick the right realtor
4 guys showed up ready to work and 8 hours later everything was in my new house
finally az spa tech delivered on all promises and did so at a fair price
carlos and his crew was very attentive to details and they were careful with our plants around the house
everyone was very patient and extremely helpful
it seems like the owner is a great guy and cares about his customers and his business
the verizon stores in california are terrible and i grew up in california
chad even sent me pictures after all the work was done so i could see what the place looked like
every plant ive purchased at the bosque and pueblo the sister store has been very healthy and has thrived from the start without needing the necessary help from me
so do emails
i highly recommend ryan and 1st call garage doors and will contact them for any future garage needs
going forward i wont call anyone else for my plumbing needs
it gave us confidence in the company on that long trek south
booked a date and time
we finally received a call from the technician around 710pm
they had great customer service communicated well before the move as well as through the whole process
wonderful customer service
bonus if you want to wander they have everything you never new you needed and more
dont rent here its a shit show
called on a monday they were able to make an appointment on wednesday at a time convenient for me
there are a couple different  bars and restaurants as well as a mandatory starbucks  if you want to go gambling there is a walkway that connects the towers to the mgm
our pool has always been kept nice and clean
price was competitive with other movers
will definitely use kelso from now on for all our heating and cooling maintenance
they did a great job
have never seen any drug deals going on or police with their guns drawn
i already paid for the other parts i had to buy and had to pay the installer an extra hour of time
this is the place for you
when we told them they were in shock at how delicious everything was
highly experienced bobcat operator fast and efficient and his quote was very reasonable
his hourly rate is 60hour
the owner john did the estimate himself always a good sign
if you have perfect credit no criminal background and great rental history you should have no problem
his next trip was to make the first repair patching the leak which failed  the pipe was still leaking
best service ever
i will never recommend franklin west to any of my friends at least despite of the fact that their properties are well maintained
a conservatory grand and a suzuki digital
second they were at my home within 2 days of the call to give me a full estimate
one of their staffers even pleaded jokingly to let him help me since he was bored out of his mind
additionally would have gotten nowhere with best buy when i had the technical problem
after a few reports of garage doors not working at some of our east valley properties we decided to hire a local expert to make the necessary repairs
not a very smart move for them
the man spent about 10 minutes on the phone with me giving me plenty of information
again the increase in fees was not communicated prior to this delivery by the notary
there were several other lies involved and when i told him he said he would do it for 250
i was told it would take an hour and they took my cell phone number and promised to call when ready
this company and every single employee that ive dealt with over the last 4 years has zero concern with doing anything for the homeowners even as far as answering questions
do not shop here   ive went thru them twice and never again
lamar our guide was very good at explaining when they guys do and even had some history on the stuff on display
live and learn
plus i loved this place when i lived there
they were quick very clean and were very knowledgeable
the guys that run dig it made it easy to purchase the 5 little plants we purchased
five stars customer service and accessibility has been priceless
i am very happy with the way my car looks and the temperature inside is way cooler
six of my family members also use them
we also ordered an all new filtration system expressly stating that we wanted everything new
i see people always digging in the trash trying to find stuff in there
cox is like oops my bad
never using them again
so labor which was 20 min transportation and equipment upkeep for john the service person who came was 171
karen did an amazing job
great job guys
i replied wow thats expensive you didnt even do an actual leak detection
we highly recommend this cleaning company to you for business or residential
i got to watch a pizza man sit in his car across from me for 30 minutes just to deliver a pizza
they have also a selection of cushions from india
they are honest and the quality of work exceptional
i broke my garage door because i backed up into it by accident
3 prices go up once they get you in so you end up paying more than other places that do charge a deposit
bbqs are a mess and with only 2 for an entire community theyre already super dirty
so i dropped my iphone and cracked the screen
in the mean time i had 3 professional roofers to inspect and determine the issues
they moved our very heavy furniture and did a nice job with some very good carpet
not sure what everyone else is complaining about but we worked with william tara and ashley and it was a pleasant experience
she was in tears when i found out about the conversation she had with him
done deal for ll
they kept asking if they were done  was it time to go
they kept directing me to a phone i didnt want
they have asked that i call security so they can come into my apt regardless of the hour hear the noise and then address the issue with the neighbor
damon and arrow property management are a ripoff
they are outstanding at cleaning carpet tile and furniture as well as removing pet odors and urine stains
i contacted bbb
i highly recommend hays cooling  heating
when i returned the truck later in the day the attendant refused to believe the mistake could have possibly been on their end and charged me an extra fee for the use of the dolly which i did not use
one full week with no air 2 dead hamsters greeted us upon our vacation return
i was given two windows of time to choose from
no one has answers no one calls you back and no one shows when they are supposed to
i was calling this wednesday because i had service done in june
we set up an appointment time to have a consultation and needless to say eduardo never showed up and never called
hoping for the same treatment on the next visit
chip off the old block was absolutely fantastic fantastic fantastic
i think it could be considered fraud or bait and switch they have also failed at providing me with better service than cox
i used portland student movers for a move last year and am using them again this week
i do not recommend this company at all
i needed help painting the trim of my house in north las vegas
they knew what they were doing
seems to me this company was trying to pull a fast one on me and drain my wallet
jpg was referred to us from a friend
very thorough top notch service
i was greeted within 2 seconds of walking in thank you for the great service
its quite a hike to the mgm
that day and the following day we left all windows open and fans on
the wall of the shower was explained to us as refinished but they just threw paint on the wall and all in the bathtub which now is slowly coming off due to taking showers
keep it up folks
save yourself a lot if headache and give your money to those who deserve it
the guest bathroom is spacious
im not even bothering and went ahead to request a refund
ive contacted them at least 45 times since i moved in to fix my sliding door screen because it constantly falls off and yet they tell me they fix it but every single time not even an hour or two later  i go walk outside and the damn screen falls off seriously
from the time i contacted him to the installation was just over one week delay was only because of our comparing he probably could have done sooner
bonus 2 miles from the strip
the rib joints all had their nasty sticky old trophies on display like anyone is not using them to spit gristle into
so i go home to change and go to the office to file a complaint
this is our first year buying a live christmas tree as a family and we were really looking forward to the experience
ive been waiting here for about an hour alreadythere tech dont know what there even doingthere slownot fit for the jobi been waiting here for a long time that i had time to make a stupid account to rate this cox customer ratei would not recommend this place to no onethe service is good but not the techs here are really bad at there jobcustomer are walking in and out the doorthey have only four techs workingthey either then to hirer more employees or get employees that know the job
maybe if you had routine maintenance done on the pipes you wouldnt need to inconvenience your tenants
this property is now a timeshare property
very animal friendly and they allow me to bring my dog into the office when i need to pay rent etc
from the front courtyards it looks decent because they just repainted and keep the gardens wellmaintained but thats about it
thanks to the dukes of air yes that is their real name check them out on yelp
the community seems to be kept up and maintained nicely
they shouldnt have dumped my things in the garage
if i could give them less i would but 1 is the lowest and trust me these company is much lower than the lowest
i hope they shut down
tom is awesome
he provided guidance throughout the whole process
i have been with cox for almost 3 years now and i am do blown away that this is happening
i highly recommend chameleon painting and i would most definitely use them in the future
now if they would rape my wallet i would be a happy camper
4 the building is basically full of college students expect to have loud music and party noises during weekend
i am pleased to say after getting  many new roof quotes i am very happy that i chose one roofing  company
minus the bugs i liked the apartment and the management was very responsive
dont put yourself or your personal property at risk
i ask a lot of questions so he educated me on some new things along the way as well
i have been working with these guys about 5 years now and 2 days ago my ac went out
found out things that were dangerous in my 60 year old home
a salesman called me approximately three times over the following week to try and get me to buy a new system or get the coil replaced even after i told them to stop calling and that i would call them if i was interested
i am a big fan of lowes and find the sales staff to be very friendly and helpful
he went to ask the manager to talk to me then came back and said the manager was not there after i saw them talking to each other
room service was quite exceptional
over the years i utilized there services multiple times
of course i was on autopay and if centurylink can get their grubby little hands on your money thats exactly what they do
they also checked the unit and found a small hole in the heating unit that would eventually expand and allow carbon dioxide into the home
and they are terrified of dogs
my favorite thing about this store is that they support the do it yourselfers
i told him we had measured the space and it would and he said in a snotty way well did you measure the space by the counters
take the gym as another example
the installers broke the concrete door step installing the front door we had to patch and repaint the concrete and cracked the frame
scott and his crew were at our house when they said they would be
the techs were true pros and speaking to george i was given some maintenance tips
they are fraud scam artist low life  modern day thieves
when the job was done he handed me the bill
brad returned our call within 30 minutes and billy was at our location within a few hours and had us back up and going in no time
scott who did our kitchen knocked it out of the park and i couldnt be more pleased
i have used tlc flooring twice now
responded fast to a yard i  had no time to take care of and was not looking very good
very responsive team with all our questions
matt came into my home said it didnt look that bad then insisted on the deeper cleaning
ive used these guys several times for both home and work and theyre great
i highly recommend him
basically paying for your detail
let me tell you about my experience with auston woods
dan was great to work with
my wife and i were looking for a retractable screen door for the backdoor
i wanted a low maintenance simple looking back yard
and did an amazing job
we called him friday night at 830pm and he was ready to drive all the way to our house to help  but we told him that we would be fine for one night without ac
apparently rob usually does the carpets himself but due to mechanical issues with his van he had to send one of his guys alex to do the job which was fine
the gym adds a nice touch as not many people are in there at a time and i am able to get a full workout in
strangely enough it had not been checked during my tuneup by another company back in march
i asked if she had gotten our email with the tenant contact info
so i wanted to give some positive feedback so others would give them a try
although he had a part to make it work he wanted to install the factory match part
he immediately diagnosed the evaporator coil to be the problem as it had a noticeable leak
leslieville geek came to our place of business and established a network for us in windows and mac at a very reasonable price
we got estimates from quite a few companies but lightning pool solutions was the only one that followed up and matched a competitors price
i tested my phone to ensure that its working sure it does
growing up i often tagged along with my dad as he worked as a realtor and later on as a salesperson for a large new home builder and for over five years i worked as a parttime sales assistant for this same company
were answered from the beginning to the end
safe yourself the agony and use a different provider if you can
aqua doc was great
we struggled with a couple of other window washing companies that never showed up or never called us back
i always want to like this place but i just cant
i called later that week and allowed them to reschedule for the following monday
our finished kitchen is beautiful
mike and his crew are very responsive efficient and did a terrific job on my roof
as it turned out the septic tank had not been cleaned in about a decade and no one even knew where it was
a very wellmanaged apartment complex
since the weather will be cooling soon he said he could install the freon which is expensive or wait until the springtime and have them check it again
so we took them up on the 200 off next months rent
i originally contracted them to tile bedrooms in my home
put a telephone number on your website and answer peoples questions
she also informed me that the demo of the tile backsplash would damage the drywall and they do not repair drywall
not to mention i had an untypical motor they were still able to get arrived when they said they would call me in the evening to let me know they got my motor and again arrived on schedule the next day and completed the job
my mother rented a home that ms crosta was managing for 3 years 4 months
anthony and the steve owner of elite came out on time and called with and eta
rating this place a bit late but was quite nice to live at alanza place
disappointing as the movers we had were good but the contact person is disorganized and somehow snuck in a third person and charged me for it when that wasnt agreed upon in our emails
i just happened upon cosimos store and am so grateful i did
she seems wellliked by the ladies who work with her and they work very well together as a result
he told me up front how much a service call would cost and it sounded very reasonable
shes friendly because she talks to you as if she has known you and comes across as really wanting to do what you want
very reasonable prices
even the people who live here are nice
we would definitely hire again
i feel very fortunate to have taken the plunge with third federal despite my initial skepticism at the too good to be true terms that they offer
this place is the worst shit everrr
one went down another was weakening and the third was teetering
one nice thing is they have huge patios
they show up on time cover the house inside outside top to bottom
i was looking to purchase a sofa
she is a great realtor and we would very much recommend her services
chris najarro was exceptional to work with
its not safe and its horrible
bought a house and called to cancel three months later
talk about living in hell
most places say between 10am and 5pm which is kind of ridiculous
rudy knows that time is money and i had 2 different project for him to work and he worked on them both at the same time
although we were comfortably stuffed i noticed masala chai brle on the specials board
i would recommend this to anyone that hasnt gotten an inspection or needs any repairs on their air conditioner
one of my heater blowers there are two units on my house wasnt kicking on
we had a wonderful experience with the brel team
the technicians are incompetent the customer service representatives are rude and their vip service is a scam
the apartments are diverse in their design as are the tenets
i have not yet seen this refund
highly recommend this service
we have had people picking through garbage at 2 am waking people up
the smell came up through holes in the floor my apt was the entire first floor
careful and efficient
felt very slummy and poor
oh and i rarely ever write negative reviews about any business but this one is well deserved
i dont have roaches but ive been in other buildings in the complex that were infested
these guys are the best at what they do and they wont disappoint you
i still have mail forwarding at that address so in theory it should have just been forwarded to me
he went the extra mile when most carpet guys wont even bother
nowhere will let you sign a contract 60 days early so i cannot fathom why they need the extra 30 days notice besides it is a scam that they know many people will overlook
i sent pictures to tomas the builder and asked him what could be done
super happy with our experience
first off i absolutely hate walking in to the stores because the sales people fucking pester and annoy the shit out of you every fucking chance they get
the new door looks great
within walking distance from all the major hotels and office buildings downtown phoenix
they obviously love their job and love satisfying the customer
we only want to use licensed professionals and we are willing to pay for excellent quality
it was a big deal to just get them to replace the lights in the parking spaces
stop calling stop emailing
teresa  moses are nononsense business owners who actually care about their customers
dukes just saved me s6000
one nice manager finally gave us a diff room but it was worse than the first
i checked into prices offered by the big stores lowes and home depot
shaffer  sons were the company our home warranty servicer sent to help us with our hvac problem
thanks to everyone at lubber liquidators and ro flooring for great customer service and installation
i would not look any further than clear water concepts as someone who has purchased a system from them from 5 states away this is as good as it gets
they are prompt friendly honest helpful neat  tidy
there are other cheaper and more reliable alternatives
i enjoyed reading the occasional snarky notes posted from management in the elevator threatening to evict residents for throwing cigarette butts off of the balconies
handcrafted car audio is outstanding
the checkins are laughably slow
techniciansrepairmen are salaried
i will definitely  be using ace home services again and will be referring them to friends and family
multiple phone calls
there are plenty of other complexes in the area and if our rent renewal didnt coincide so closely with our wedding we would be looking for another home
after they left i went to sit on my bed and it fell apart
we kept having to call and check on it toothey never called us first
he worked for about an hour and a half making sure the problem was fixed and explained everything as he did it
open until 2pm on saturday  las vegas weekend gambling savior
after making an appointment with the tenant mike ricker the owner personally went to the home and took a comprehensive video of the entire bid walk
these are definitely my goto guys from now on
i am so very happy i found him and his crew
i contacted this company on the recommendation from a friend
i would definitely use their services again and refer them to friends and family
yes we have asked for such services and they are not providedagain the reason for this review
he got the door open and made extra keys
he said he would email us the quote to fix what he could
cons people use the lot to abandon cars walls are thin my upstairs neighbor is what drove me out
im from boston and ive always kept my door locked even if im walking five feet away and ive never had a problem if that gives you an idea
this place is overpriced on a main road with super thin walls
we spent 2900 here for four nights had room service ate at edge steakhouse a few times two times at cafe etc
they took time to continue to follow up after even though they made no money off of us and did everything they could to make certain all of our concerns were addressed
so we worked out a deal we agreed on for the 3 options plus the higher end paint
he rectified the problem and started to clean the filters out by dumping all the leaves and debris in the rocks at times even dumping the debris right on top of the hedges
two years ago the leak in my basement reached a point that was unbearable
the list of complaints is simply too long to itemize
i dont normally write reviews but for this i have to
did a great job was fast supper happy with the work
my cabinets were a maple color and i had them refinished to extra white
the standard bell 1 star
youd be wise to use them
this is literally the worst home improvement store i have ever been to
these guys know what theyre doing
it all worked out and the carpets throughout the house look great
rob also cleaned the carpet and every possible stain was removed
truly as good as it gets for this situation
this company is the worst to deal with
that guy was awesome
looking for an electrician
the ownersalesman is unfortunately someone that will lie to your face
made this easier than i ever imagined it to be thank you so much allison
they are very nice and will respond immediately to any pool crisis
house of tricks is the most romantic restaurant in tempe
i have had an issue with ants in the apt however i hear thats an issue all over vegas
this was the first time we have ever hired a moving company and i was skeptical about spending the money
there are places which are much more aesthetically pleasing and offer better prices
i urge you to ignore the fake reviews that this company has posted or asked others to post for them
theyve literally done nothing to solve the problems for the past 7 years
im glad i finally have a guy
josh and oliver along with the rest of their team are the best
maybe next time
i called him back the next morning and he brought a larger piece of equipment and completely cleared the drain this time
i called and spoke with carmon earlier today about relocking all the locks in my house
after i had the solar unit ordered and installed i didnt hear from them for 2 years
i inhereted a house with these miserable windows
the people in that office are horrible and rude
i wont go to the big box stores anymore because the scarce employees are useless and no one ever knows anything unless its their department
just this last week keith came over right away to replace a broken compressor
we discussed a date but a slot opened up earlier and i took it
nothing but issues and my door isnt even installed yet
couldnt access their website
he helped us get qualified for our first home and he did an awesome job
the best part is we have a friend who was looking for a mover and wanted to know what we thought of bulwark
so then i go to the local store to turn in my cable boxes and the girl on the phone canceled the cancel order
beautiful selections check out the new leathering process for granite
they came to my house with samples and we set up an installation
fernando tackled a bit of an unusual exterior painting project on our home
the two gentleman luis and jordan were fabulous and did everything they could to ensure no scratches or that they could get all our items down three flights of stairs
two techs showed up on time and the crane was right behind them
they were supposed to have come this last friday although we did not see them we have cameras and the baskets were full of debris on saturday
he did a fantastic job at a reasonable price
that stands to reason that the administration should then perform some valuable task
after a long runaround of them leaving me on hold for over 10 minutes and then telling me jennifer wasnt there but then when i hung up and called back somehow jennifer was suddenly on the phone
then the second time he came he started to fix something else not even knowing he was here for the ac its ridiculous
chance was amazing
i had high hopes at first
when we got to the distribution center and began unpacking into the moving truck several of our items were broken and the boxes had been tossed around
they would of waited if i was not available for the earlier time
he was courteous quick and professional
maybe she doesnt have the patience to deal with newbie customers who have issues or questions
i spent two days tryn to clean my two car driveway with store bought degreaser i just made the stains bigger
they were great
we bought our house a year ago and knew we had a nice ac unit but i wanted to get it checked out before it gets hot this year
i dont think it takes 3 people 2 hours to clean a bathroom
the signature is amazing
another bad review for this horrific company
even my bathrooms are immaculate what takes me forever to clean are the soap scum and water mark stains
it took a half hour before the sales person who i know really wanted to help but he was fighting against apathetic coworkers found a way to go find what i wanted and bring it out to the sales floor
so he was obviously choosing to ignore my calls
the problem then started
as for the installation everything is running well and they did do a great job so ill give them a 5 star for that
you are real thank you for that
chef nicole is helping me get to my desired weight and so fast too
and once again wed like to extend a heartfelt thank you to dan
it was loose leaves and dog poop
i thank you and really appreciate the courtesy and helpfulness from you guys
i did some searching and settled on silver eagle
within a day he was able to collect materials and create a beautiful shelving unit in my bathroom adding a rustic touch of beauty to it
he appeared friendly and honest
safeguard was recommended to me so i first reached out to them by phone
their scheduling was extremely flexible the techs were friendly and they know the products extremely well
i just called in again and they are more willing to cancel my service with a 240 cancellation fee than to make my bill affordable
needed them for a last second clean for mothers day weekend and they were able to bail me out
although maintenance was quick to come and fix things when they broke we had bad feelings about some of the maintenance guys
you got a spot assigned to you and you paid for it but there was no enforcement of that
i was met by a courteous professional within the hour and he had the lock broken in minutes
luckily for our next investment property we found another company that did exceptional work and can manage to talk on the phone politely
they were able to come same day but i wasnt able to be there when they arrived so scheduled for the next day early morning
call him for any of your plumbing needs you wont be disappointed
im very grateful for the other reviewers who helped me find this company
they were excellent
i expect the prices to be higher in a verizon corporate store than costco best buy etc which they are
this is my first review of anyone and only because this company deserves the recognition
the trash room is horrendous
look forward to the changes that both property and business manager are making in the community overall
same day and met my deadline
they have a small gym nice pool jacuzzi with mini cabanas
he produced a very comprehensive report with pictures of my place and took the time to explain everything to me in great detail which i really appreciated
i would use callus plumbing now regardless if it was something that wasnt covered under our warranty
i highly recommended
which is no surprise since most of us are working professionals
they really want to make sure your satisfied with the outcome and i am
i suggest they either hire more sales people or put in place a better system that tracks your potential clients calls
these guys are nice and polite but overall the experience has been rather unpleasant considering the amount of time its taken
fast same day service
their branch is located at 10000 w charleston blvd 180 las vegas nv 89135 phone 7022548286 if i could i would give them a much higher score than five stars
just having the pool closed for a long time during the summer and upgrading the gate took a while
i moved my 82 year old mother in with me
see what kaila k wrote
lenny saved our backyard from a disaster
cant beat that
if i could break my lease without penalty i would
the select transport owner had not told me there was another missing hose connection which he had removed
i swear some people just live to complain
he showed up right on time and gave my system a quick once over and discussed with me my options
if in 30 days of moving into my house the flooring started to chip on the edges and was not a very good floor at all
all the work was completed in one day except for the shade screens that came a week later
they were very honest and knowledgeable
next year we will have work done on our bathrooms and we will be contacting amos for that work
we hired el cheapo to move a fridge into our basement
thank you jane and ashley for making my experience so wonderful
residents have trouble parking to get home and guests will get towed if they dont park in one of the maybe dozen visitor spots segregated in a back corner of the complex
not pricey like the wynn or anything
i thought she would have at least cleaned it before moving in
both our garage door springs broke at 630 am this morning
my old hot tub died after many many years
i found jansen after a friend had done a lot of research and homework on him
pluslast time mario came out i had to leave him alone with the house and he did a great job  notified me when he was about finished so wed be back in time
i was very pleased with the friendly service they provided and the price just cant be beat
i will use terry for all my plumbing needs without a doubt
i had high hopes for merrit
i love supporting good people
i dont even think they do background checks on some of the people i have had to call neighbors
looking for someone who will become a friend through the treebuying process go find julie at moon valley
instead it is offset about 8 feet
the store had at least 7 employees standing around and talking with each other
i wish zero stars was an option for these folks
even my husband not a prince fan enjoyed it
um no thanks
overall this place can do a lot better for making their residents more comfortable
they were done quickly and my windows are sparkling
he gets all nervous and i try to explain to him what it is and he doesnt seem to understand as his english is poor
i called  spoke to 2 assistant managers who just wanted to argue w me  make me regret spending that kind of money there
in addition he broke a very expensive personal item with little remorse
it took him about 2 minutes to diagnose the issue and about 30 to fix the broken piece
i asked for the manager he said no
the first set of people did only an ok job
i called them asking whats going on
one of the employees began talked in a rude mood to my son asking to stop doing that
i know people here now who have had the same work done i had done at a 13 of the price they charged me
ill be using steve again
i have been using noosa for several years for pest control and for a termite issue they found
at no time did he move the vacuum to any other of the 11 ducts i had paid for
the plumber was not an expert failed to achieve what we had asked them to do and we were charged 130 for work which was an expert could have informed us was unnecessary
we found some great fabric and delivered the chairs to bob
there was a lot of parking
give them a chance you wont be disappointed
and he gave me knowledge
michelle lindsey julia  brenda are very friendly and always a great help when needed
he told me that the water heater companys installation would void my warranty on the roof if not corrected
i didnt have that much furniture
happen but in my eyes it is how those situations are rectified that show what a company is really about
its nice to be home
this is the worst store ever
i would recommend this business to family and friends and will use again should the need arise
i complained to the manager about this issue and she did apologize but then tried to defend the awful behavior that came from her employee
the other told me that my whole line needed replaced as there is a crack running all the way through
i will use them again when i have a pool issue
i contacted sterling services and steve the plumber asked me to send him a picture of my issue
we highly recommend him and will definitely use him again if we ever need another inspection
i received the final bill and met with her assistant at the property and gave him the bill
even without that i would say the price is well worth what you get
all the people i communicated with were great and prices are very reasonable
she was fantastic
they are cheap because they have huge windows of time to pick up your stuff and to drop it off which is okay if you dont need your stuff at an exact time
my girlfriend and i called multiple times over the course of three daysno responsecall back
the packing process was relatively straight forward albeit tedious
i purchased their livingsocial deal for vent and duct cleaning
he gave us a call 20 mins before arriving which was nice
ralph was incredibly helpful and worked with me to get the best fit at the lowest price because i needed a lot of material
second time we needed an end table
i have to set up a personal router for stronger signal
we have since given up
although i hope to not need his services again in the future if the situation arose he would be getting a call from me
they were as fair as they could with the bill giving me discounts if i paid in cash
i have already recommended them to several friends
i would have him in my home any time
he did a great job of explaining the difference between regular  ceramic tint
cost me 2k start to finish for 20ft of flagstone being removed and replaced
just a great selection of tile with a modern direction
jesus did a fabulous job of matching the original rock and plants
i absolutely love this place
yes they charged me
im actually writing my first
neal came out we explained what we wanted and he instantly understood
we have a small backyard and we werent sure how much we could do with it
this company deserves an a rating
i definitely suggest them
andy called an hour ahead of time to let me know they were on their way
i called them back that following day because i cant take off alot of time during the day due to working full time and needed notice if he was coming or not
my sister has been an authorized user on my account for 13 years yet she was told that i had to call att and add her again though her name is on the bill
do not move in
these guys set the bar for customer service extremely high for others to follow
the delivery crew barely spoke english which made it really hard to communicate they also broke our dresser our armoire and put together our babies crib upside down and none of the screws were tight
its now my go to place for so many things garden accents i have my eye on a fountain statue  many kinds of furnishings  home accent decor etc thank you lynn for making the experience at global such a special one
he stopped answering calls and no response to text
your technician maurice was absolutely great
price for that was 100
therese kowal  karl wiger
it truly sucks that a brand new place is going to be trashed in no time flat  also the ceiling and walls are very thin so you here everybody walking above you and even hear the toilets flush thru the walls really loud and parking has become very tough because they dont have enough spaces and have no assigned spaces yet
my recommended change order  for you to pay to dismantle and reinstall hundreds of square feet of pavers in order to install a new transformer and new wire connected to the new electrical outlets at the barbq or near the fireplace that zonaworks installed as part of the contract
also i agree with the other comment security was a joke
soft touch moving was on time efficient friendly and very fairly priced
i definetly agree that residents should not be charged  for amenties that are not complete
this would have been waived in my other residences as i was always in good standing
i had some concerns after the install and john the owner came out personally
casey is very professional and they can accommodate any of your cleaning needs
absolute disgusting business practices
will absolutely use frogbox again
i have had both my mercedes and bmw worked on at this shop and both service sides are equally good
after calling the office 3 times and finally yelling the third time they had carisa call me
the work is excellent
mike personally came out to my house to do an inspection and evaluation of the problem
i would call the store and complain but no one answers that number
they are super helpful and always available if you need them
dont go anywhere else
always answered my call or called me right back
i had store credit that i acquired from an online purchasereturn because i had payed cash and had to turn it into a gift card to make my purchase
they are very thorough with their service
you dont piss off the person whos in care of your expensive property and i have zero faith in this company to do right by me
this is a very modern cityliving building so the apartments fit that style
same cant be said about using my harmony 350 remote to control the joey 20 box
stray cats all throughout the neighborhood
the complex has won numerous awards for landscaping and general upkeep
the roads here are torn up and they bring street sweepers in quite a bit just making a bigger mess than before with all the dirt  i pay rent to have paved roads not live on a dirt road
the diagnosis and repair was done within two days at less than a third of the cost
i thought they were pretty good then
they moved the pianos without issue the two times i have used them but scheduling with them is a joke
i knew he was doing us a favor it was a long day for him and a drive in the opposite direction
alsothey used a more professional grade cable for avpower in the cameras vs what wane in the box which would t have been long enough anyway
all in all it isnt a terrible place to live even with these minor gripes and i look forward to better days
my apple tv was done for but they were very helpful and i didnt have to be there for the maintenance repairs which was nice because i was at work all day
i would certainly use them again
but its very apparent that they really want to do a good job and make a name for themselves
the outside of the hotel and lobby may seem plain but the actual rooms were like apartmentssuites
take notes sara if you think its okay to be rude and to lie to your tenants your employees will also think its okay
i use yelp alot to research new restaurants since we havent been in the area long but have never left a review
topnotch professional work
there is no better place to hope for any diy project than lowes in bedford
i also kept apartment very clean and vacuumed constantly because i have allergies yet they are charging me for steam cleaning of the carpets which is complete bs im leaving the apartment cleaner than when i moved in
lowes told us that the cost of the measurement would be a credit towards the installation cost
waste of our money really
cant wait to switch to a cable tv freecogeco free
my husband and i wanted to go local and we are glad we did
i would never recommend this complex
gets on my nerves
add the 10 from before and we are pushing almost 30 minutes
the next day the base coat was installed no mess
weve already set an appointment to get the rest of our rooms cleaned
in the end if i went with this company i wouldve had to pay 1430 give or take and im actually saving on my end since for a storage unit and a budget truck came out to be under 300 just be careful with this company when selecting them
melanie took the time to really listen to my needs and find the best options for my space
i hired don about 34 weeks ago to put up our fence in the backyard
great homes one of the better builders in dr horton and direct lake access for owners
the first time we used them was 2 years ago when moving into our rental
if you are ok with no furniture dishes and living out of a suitcase for a month then this is the company for you
i called today and he picked up an hung up the phone now i go to voice mail
i finally said i wasnt paying them to admire i was paying them to move
dont cry and whine unless youve done all you could
just got my bill and guess how much
the system is an even bigger joke i think they bought the cheapest system possible
before you pick up that phone to call a plumber ask yourself if you want to take a crapshoot or if youd rather get honest reliable and professional service at a reasonable price
ive found that im typically compelled to write a review after a particularly bad or particularly good experience
we wouldnt think of switching
brown and tan will embrace a room
during the moveout process i worked with another my townhome realtor april nelson to ensure that this process was smooth
somehow the first company missed the huge hole
gave me some tips on how to keep our units running efficiently
this company has never failed me and i would recommend them to my mother
it worths for 145
his knowledge of the pool system had me up and running in no time making me wish i would of called him 3 weeks prior when i first obtained the pool
he was very nice and very professional
what an amazing experience
he is very professional  knowledgeable and courteous
they called me back said they can be at my rental 1st thing in the morning
they charged what they quoted and did every single thing we agreed upon plus somehow they brought my yard lights back to life
the store was clean organized and the clerks were very pleasant
horrible whoever answers this phone says hello then hangs up i thought this was a cleaning company i guess not
ron is fantastic
the scariest part of this was that my son had been standing in front of that mirror not two minutes before it fell
we were new to the area and had just put in new carpeting last year
my boyfriend is the fedex ground delivery person for the area that pie snob is in
one of their contractors said if you didnt like the work you shouldnt have paid us
he wasnt very gentle and damaged the lighting cover for one of my pendants
they were very nice and professional  never rushing through the job or made me feel stupid for asking them questions
recently i bought a new home and needed several trees and bushes around my pool
im sure most people visit here if they are looking for something that they cant find elsewhere but home depot had a better selection
made me two keys for my car for less than half the price of what a dealership would have charged me
he doesnt try to upsell me on parts that i dont need
i had a wonderful experience with this company from scheduling to the actual move
i had several realtor recommendations from friends in the area but none of them were responsive to me because i was over 6 months away from actually moving
hes honest and fair and he was there for us every step of the way
they were so great
they did just that and showed up quickly
the cleanup was no fun but the fact that do it right came out asap and got the problem fixed the same day was fantastic
i highly recommend dave and campbell mechanical
prompt courteous on time great customer service technician was reliable and knew what he was doing diagnosed and fixed the problem that afternoon gave us tips to maintain our unit went out of his way to make sure the ac was up and running before he left this was in the record heatwave of 2016
well he was all smiles and telling me everything he would do  never even taking out a measuring tape it was as if he were selling himself
money well spent strongly recommend george brazil
by section 102 the womens restroom on the main level had only 4 stalls
stan is the best realtor ive ever worked with
the corporate office is a phoenix based number so a refund should not take 3 weeks
for sure will hire them next time i ll need something to move
hopefully the big wigs in my company can see what trouble you guys are realize you are not worth it and switch to another provider
after checking everything he discovered a bad motor and changed it out
such a nice place to call home
from time to time the window display is interesting but the bulk of the furniture inside seems silly
company totally unresponsive
we had them both pack and move us locally and everything went off with out a hitch
she is completely unwilling to help resolve any issues with the property we are renting
the price was also reasonable in comparison to other companies i called
to this day i find it funny that my hubby and i purchased the last portable ac the store had remember guys this was last february
they sent a repairman that basically told us that since it turns on fills with water and empties that it works
the same guy named carlos
they are 110 better than before they were clean
super friendly over the phone to set up appointment and the plumber went above and beyond with toilet install and replacing a part that would of cost me 2  the amount anywhere else
i recommend this  its a great way to build your retirement account  it was a tricky purchase because it was a hudowned foreclosure and initially our bid was accepted but ultimately turned down by  huds part because the feds have rules for iras that hud was unprepared for
i was shwasted  every night so theres a chance thats why i thought it was so comfortable
the experience was positive and the work was done efficiently
the folks at twc are also miserablebad attitudes etc
they called and confirmed the move couple days before and arrived right on time
i reviewed chandler court a few years ago after id lived there with my family for about six months
i made an appointment and was told to come between 8  10am today
they have different spots where you can grill
we found out that we could save a lot of money by refacing our cabinets instead of replacing them
and the problem was not easy to solve
it works out perfectly every time
we got up this morning to more water leaking from under the water heater loud and constant drips from all faucets and a knock on my door from my neighbor telling me we had flooded their yard
setting up the initial appointment was easy and i was prepared for the 34 hour audit
would recommend to my friends
i have lived here for 2 years and i cant wait to move out
i also found him very friendly
no matter the size of the residence or the level of cleaning services needed i highly recommend this business
the actual harmony apartments overall the community was quiet
i kept thinking why i had not taken advantage of this place sooner
we wouldve preferred to have enjoyed the larger pool twice if given the correct information
in the end i did get my phone back and i took my ipad mini 4 to a different company which treated me very respectfully  an issue i wont even get into because i got my phone back from wookie so whatever but that goes to show you that i cant even say my thoughts or i wouldnt of got my phone back
my wife bought 2 summer indian skirts
they provide for free use 4 large clothing containers which are 3 feet in width and depth and about 7 feet tall
this place is fine when you are talking about product quality and variety and cost
pool daddy came highly recommended from a friend i am so thankful i called him
would definitely go back again and cant wait to do so
information was taken with great care promise of an email confirmation and telephone call from representative confirming appointment stated
i narrowed it down to 4 contractors based on yelp reviews and set up appointments with their salesmen
i emailed the company directly to inform them of the situation after i heard about this from the referral obviously embarrassed and there was no follow up or apology
so my wife and i went back and fourth carrying the chairs and the table to the customer service counter
the gym is also pretty nice and they offer a free yoga class every wed which i love
they were helpful when selecting the material and even let me and my fianc pick the specific slabs to be used for our kitchen
thans for the great service
michelle and her staff are great to work with
my clients often have credit issues from all over town
he got it fixed after doing a number of diagnostic checks and inspecting the entire unit
he gave us tips that will actually keep us from needing to call him back any time soon and cleaned up after himself
after scott came out we waited three more weeks for him to show up but he never did
i do go to lowes too  i just happen to go to hd more
they are ethical and have great integrity but more importantly they know their stuff
after he left i called the companys office manager to tell him what had happened
cristen was so helpful with our home buying experience
as a real estate investor i know this service is extremely valuable
this company is a joke
i went once for a job interview and it felt like i was in a startup office
i definitely appreciate the follow up from the company after i wrote them a complaint but it seemed more like i was getting worked over than having my concerns addressed
i would definitely recommend
they seem to like to let you know theyre alpha males but they gotta preach that to some other shmo now
its pretty disgusting ive decided to move out two months before my lease is over but im still paying for the two months that my apartment will be vacant i willingly did this with no argument because i understand lease terms
horrible customer service
he found issues that we never would have thought of
my husband made the call to search for contractors to reside our house
great service excellent job on the carpet
one of his employees will do the work
outstanding customer service
this is a 5star business on yelp for a reason
nothing was too heavy for kyle to move
after contacting the company they scheduled a different tech to come and correct the problem
each couple had a junior suite and the staff accommodated our request to have our rooms next to each other
once you move in you will get a crappy apartment and they wont care about fixing it up for you
supposed to sign in but have personally noticed that doesnt happen with a lot of folks
it was a problem with how tubing was installed so he cut it flicked it off and on and the furnace began to run properly
from what i observed with how the salesperson was with her his demeanor and approach was perfectplus he was patient as she really had no clue with what type of rug she wantedother than the fact it was a runner
highly recommend taking a class here especially from linda martin
within 5 hours my ac unit had been replaced  was up  running
thanks again justin
i justi cant
we had to call our home warranty and make a service call due to the water heater malfunction
my brother also had his house painted over 5 years ago and still looks great
the fees are flat no hidden crap
since we stream a movie almost every night we wanted to be comfortable
it seems like there is a different crew in my home each week
nialls was recomended to me by a friend so my expectations were high
they even asked if they could take a 5 minute break
i have had access at my house now three different times
they charged me 195 to replace a 15 dual run capacitor
after he left are noticed our satellite would not stay connected
he was friendly articulate and did everything properly
i was a walk in no appointment just called to find out where they were exactly and they were able to squeeze me in while i waited
called sin city after checking out reviews on yelp
im a foreign and it was my first purchase here in usa all the bureaucracy was scaring me
thrilled with our garage repair
i have called twice to check on it and have been told that i will hear back within 24 to 48 hours
it is exactly what i was looking for to secure our home when we take trips out of town
the price was very reasonable to remove tons and tons of rock and install artificial turf
i will continue to use them and no one else as i always get exceptional service with them
exactly what youd want without the huge corporation bloat and unreasonable pricing
update the owner is actually continuing to text me nasty profanities
he checked everything before leaving and we couldnt be more satisfied
i can always get an appointment within a couple of days of calling
no help whatsoever
hes knowledgeable and trustworthy
i havent had great customer service like this from a property manager or landlord in the past
i have had to either send multiple emails or finally put in a call in order to get a response
so i had her pull up the comps and based on that i said feel them out with a verbal 55k offer on the one listed for 64k so we can start the back and forth
i have used fontaine for floral arrangements for years and the owner is frequently introducing me to new flowers and other gorgeous media for center pieces
yes they also provided single wash detergent soap
i made a huge gigantic mistake signing with solar city
i have written a review in the past about oneguard and the customer service representative gloria petersen but today i am writing another
i gave up
youve come to the right place
overall todd was confident and competent and is just what the weary las vegas market needs
the apartments are absolutely beautiful and spacious
they offer that extra piece of service
they showed up on time every morning and the job was completed on time
i contacted gibson landscape services to get an estimate on replacing an aging irrigation system and doing an overall cleanup of our yard
that is it
view was nice  36th floor
actually this has happened before
not wanting to spend a week without my couch cushions the owner agreed that i could take them down there one weekend to get measured and then bring them back the next once he ordered the foam and wait while they did the final cutting and stuffing
thank you reba we appreciate everything that you do for us at ascent at papago park
today the spring on my garage door broke and both of our cars were stuck in the garage
i paid for insurance and the insurance is not covering the issues
everything started off ok with this company until i needed some plants removed and changed and i found out they hadnt even turned the water off where they had removed the plants so i was paying to water the ground also they hadnt adjusted the water where it needed to be lowered for a plant that was changed
the sub contractors used for laying the curb were rude and inconsiderate but rob did everything in his power to make it right for us and all of his people were fast efficient and courteous
two big pools at the site with full service and surrounded by glistening buildings
and i met a lot of good people
everything outside was safely moved out of the way the landscaping plants were treated with kid gloves and all was put back in place on completion
no management or anyone around
jose was so friendly quick and thorough
dj and his team were able to sort through whatever problem they encountered and provided a instant solution to resolve the issue at hand
i would definitely recommend cool guys as a trusted outfit
as retailers they place orders and receive from distributors regularly
its so easy to book they even went out of their way to set up a special schedule for my apartment
another thing im used to with other carpet cleaners is the upcharge to remove tough stains
would highly recommend this company
if you need a reliable no hassle and friendly guy tyler and youve got maids is an easy decision
called michelle  she scheduled a 930am the next daysaturday
unprofessional and untrustworthy
i was not about to commit to anything so i told him that i would think about it
wouldnt hesitate to call again or recommend to others
their service is okay though not exemplary
asked her if there were applications already in for property she said no
i would recommend them to anyone without reservation
they used to have decent quality however it has gone completely downhill
4 the furniture in the furnished apartment is not the greatest  however it looks classy and well put together
its a pleasure to do business with you
after choosing the door we liked she added options to make the door truly stand out
he came when he said he would he did the job in the amount of time he quoted and the bill was exactly what we had discussed
theres a lot of employee turnover  at the end of your lease theyll try to keep your money for normal wear and tear
they told me that they would not waste more than two people on our apt
thank you very much for your suggestions
worst customers service ive ever seen
no friendly faces there anymore
stand corrected on this company
im not the only resident who has complained about the staff
it takes two to three phone calls to catch him when he answers and then he noshows for the appointment
the thing i like the most was there waiting room it felt very neat and comfortable
he had by far the most unbiased industry knowledge and knew a lot about which units require the most repairs since he does service also
shaker square as a neighborhood is highly under rated
also when i reviewed the housekeeper who did not meet my standards on their internal site they asked for comment
the inspection report charged me for too many small items and i got a few removed
what a waste of time with these guys
i called and they sent guys over in just a few minutes
it may be my fault for not understanding how yelp works but i didnt expect the only communication regarding this to be based here on yelp
they told me anything they break will be fixed by them
great experience overall
no no its just on the truck
when our cable company came to fix a problem with our cable modem they accidentally hijacked the security system cables
the property is nice
it was worth every penny to me
i got a great deal through livingsocial and will be having my homes wimndows done too
you can read the other reviews here to know that the deadline came and rob and his father disappeared
happy i decided to rent here
and now  im moving back i called them right away
the walls are thin and i could smell every single meal my neighbors cooked
you will be disappointed compared to the value that we received from this company
he saved me and my husband about 190 month
the front desk girl is lying about calling 7 times and leaving messages
thank you barry and thank you mission west pools
they worked until it was finished and didnt seem to be in a hurry to rush thru it only to get to the next job
i requested a quote from jet and one other company at the same time
they dont tell you this at all but expect payment for something they quoted wrong
they have a keurig coffee maker which is nice but i didnt notice until the 3rd day that the nice sealed little coffee cup kit had a sticker on it that said they charge your room 350 for each cup
he was very courteous knowledgable and most of all he was professional and we highly recommend alaskan but mainly robert lol
i couldnt imagine a better experience with any other real estate agent
the service tech came in as promised at 9 am he found the problem fixed it in about 5 min walked me through ways to avoid it in future and left stating that i will get the invoice from the office
best service call ive ever experienced
if you would like pictures of our beautiful big daddy pool message me for updates on its deterioration
staff is a revolving door but always helpful
tech also told my wife earliest they could be back was next week
ok benefit of the doubt there has been a mistake so i go stop in and explain whats going on with brad
now that the job is finished im just hoping that more leaks wont occur
original post i choose this company based on reviews and was very disappointed
then i showed him my kitchen faucet leak
dont waste your time on these apartments
theyre very very reasonably priced and very efficient with their job
this review is about the lack of integrity american west has
fixed my garage door for hundreds of dollars less than what i was being quoted by other companies
i had to leave for work therefore was not here during the installation
wow i have no idea why this is still in business
customer service was spot on and they accomodated for my busy schedule which was fantastic
i cant believe how amazing our moving experience was with el cheapo movers
shouldnt i be placed in a spot where i can actually spend money
very nice job
i would definitely recommend them
suprisingly it was very busy on that chilly eve and that kept him busy too
they came to our rescue
my now 299 tree was at nearly 500 with the tax
this has been an excellent experience from beginning to end
the doors are gorgeous and feel like they will last forever even with lots of daily use
the living room area and the bedroom area also have separate acheater systems so thats even extra nice   especially since i was freezing my butt off and my friend sleeping outside on the pull out bed wasnt
easy access drain pipe  insert snake water drains but not sure if the pipe was cleared
adding in elevators would be nice
never even gave me the 2500 gift promised
hee hee smart man
hired because recommended by porchcom
by which time its august
i strongly suggest you buy flooring from a reputable company who manage or at least check on their fitters
dont know what has happened over the intervening years but  it is unfortunate and an expensive mistake for me
i have never had desert landscaping and he knew what every single one of those plants were
a very nice guy and a great help
they handled my stuff gently and took care when i separated out my fragile items
i was told my plan was being discontinued through verizon beginning the first of the year
they provided same day service arrived on time and were very efficient
i tried contacting them directly but they never responded
love the room but apartment doesnt look like model
ive used arizona school of real estate  business for appraisal classes for close to 10 years so when i decided to get my real estate license this school was my obvious choice
when we moved out they tried to charge us for things that we never even had even as noted in the lease and things that were okd by our portfolio manager
as i was about to leave and reschedule my moveout inspection samantha comes over and says she will do the inspection with me
they were supposed to give me a quote on a gas heater for my garage they never did
ginger helped me stay in my budget and got me what i wanted
overall this hotel offered great value and was comfortable minus the random incident
he has no crew or techs relying on him for reputation
as loyal customers of guard o matic we had them monitor our rental for our 1 year lease
he was sensitive to my situation and did all he could to accommodate my needs
flaky and a complete waste of my time
i highly recommend lizard heights glass
surprise surprise surprise
the ac is very loud when its turned on
the one thing i always point people to are the refurbished tins they make into wall art
they said they reached out to me
seriously hire these guys
i called the company handling the situation phoenix financial twice
if you are homeless and have no other option for a place to live this is the spot for you
once againi havent cracked a book open in over 20 years but i feel like i am learning and excelling every day here
wish i could give o stars
he went into the back to get the battery i had requested when he came out with the battery he as well as pretty much the entire store noticed a giant dust storm moving in
and that is much worse than the filth the sketchy people  horrible stench i didnt experience bedbugs myself but others did
working in the plumbing business as i do there are plenty of times i have need for concrete cutting and patching to be done and i always use and refer my clients to belville concrete
they took care to keep the house clean even though it was snowing and made sure we were completely satisfied before leaving
in fact after a little while i was saying thats really fine and they wouldnt stop until things were totally perfect
i was so furious i couldnt even get names
i called them after he returned and once again they were very rude
the price was reasonable but i still wanted to get the other estimates to compare
i truly couldnt be happier
he came  gave me a quote right away and was at the house the same week
im glad we were around to check on the job so we were able to tell them which pavers were loose and needed to be sealed
i told her what i thought soon there after i get a call from khan from old republic he starts asking about the fridge and why he should send anyone out
when i get compliments on the clarity of the cameras i always recommend in the sky to my friends and neighbors
3rd choice was    when i bought product i said sample chipped they sd no problem wont happen after installed
whenever anyone in the broadmor neighborhood of tempe needs a plumber his name is always at the top of the list
sure i still shop at the big box stores for materials etc
what a waste of money this was
but they failed us with less than luxury  living standards
first he was punctualgreat start
another star for the unbeatable location
only has foreclosed houses owned by people who dont know anything about the site
my only small issue with her is that she was very scripted and robotic
will definitely be contacting this company for all of my air conditioning needs
i am furious
it would look ok for a bit but after a year all those light spots that you missed will show up making it look like tiger stripes
we needed new carpet and we went with a friends recommendation and called paul at integrity carpet
2  you want the lowest cost and cheapest possible  this company came in second on the price chart meaning three other companies are cheaper than sams quote
i will definitely be calling them for all my tree services
terminix responded to our call the next day
at that point we were just heading out to the store so we rushed and didnt get everything done so we could get back in time to get the ac installed

my vehicle looked and smelled better than it did when i purchased it at the dealership
they just forgot about it and tried to cover it up
sound familiar  jake a
they worked super hard and took great care of everything
they failed to come to my house today as scheduled
it wasnt until after i signed the lease of satan that i read the reviews online and was horrified at what people were saying
also they didnt want to pay for parking spaces mandated by the city 1 per every 25 beds in a building so they copped out by making the three bedroom rentals 2 bedrooms with an optional third loft space so the building technically has less beds
they worked fast and their prices were affordable cheaper than many other places
it was a great experience
my friend and i chose the mid day break package as it was moderately priced and offered the services i was looking for in a spa day

we immediately called into the store and spoke with the manager of the exterior dept
every staff member  office and maintenance  has gone above and beyond the expected helping me haul furniture responding very promptly to maintenance requests and regularly checking to see if there is anything i need
i had use another company before this and they did no where near the job that young did
i will admit that i ended up cussing him out because i was so frustrated
i really wish they would do something to turn around their negative attitude when someone brings constructive feedback to their awareness that will only help them be more successful in the long run
when i tried to call and complain 3 times they never got back to me
you know the issues at hand
great convenient location
sadly i will not provide my business here

this is what is stated on the receipt all labor performed by the above named company is warranted for one year or as otherwise indicated in writing
the hotel was really nasty and the staff was rude
they must have run out of sliced beef because mine was made with hamburger
place was a bit overpriced but was the best apartment i had lived in out of the last 3
i explained that my husband and i are buying a new home and that it currently has tile counter tops and backsplash and i wanted to get an estimate on granite
originally my fiance and i came to fanco to purchase fans for our brand new house that we just purchased
i would definitely recommend them and would certainly use them again
seriously idiots running this place
they are always on time in range with their quotes and the quality of service they provide is beyond expectations

i have referred several friends and clients to 1st rate because i know they will never be disappointed
id be surprised if they are still in business in another 6 months because they obviously dont care

i can only hope that with all the cellphone companies to choose from ive saved someone the frustration of going with them
and i am writing this review after the apartments have changed management and now is called the haver on thomas because i feel that there will only be a continuation of bad practices

my experience of nw handyman solutions was great
what happens if you are elderly and dont have one
he was able to fix the leaky pipe while cutting a minimal size hole in the floor and he charged exactly what he had estimated
by far the worse place ive ever stayed in

ct our sales rep was very helpful in making sure our windows were measured properly and we understood all of the different options available to us

the job was done well and in a timely manner by guys who were friendly and professional

i said oh i think i will
they also specialize in hardware for the home screws nails ladders brackets cleaning products lightbulbs you name it
really old fashioned service and attention to detail
they were ready for me when i got there great customer service it took the amount of time that alex said it would and most important my car looks great
they were just as stunned at the terrible treatment
why go anywhere else
it was quite a job to do the 220 move the spa and hook it up

however when you buy a lamb that will cost at least a couple of hundreds you expect to get also an equally impressive service
confusing and something they should fix
a functional stream of communication ya see
within a matter of seconds they had responding to the inquiry and set up an appointment when my wife and i would be in town for the closing
they never bothered to call me or the home warranty company
he was very nice and very professional
i explained again i could not find what i needed and that was why i called a dealer
they did a great job and more important they are friendly
i especially appreciated that don overexplained all options before i made my decision
needles to say miles fixed everything great and saved us 1000s compared to the other guys

thank goodness another coworker advised me against that
this was an awesome experience with this company
my third call was to a woman that handles payments i expressed to her my concerns and she repeated to me what i told her and said she didnt knowcome on
they came to my house and assessed that it was an issue with my ac unit
totally bummed out by our change of circumstances but hey nothing we could do about it
the kinetico system is fantastic
i talked to a salesperson named josh
the pricing is better than any where in town and for the quality and time it takes he truly is an artist
being tight on money we decided to start bringing boxes down to where the truck would be loaded two hours prior to the truck showing up
have requested management find our tree delivery the correct one and fix the situation
in the office
but when it comes to the hoa or the property manager and his assistant they have been nothing but disrespectful and rude
i highly recommend this company
the toilet in the master was leaking water on the floor luckily we know how to turn the water off
delivered on all promises and julian was easy to work with
i described to the lady i spoke with the part i needed
after a short decision i determined they couldnt live alone anymore and had to immediately downsize their housepossessions and move them out of state to be with me into my house
the fact that plates come with a choice of three sides
also a drainage trough runs along the edge of my unit which means water can and does enter the units
i had family come in from california and i should say the entire family that being said the house was a mess and i called emaids for a cleaning this was the first time ive ever used any cleaning service and i must say when i spoke with frank he assured me that i would more than satisfied with their service the staff came over the same day i called and just like frank promised i was definitely more than just satisfied i was extremely pleased and very happy with emaids service frank you are true to your word and i will definitely recommend emaids to anyone who needs their home cleaned thanks again the wife is talking to me again
he is unethical a liar and a thief
good luck with that
i was a little worried when the technician came out and didnt fix my pump that sounded like a jet engine
we recently had a remodel done on our bathroom and it turned out better than expected
this is a big inconvenience for us here
colburn enterprises has been fantastic helping with plumbing jobs both at our home and also our small rental property
better off hiring a local cleaning crew
they were on time knowledgeable and costefficient
luiz hes a great guy
for photoshop not working being the initial reason i brought the laptop in
last year the entire garage flooded and most cars were totaled
im sure the amount of time theyve spent on the phone not dealing with this issue would exceed the cost of rent abatement by now heres the real kicker
i would like the entire system checked
i believe he said the fan motor was going out or had gone out or something either way screw ahs but thank you alex
she does such a great job cleaning the house and doesnt miss one detail
no matter how clean things seem
i went in for a new hose for a toilet and one of the guys noticed after i had purchased the item that due to a new vendor for the item the length had changed and it probably wouldnt work for us
he even matched the very reasonable price of my existing pool cleaning service
plus the backyard
sandy is responsive professional extremely hard working and just a very nice person to boot
i would come back for another
we value her expertise and  professionalism and recommend her without questions
i really do not want to write a book on how bad this contractor was so hopefully this gets the point accross
never leave disappointed
they all deserve a 25 raise for putting up with the negative reviewers on the right
they packed my whole house 1400 sq ft into the truck in 15 hours and unpacked everything into my new house in 15 hours as well
this was the most stressful move we have ever had
if youre worried about your lower back dont worry about it hire these guys
2 service visits 4 phone calls with hours spent going in circles and the internet service can not be fixed
she was hesitant about the serviceman coming over and selling things she didnt need
so i could have gotten an upgrade played with fabric options and still payed almost 1k less
i asked her how much it was she told me 70 an hr
the facilities are great
a little under 2 hours later everything was done cleaned up and good to go
quick response time great prices and easy to work with
i also booked them on very short notice and they were still able to get the job done
i came to lakeside to get my lawn and garden prepared for the spring
the view we have from our apartment is unlike any other
there is already a hole in the ceiling
extremely unresponsive and downright rude like either the company or the seller personally did not want to sell the house to us
salesman was very pleasanttom
the location is actually pretty great because you are near the awesome parts of down town and great bars and restaurants but you arent paying the outlandish price
in january i reported that the dryer in the house was behaving weirdly making lots of noise and getting the house really hot when it was running
it was the only place i looked at lol
it is unfortunate our past two reviews do not have a better understanding of what a home inspection includes we are inspector of structures not blinds door stoppers and cosmetic issues
my other favorite thing is the events they have for residents and contests
doit center refers to solon hardware being a member of do it best aka hardware wholesalers incorporated
the crew came in fully prepared and performed all maintenance in approximately three hours
he seems to know how to do any home project
tim and carol were great to work with
i never got an answer
we had this company assigned to us by american home shield the tech
she did the research sent me photos and followed through until completion
best decision i made was moving out of this place
but like my first statement said their fish sandwiches are the best the reason i even found out about this place existing
she straight up lied and told me that they cleaned things they obviously didnt touch she said they cleaned the cabinets and the stove top which they clearly didnt do and then told me if i wanted things to be really cleaned we should have bought the more expensive package
we also still have you guys moving blankets at our house too which i also told the guys on the phone
my experience was different
i would very much call them again and may have to as we have some other lingering small but necessary plumbing issues to resolve
her workers are incredibly thorough  not skimping out on doing the hard work and doing it with gentleness and respect of our house and belongings
we moved thank god
update  after a great deal of persistent on our parts the company provided a 15 refund which we finally received more than a year after the original move date
i also have an old republic home warranty and they sent am pm to my house didnt really have a choice
i would even say that sometimes people make mistakes
she hung up on me when i explained the problem and claimed i was being rude
repair performed freon added
the staff are awesome and very helpful the bad  people smoke outside their apartment and they put the ashtray outside their apartment it smells horrible so many dog poop  people were always parking in my parking space
all 3 of my dogs lay in it for 20 mins at a time so it must not be that hot
it is absolutely impossible to sleep through
his process would penetrate and neutralize the smoke odor in the carpets drapes chairs walls mattress and even the duct work
ill be sure to send along my 600 receipt from the company thats okay with a different mailing address
super friendly and fast
they have a customer for life with me now
we live on a large lot and had over 1100 sq feet of turf 1000 sq feet of concrete and over 15 ton of rock put down
the place is nice and clean inside it is tucked away in a commercial area in one of the suites
one company electricians for hire literally bulldozed through new irrigation pipes and electrical wires that we had recently placed in our yard
they also have a savings program you buy their grey card for 100 to save 25 on all full price items
i wasnt looking to make a bestie i was looking to get my unit services and have him leave
all employees were well dress and well mannered and customer satisfaction was top of their priority list in addition to getting everything spotless
walked in had a small wait
getting annoyed since my alternate local plumber had me for 11am if i needed him
i never heard from him again
to top all of this off every time i see someone signing a lease in the office they look like they have just stumbled out of a trailer park prison bus
they were kind friendly and very helpful
the fatherson team alex and larry were courteous and kind
i still have not seen the apt up until the move in date and now they want to keep my 20000 dollars
i waited 2 days for a plumber to come and nothing
this was the second time we have used move for less and we would use them again and definitely recommend them to anyone who needs movers
she told me they no longer do the four hour cleaning special and wanted to know when i purchased my groupon
no accepting responsibility
visit the safe store
it cost me 95 for a shitty estimate and 2390 in emergency surgery costs to try to save one of my pets today
if i werent moving outofstate i would ask paul to come clean my car at least quarterly but he provided a stack of business cards that ill be passing out to everyone i know
not sure if the management is dishonest or just poorly informed
nulooks overall service prices and their attitude was exemplary
the store rep finally placed the order for a piece of flooring that was too big for what i needed which would of made my floor boards completely uneven
i prefer a higher floor with a view of the strip therefore took advantage of your high floor upgrade for 75
i went in there filled out there 1 page application
i will use them again soon to clean the tile of the house
alberto at the front desk was fantastic to work with getting checked in and ready for my event
they refuse to fix our plaster color
dont move in here
plus he let us use a coupon
we had an overgrown side yard of roses and cannas
big job to say the least
they were in general very nice but i was very disappointed with how things played out
they provide phone line internet not cable internet so right off the bat its a dead tech
i am busy and picky home owner from los angeles and investor in los vegas
so lets see you defend this comment
in any case i was scheduled for today 71217 9a11a
i would not recommend these apartments to anyone other than hockey fans as it was nice to be able to walk over and catch a hockey game anytime you like
i highly recommend tower at tropicana
everyone in the leasing office has a major attitude problem
the same night the problem reappeared and they sent out the repair guy again
i installed on thursday and friday a friend wanted to come over for some scotch and talk about his dads impending big exit  so i went to the system and looked at the onscreen program guide and it said watch this program or record this program  clicked one button and walked away and everything worked out fine  excellent quality picture and really simple intuitive commands and remote control system
arrival quote was a 2 hour window
this whole place is beyond infested with roaches
cant praise them highly enough
go for the sunfilled patio
everyone in the front is nice but i dont really go up there for much
kris showed up on time and with a great attitude
stacy has a great knowledge of the real estate market
especially if honesty and integrity are important to you
i needed to have over 1400 sq ft of pavers done in the front yard back yard and around a swimming pool
no apology or explanation was offered for my inconvenience or the dishonesty of assuring me the backflow area had been cleaned up
but they called me to let me know they were on their way
omg heaven on earth
this was by far the worst move we have ever experienced
i was looking to buy a used pool table on craigslist and needed an estimate on moving it
they said that they received it and everything is fine
he answered all my questions and was very thorough
we needed some maintenance on our airconditioner so we decided to call adams
this company doesnt care about the customers
we werent disappointed
i used this moving company in jan 2017  the crew was prompt courteous and energetic
they have each claimed that the other is on the hook for insurance claimslost itmes and i havent received a dime for my lost and damaged goods
its pretty close to the strip so if you want to walk 05 miles you are right there or you can cut through planet hollywood which you can see from your hotel
very pleased with jdr  contractors
definitely not the way i wanted to spend my birthday and i expected better since its rated as a 4 star hotel
she put herself out by coming with samples a few times until i decided what i wanted and always answered my text messages immediately
it was an ordeal but overall they did uphold their end of the deal
i called got apology that they had been really busy
i only had one maintenance request fixing a lock the entire year and it was fixed in the same day
if i could leave no stars that would be a good start
they were very flexible with me as i was waiting on construction to finish on my home
do not book these people if you want someone reliable
disregard virtual memory score and hdd score
i didnt enjoy people ignoring the no glass in the pool rule which resulted in the pool having to be emptied cleaned and refilled especially when it was hot out
so here i am back at lowes
i was going to do the job myself but life managed to get in the way and i contacted floor works
came out for an estimate shortly after the initial call quoted us an affordable price and then got it done a week later
we took a quick trip to our new home in immediately began to unload the truck and put everything in its place just how we wanted it
lights were always out and i would have to walk from my car to the apartment in the dark with alll kinds of teenagers lurking around smoking and drinking
we used kevin for our garage floors because we were thinking of moving
had a total of 3 autos done here
guarantor and parent 201213
great place for landscaping my neighbors have asked who we use
so that was the biggest upgrade
broken spring and rollers replaced and back to working order in about an hour
went back to wexmans because of how they treated us 20 yrs ago
not sure but i took it as if you dont want to go with his idea then they wont bother
they just replaced our failed builder ac unit today 4182016 with an excellent frigidaire 16 seer 2 stage unit split with gas furnace
the complex next door has a lot of trees and very very loud birds so be aware
it finally took me calling and demanding a supervisor for someone to answer me monday afternoon when my move was saturday morning
he also has a simple way of explaining stuff to someone not familiar with computers
seems very secure to me the glass in my estimation is about an inch thick so all you would be robbers beware
so we moved into a new apartment without carpet and weve only lived there for 2 days and the door was broken the sink was broken the towel holders were lose and would come off our bedroom widow screen was half way on most outlets didnt work and lastly our peep hole was painted over and the leasing manager knew and said she would fix it and never did
my unit is near a main road but all the buts i find are on the side of the  yard that is next to the resident covered parking area where at times i leave my screen door closed and the glass door open for the breeze and a nasty smoke smell comes from the lady that sits under the parking spot and throws her butts wherever including my yard
the tone was worse then the words
used them to clean my house when i moved out
he tried very hard not to call out others in the industry but said that if someone wanted to get an extra 600 out of you they could have just said this obviously he did not and was i pleasantly surprised with the charge
i called sunday night and left message with answering service
we recently moved to az from ca and called sterling based on a recommendation from our handyman
heres the amazing part  they were able to fix the door for under a hundred dollars
o lawrenceville is fantastic to live in
security patrolling the grounds
had pro audio do a surround sound system in my house and they installed my tv on the wall
they were on time careful gracious nice guys who did an excellent job
not only was he there prior to the scheduled time he had canvased the neighborhood as a part of his inspection
this company is shady and operates outside of codebait and switch tactics and takes advantage of people
he assessed the problem and it was a faulty blower motor
i took it to leslie pool supply they took it a part while i was there replaced a couple parts put it back together and didnt charge me because it was still under warranty
when we arrived our suites were not connecting
it lasted for three weeks until we had an additional problem
i appreciated their flexibility in scheduling
i had 2 needs
i also made theist are of not visiting the nursery before hiring them big mistake
apartments i loved the layout of my place
any maintenance requests have been handled straight away
room was really nice but i could hear the people in the room next door
when i agreed they completed the work by a complete clean up of the debris
the office are cunts and dont care about their tenets

wave house had agreed to spotcheck the walls  but obvious dirt was still on the walls

joey was professional courteous and arrived quickly after i calledwithin an hour

aqua science was amazing
as a las vegas native i see my share of hvac vehicles driving throughout the valley hear several commercials on the radio and receive a great deal of promotional mail with deals and discounts
takes about a week or so before they even show up to do the maintenance
however if you live on the east side of the complex where all the three bedrooms are located its ghetto
when the movers arrived they were also very nice but said there was no way they could move my stuff in the time allotted
moved our two story house into another two story house in triple digit weather

i have moved a lot and most of the time i would use two men and a truck and i always had issues with them either breaking my things or just very rude behavior from the movers
the gentlemen on the phone told me that someone would be there before 11 but that they would call when they were on the way
we live here right now
we had recessed lights installed and with a few other electrical additions to the house

never work with them again and far away from them
the guys fixed my baby and i was thrilled
my kid could have built a better house
oh not the adventure of discovering new activities and restaurants or meeting people and making new friends
these guys did a tremendous job
but the main reason for my one star review
so much for the dillman brothers
entire cabinet of crafting supplies turned upside down how in the hell does this happen
this was quite a learning experience for me
gates are rusting out property upkeep has gone to hell and frankly they dont seem to care in the slightest
when they made an appointment they were there when promised and continually checked with us to made sure we were happy
so i recommend call him truuuuuuuuust
staff is pleasant enough
each time maintenance comes to the unit they claim to address issue yet nothing has been fixed or even modified and management has not shown much concern to the matter
she was able to schedule someone to come out and hang my pendant lights the same day
we have used handymen services in our immediate area and they take a long time to do the jobs plus now they just dont even return calls because they are too busy

seriously after we had so many issues and after spending thousands and thousands of dollars in your store
these guys are using groupon to rip people off
a company can ask for whatever the general public is willing to do
i paid 90 to replace the screen
i reserved a deluxe suite and it had everything i could imagine
i believe one of their names was danny he was excellent
maybe they have too many properties or not enough staff to handle the work load

the sales person had no idea how to use a computer to verify that i was getting the right part or if they carried parts
at the end it is 39401 with tax

update  update after i posted this review on yelp last night tommy from a1 contacted me
he called again a day before he was scheduled to come out and left me a voicemail stating that he would come out as scheduled and to call if i had any questions
and then we were only hold for over 20 minutes trying to get a hold of a representative
so we reluctantly without choice had to find somewhere else to go
my water heater also broke to the point my kitchen flooded so maintenance replaced it but now my shower only stays hot for about 510 min at a time
ive used this company for years
i scheduled my car for the next day
every time we contacted them they acted like they had no idea there was an issue in our apartment
we had to have pest control come spray our house every friday morning for a month to get rid of the problem
very much recommended especially if you have dogs
their customer service was great especially their delivery guys

whether the job is big or small i will always call kendall
the latest issue was when my next door neighbor upgraded their service with cox and i lost internet phone and tv for an entire weekend before they would come out and fix
a week ago my garbage disposal went out and if you run any water down the sink water is pouring out went to the office on monday and after two phone calls someone finally came down on wednesday and said yeah these break all the time ill get you a new one dont use your sink or dishwasher until we get the new one

he is personable knowledgeable and dedicated to finding his customers exactly what they want
they also cleaned all the floor tile and grout throughout my home
i just recently had my closets re done and a wine bar put in by this amazing company
a few of my friends have used them now as well
the email read
at this moment i would like to give the complex no stars but that is not an option
for example they could tell my daughters bedroom set toys etc
i heard bad reviews and gave them a chance but when you pay good money that you work hard for you expect good service
after agreeing to a price jim had the gate installed within five days
other than that ive learned my lesson
even the bathroom fixtures hadnt even been wiped down
i didnt have one drop in the home

all in all i loved the restaurant and couldnt believe how beautifully set up it was
beware you might want to buy two or more there will be no leftovers here
it came out perfect
they have tried sending others out and i havent liked any
not only is this annoying its dangerous and potentially harmful to the equipment
the service was not as personable as i have experienced
my ac was working perfectly fine decided to get a check up and not even 20 minutes this guy breaks my unit
they made the process seamless from start to finish
ive been through a traumatic experience that has rendered me an only parent and my 7 year old daughter homeless and this guy thinks he needs to be a jerk to me
we picked some colors and signed the contract used credit card
the natural sunlight is gorgeous and we never have to keep lights on
went somewhere else first that had a bunch of 5 star ratings and had to have them rip it off and refund my money after getting bubbles on every window
all movers are accustomed to disassembling simple furniture to get it out of the door
i probably overpaid but mostly because it was our fault for not having everything we needed ready to go
by the way the contractor reimbursed us for our troubles

they also did an amazing job jengaing my belongings into the rather small uhaul truck i had rented

they robbed me of my ridiculously high hold fee
bravo to the management and staff of national first response

after i again explained the nature of my complaint that i posted on yelp mr schroeder advised that he would honor my contract and would send the  technician to check on the traps and remove any dead rats that were found
they did an amazing job installing everything and ensuring it was working in perfect condition
all the written negatives are true
the cost is 125 and you have to use a laundry card

kevin v was a true professional with concern for the customer
he asked for and we provided the original invoices for the furniture pieces to be replaced
i had my home guarantee on the phone and they went back and forth and ultimately he said he was only responsible for the toilets
only gripe i have is they are expensive even with a special coupon

points for that one
which is true but when you have wait that long its outrageous
all in all i would say stay clear of this place unless you want to pay for an overpriced apartment and have nothing but headaches
i would definitely recommend jeff to anyone who needs their garage door fixed
he is rude often makes sarcastic remarks and will avoid phone calls from you if he knows you are calling with something he doesnt want to deal with such as when something is broken and you are looking for an update as to when someone will be coming to fix it
he offered multiple solutions for our issue and discussed all the possible outcomes

the owners are genuinely good people who have a passion for their trade
evening manager chris makes sure that every goes as simple as can be
after at least 7 phone calls the only one who responds is matt who was the representative that signed us to the service
im not sure why they sent out two separate parties to complete two small tasks on the same day but whatever it got done
i have absolutely no doubt with proper maintenance and cleaning our new finish from bnd will last us another 25 years
this place has great potential but non existent maintenance and poor management has ruined the place

these are the nastiest apartments i have ever seen
he had something around the chimney that collected any debris that fell out of it a big blanket or something

large store plenty of inventory and very friendly sales associates
all that radiant heat from the large windows is completely gone
come back and then install and paint the trim
owner was great over the phone and the service tech was great
we actually drove 35 minutes to get the remote starter installed here but it was well worth the time and money
very highly recommend them
they will come and do an initial estimate and dont charge you more if you just want to get a cleaning done every so often rather than on a regular schedule
such a shame because at one time this was the best hvac company in town hands down
it also looks great and we are very happy
he returns calls promptly and is always on time
the person indicated that they never received any messages and that someone had been out to diagnose the problem and that they had to order a replacement part

our formans name was aldo he and his team were not only professional and incredibly polite but they were very efficient
sherry arrived promptly at the scheduled time
i wasnt sure if that was true but we were on a tight budget so we took a chance
at this point i wanted to personally search each worker but obviously didnt
they even helped me clean up and take out the trash once we were done
they did not leave until absolutely everything was done
i asked of your company something few in the state have done
we were very pleased with the price we paid and we are happy to recommend jaycox to anyone
no wonder this business has such high ratingswe had our garage done today and it is spectacularenjoyed watching a very talented crew including shannon do every step flawlesslyhave seen many competitor floors and this one appears superior to anything else i have seenwould recommend them highlyon a humorous note i thought shannons name was ken and called him that all dayand he was too polite to correct me
upon move out the deeper we got into the garage to remove our belongings the more roaches and spiders we discovered
i was introduced to gordy zorn through a firsttime homebuyer client and was very impressed with his thorough description to her of each of the items on his inspection report
in the final days of our closing terry worked around the clock to ensure that we would not lose the house we had invested so much time and energy in
you sign up for the entire year and they suck the money right out of your account every month
i cant say enough great things about this company
craig and his family are the only ones i would trust my personal valuables
between his honesty fast work and reasonable prices i will definitely call him to check my new ac
they arrived promptly for the estimate and again to do the work
so we figured we could trust themwrong
example small things took many calls to complete
greg and coyote blinds are a great choice for nononsense good quality blinds
he didnt charge me for the assessment
i really enjoyed it the first few times i visited and still somewhat do but they need to keep it fresh to keep return guests
i had them come to my house to relocate some av wiring and while they where here they spotted some wiring issues on my home theater system and fixed them at no additional charge they even went into my attic to reroute some wiring
karen is fantastic
i strongly encourage everyone to support this local small business that truly values customer service
i am so happy and i am so satisfied in his work ethics
once again any that is looking dont move here
he pulls up into the driveway after work and they immediately start in on their pitch like vultures circling prey irritating and not how to get business and also the reason why we chose to go with another company
pleased with the repair
the second time was due to a  death in the family
will is professional and courteous always calling before he arrives at the gate so i can put the dogs away
two of them enthusiastically recommended arizona cold air
they try to take advantage of their residents because we are students and they think we dont deserve respect
the technician informed my mom that the fan motor was ready to go and would not last the summer
super happy that they responded with an appointment and repair within 3 hours
the lack of maintenance was ridiculous
we have had by far the worst experience with horizon
heres why pro 1 nice rooms the rooms are very nice
no one is answering the phone and i am about to panic
arrived on time worked hard and got the job done perfectly
almost calling every locksmith on yelp which most are closed sundays or closed early
they delivered our stuff to the new destination just as planned
thanks again to dave and his crew
the edges are smooth and perfect and the glass is as clear as if it had been tinted at the factory
3 by the time they were unloading the second load it was 9pm and i said just to please put the rest in the garagethey literally when we werent out there watching which we should have done were throwing our things onto the floor i found my golf clubs scratched sideways on the floor not to mention several other items damaged
she contacted them both verbally on the phone and in person and in writing
terrible business terrible company terrible customer service
please checkout the bbb because there are other complaints for this company as well also dont take the word of others on here when i have pictures that show the actual work was done and as i mentioned you can also call the city and verify that a roofing permit was never obtained by this company which means the city never inspected the roof so that means the roof may have been done incorrectly and since many homeowners are now complaining about heat insulation issues im sure it was done incorrectly
but for the 175 a week we paid price changes so call to verify with cable included and internet service for a dirt cheap additional amount it worked well
we have a pretty standard home
they said someone would get back to me but nobody did
if its your first time renting on your own find one wholl answer any questions and provide clear instructions like bruce did
add this place to the list of shockingly good customer service
i was very happy with the communication and i would happily work with them again
they were very helpful over the phone provided me a quote very quickly and were extremely fast in scheduling an appointment to come out and refinish my bathtub  shower
this was the best 100 ive spent on our house in a really long time
the location is convenient but that is the only compliment i have to give this place
i have to give a 4 as opposed to 5 star because there was a bit of runaround and confusion when they first got to the house but it was quickly overcome
i would recommend ll to anyone looking to remove the hassle of tenant or property mngmt from their lives
parking is first come first serve so i can see where that would be a problem however there seems to be ample parking
and yes weve tried calling
this was only because of the pressure that i put on them as their standard templating procedure would have added another 3 weeks to the project for a total of 1415 weeks
the beef was full of flavor and was juicy
they have already been paid by me and they tell me they can come out in the following friday
but i heard good things about this company from a friend and took a chance
staff was nice
his side of the story is he took a hit on the original carpet and therefore took a financial hit
they had every opportunity to collect the funds if they never intended to cover the entire difference for the fridge
kurt is great and knows what he is doing
on the surface at that point stains so covering with water up to the tile line is critical
he took the time to  answered all my questions
i think thats ridiculous you always have to come down to let your guest up
the salesman was already busy with another couple which was fine because we werent sure what we wanted exactly and needed to look around

there is no tact or quiet discussion to figure things out
a wall unit for our tv and master closet are next on the list
they didnt shim properly so one of the doorways needs to be adjusted

my hat goes off to rachel and roger who both went above and beyond to get this done
i have never been met with such poor customer service at a place that i am try very hard to spend some money at
he was so friendly and helpful
she could have conveyed the same message in a decent respectful way and although i might not have been thrilled about it i could have dealt with it

glasses tea cups etc
one thing i have witnessed is  bennett phelps can always be seen outside working right alongside his staff and helping customers with their questions and selection of plants
he was able to get us all the concessions we asked for and was not shy to tell any buyers that we would not concede anything
yelp has not let me down and neither did this guys  def recommend them to anyone
big thumb up
he just walked away quietly saying he cant charge me anything as he didnt fix anything

from the salesman to the delivery guys we had an awesome experience
if i had a choice to go with another company believe me i would
i was scared to eat or drink it
i am very happy with how my furniture looks and how professional this team was
the home warranty company refused to fix it and also said they would not cover the unit because of the recall
also they use massive amounts of tape which can damage your furniture and items when removed
the maintenance employees are so efficient and prompt
quick professional and a great price
i had bed bugs the first week living there
since i couldnt remember their name i had to choose a company id never heard of

all good assets for a business person
they seem to understand that a customer is important and we do not know the answer to the question we have asked which is why we come to the store to ask the question
the pools are connected through a walkway and we were able to find a spot on sunday before we left

they were able to schedule me for the next day
he charged us to change the pipe so he could remove the recirculation pump
we waited several weeks
the service was excellent and so was dealing with the office a trur family biz that treats their customers well
they were on time and very easy to work with
that never got answered
make your own informed decisions about hiring this company
food is terrible overpriced and room service for some pancakes bacon and water was about 54 says my friendif you are at the palazzo okbut here
my humble advice and suggestion to all the people out there looking to move in they will try to lure you with your sweet talks and promises which they will never keep and you will find out the dirty picture after having to sign the lease  you start living here because everything just looks good from the pictures but reality is very bitter folks
a neighbor also smoked incessantly and our place reeked of stale smoke
we cant say enough good things about leo valdez and at remodeling
also dont drink the water it literally tastes like the ponds smell
i went through three different landscapers upon moving to las vegas and none of them panned out

there just arent guys like john anymore
jeff is kind quick affordable pleasant and polite
i was in panic mode when my foster dog decided to scratch a hole in my rental houses carpet
normally i give this store 5 stars especially on there survey but just now i walked into the store walked by 2 people in the front without even as much as a hello
they were supposed to paint in 2 directions horizontally and vertically when i questioned why this wasnt being done i was told that they are spraying 1 coat and overlapping it with a 2nd coat starting about mid way through the first spray hope that makes sense not what the contract states i had to call travis who gave me some bs that good painters can do it this way without issue
the spa seemed really nice too wish wed had time for a massage
its one thing if they accidentally broke something and told us about it but to act like it never happened is just ridiculous
i never felt compelled to write a review on anyones business or their services till now
when we did get a response it was by email asking if we were still interested in an estimate and if so to respond to the email
what is the service call for
cox just raised prices again this month and this time by 12
my advice call another electrical company and save yourself the troubletime
he was friendly efficient and was so eager to help me
great service and attitude
they packed the truck poorly so it required 2 trips
you cant go wrong with a realtor like brian on your side
i did receive a call from the new owner after the first mishap and he was a total ass
recommended for dates and romantic diners
each cost 1200
i must have sent her 30 emails with questions since i hadnt seen the apartment in person
he indicated it was a new keyboard extremely unpleasant to listen to

we just bought a house a week before we had this company come and clean our carpets air ducts and dryer vent
after she mixed our paint i asked her a question she looked right at me rolled her eyes and walked away
firstly its important to note that in las vegas everyone and their brother is a real estate agent
at this time greg and his crew are just cleaning up our massive yard but i definitely plan to keep him on for monthly cleanups and hopefully a pool in the future
he wasnt pushing the more expensive films he just wanted me to know what they had and how much it would cost
it looked great was perfectly straight and i got a great deal purchasing some of the equipment through him
they never told us when we could see the property only kept giving us the credit speech  what they look for bad credit blah blah and we have none of these issues we just want to look at the house first
as well a piece of our headboard was separated from the rest of the bed making it useless to us
they left packing materials on furniture did not remove shrink wrap tape and other material as was contracted
i cant say enough good about them
if you have big or medium size projects to your home direct buy is the way to go

honestly i chose this business based on their name
truly amazing woman
since my carpet was still pretty new and had not been cleaned before they explained the stainmaster coating used on new carpet likely kept it from being more damaged by the dog spots but to be aware that cleaning it would wear that coating down slightly
they assembled it fitted the bed into it and placed it at different angles for me to decide how best to position it
i felt very comfortable with thunderbird if for one thing they are a family business which means their reputation is on the line with every job

finally being along the approach and departure path to phoenix sky harbor airport definitely adds more noise especially during the maximum departure and arrival times
he was very thorough
i wish more dog owners would clean up after their dogs in the dog run area but atleast the main areas of the complex are not full of dog feces
this was pertinent since the rentals at zazu apparently do not have inunit washers and dryers and my mom and dad would have stayed elsewhere as a result
we also had gotten two new puppies and found out that we could only have 2 pets
so friendly helpful and more importantly patient
i love the guy who sprays my house
we also discovered that hiring a good installer was equally as important as getting a good system
i moved on to save my frozen food from a total loss

however after putting me on hold they hung up on me
we have 11 girls and go every year
very unreasonable service and quality
let me start by saying that we are in the process of fixing items from a home inspection
ryan is a used car salesman at best and a complete snake in the grass who will spend hours making you think you are going to be treated like a valued customer but as soon as they have your money they disappear
yea well be there 36pm didnt show
it doesnt cost you anything to show some hospitality but lack thereof has cost this place all my future business

what more can you ask for
even in the heavy summer months they are worth waiting for
i had little to no damage to my belongings and was so pleased that i gave them a generous tip
notice the good reviews for key pm is from the people who own the home not the people who lease
youll pay more but if you cant do it yourself dont go to a do it yourself place
let say our experience has been less than pleasurable
this led to a misunderstanding
rust all over the kitchen dirt everywhere else
ive been nothing but courteous through the whole ordeal but if they cant bother calling back a regular customer why should i bother to continue as such
couldnt have picked a better company

arnold and his crew were outstanding
when i called cox back to cancel my services they offered me the package i original called about for the 200 a month rate
i also requested a quote for new equipment
the guy showed up on time but was visibly irate
i called to set up an appointment and was given a 2 hour window for their salesperson to come out show the product and do a quote
whenever i had a maintenance issue it was taken care of within hours or immediately if it was an emergency
super confortable and haveits own kichenet deffinatly coming again
our master bath is the next project
i had an appointment scheduled to get the house cleaned and about an hour prior handy called to let me know the house cleaner would not be able to make the appointment because she got a flat tire

out onto the streets
living in an hoa community we had to keep our yard well maintained and have never received complaints since hiring springgreen
theres also high end home goods
i left after spending over an hour with no assistance or acknowledgement
its surprising the lack of quality duct cleaning companies in the valley
more things keep breaking
we spent a saturday morning here picking out fixtures
they call a week later stating it would be 200 more than the estimate given because the tech didnt inform them i wanted the windows
but first and foremost this company was very honest and informative
rock cracked the windshield in the summer time
over the one year theyve sneaked in extra fees causing my bill to go up by three dollars
bobby tony and francisco were fabulous
most gift boutiques do not
they did it right the 14 minus was tamped and leveled and some sand over top the pavers were installed in the proper orientation at the proper height and elevations then the edges were grouted in and finally a fine silica sand was swept into all of the cracks to lock them in place if you are getting pavers installed this is the proper procedure
my upstairs neighbors lived like pigs

they even did minor repairs as part of their cleaning
i had decided to have my carpets cleaned before moving out of my current house because i had pets

they will be on time they will be respectful kind and most importantly your carpets will be cleaned and you wont have to worry about breathing harsh chemicals or your pets and kids laying in toxins
now it wasnt his department and he still walked over with me across the whole store to find exactly what we wanted
they charge an arm and a leg for service that they cant deliver on
this company was great
i cleaned every single item out and wiped the inside down
envision took over my old adt system with killer modern updates
its a market with the kitchen and dinning area located towards the back
the attention to detail and professionalism is second to none
the salesman gave us time to mull it over by ourselves thats right he walked away and left us alone to talk
we then had to go through the eviction process
george will always be my go to guy when it comes to cleaning my carpets
after i thought everything was all set and moved out of the complex i found out that months rent for my old roommate and my replacement was taken out of my bank account
while working she was always on time professional and courteous even when the scope of the job was changing
within minutes i noticed that the locksmith didnt seem to know what he was doing or have the proper replacement equipment
coming out charging us the money and they didnt complete the job
this was much appreciated given the tight conditions of the housing market and we needed to act fast when we saw something we liked
no problem i scheduled an appointment last week for today with delta mechanical with a window between 10 and 12 no technician showed
because i had one purchase that was 6 months interest free and one that was 12 months the finance department was appropriating the extra money to the 12 months interest free
so my son called at 830am and they said they would be shortly
we also found a lot of intentional damage hidden garden hoses and extension cords cut on purpose
a few hours later they did a second walkthrough without us and said it was not clean enough and so they would charge us to have a cleaning service come

made some great friends many of which i still hangout with im not sure where chella g was really staying but the food at bromley was is
poor customer service in my opinion
out in san tan valley weve had some bad experiences with security companies
rooms and clues are creative but not too hard
tech was friendly
this is hands down the best most effective pest control company in the state of nevada
i am a very satisfied customer of wendis and i would recommend her to anyone requiring property management services
exceeds previous installers work
i did my research i made a few phone calls then i spoke to donnie personally
mind you  i was now paying the landlord direct
instead of installing it anyway and just not telling me therefore leaving me with a faulty toilet id eventually need fixed up creating more quotes and fees they spend time taking the toilet back out and showed me what was wrong with the toilet
even my husband was impressed with the finished product and that says a lot
they are awesome
not even a chair until i asked them about my coffee table
my wife and i recently moved into one of their properties this month
in 25 years of home ownership weve dealt with a lot of contractors
by the way haggling of prices is almost welcome here
anytime ive had an issues it has been resolved within the same day
when he told us the cost we were like there is no way the work could be that expensive
when i explained to them that i was unhappy with how the edge plan was explained to me incorrectly and how long it took my phone to arrive they offered to give me a discount on accessories for my phone
popalock was there for me when i was recently overcharged about 300 by some nasty 247 locksmith company
thanks for the great service
however it is quiet and more secluded and the rooms are all very nice equipped with a mini kitchen with potspans blender toaster and utensils
however  they have proved unreliable and unable to keep their word
but then innocent clients are led to think the contractor they are dealing with is honest and reputable
allen  debi stober
i took a water sample to a professional and he told me that there was so much chemicals
on christmas we barbecued and enjoyed the arizona weather on our patio while another resident walked down the rows of apartments serenading everyone with christmas music on his saxophone i could not make this up ha

great customer service at an affordable price and no more problems with a backed up drain
thursday nhw called and said a tech was on his way so i left work got home and the tech was rude unprofessional and did not know what he was doing he figured out that the compressor was bad and would need to be replaced
wasim was my realtor and helped me to purchase my first home
they are all very knowledgable and always professional
these guys are the best
and dont haggle on the price just know youre getting the best product and best install and its totally worth it
pretty cheap for 4 bedroom and the staff isnt bad at all
but honestly indian steele dog park is great and is super close im just lazy
also their technicians dress and act professionally and everyone you speak with is customer focused which my wife especially appreciates
what a difference in service and expertise
i called the office and was told it would be 300 for someone to spray
scary and weird
apexs response was quick straight forward and fairly priced
after telling this to jarrod him and the owner were very apologetic but i was shocked that it even occurred
made the move so much smoother
he made sure i was satisfied before he called the job complete
i was assisted by lucky who was awesome
my insurance does not cover faulty workmanship so im stuck with thousands of dollars of damage to repair on a new floor
he helped me and he is amazing
i booked through mayflower tyler was my rep got a very reasonable quote and i felt good working with tyler
this is the first time i have been very impressed by a knowledgeable and helpful ac repair company
very happy customer and i am already referring them to my neighbors
he also was the one who completed the installation
great company with very fast response rate
and that i was to pay a 200 pet deposit and a 200 pet fee per animal
wow scam artists
we left happy customersthough it was a bit harder for one of us to brave the place we so easily associate with claustrophobia
comforting to come home from the park and see all of the exits blocked by police with a helicopter circling overhead
the price was so fair and so reasonable
i watched as they vacuumed cleaned the windows washed the car mats  all this should have been done by 2pm at the latest
the list of issues is too long for yelp and to this day i am still paying for their poor installation job
they are super responsive and always work to address any concerns or special needs that i have
rpm charged slightly less than other property management companies
throughout the entire conversation the secritary continued to call me honey in a derogatory tone

codys quote was very detailed and easy to understand where my money was going
the cox guy originally put my modem in the living room on the floor in the corner closest to the wall but it looked kinda tacky just laying there on the floor
ill use them in the future because they are simply the best moving company i have ever worked with
this lease has been nothing but problems broken machinary i have to call about for months still doesnt work 100 of the time they told us they needed to redo our floors because they creak displaced us 40 minutes from my wifes work in a hotel and left our home a complete wreck
i highly recommend jtb
will be back to change some more coverings soon
they were completely finished in 4 12 hours and asked for a broom and dustpan to clean up after themselves
no returned phone calls from dan or the shop
they even unhooked my washer and gas dryer for me
buy 100 in accessories and get 100 off bill
he did offer services but they were helpful like air filters being sent to my house
a lot of the tenants here including me are young adults attending college or will soon be  due to its proximity to cmu and pitt
how is this even possible
i would recommend this service
always pointing to irrelevant vague or ambiguous documentation in our community documents
professional my a
manager did care for customer satisfaction
and the exercise bar seems to be anchored until the end of time  great job there as well
i had the absolute pleasure of working with two gentlemen who had at least 60 years of experience in the paint business between them

2 i called the office line and was asked to wait so rude girl can find an answer
water heaters only technician don was a pleasure to talk to as he is a vet as well
thanks mike for saving me thousands of dollars
definitely worth the money
once he figured out he was losing money because of his poor and uneducated quote he left me high and dry
she finished well before the quoted time she had told me
i really recommend these guys
on moving day our two movers justin and thomas called ahead to say they were running late and arrived at the new time like they said they would
called housekeeping and they never came
he is honest straight forward and just gets the job done correctly
my internet speed is much better
are you shitting me
went in with 2000 and just wanted a small amount of firewood and to get a quote for our front yard tree trim
your website should make that clear
the proprietors are friendly and theres lots to choose from
i have had erik here on 2 occasions to address issues that arose in a home inspection
this last time they said the check was cashed and need to send in my bank statements to prove i didnt cash it not releasing any information about where and when this supposed check was cashed
ron was friendly affordable and fast
then quoted me 5400 and i thought they were being quite professional as they so carefully looked at all my items
i highly recommend alex and his crew for your painting needs
we just purchased our house and during the renovationswe unfortunately discovered black moldgiven i have two small childreni immediately called around to any mold companies in gilbert that i could reach that day
a very nice nonprofit vibe

we received a call thu to let us know the part was in  bright and early bill was back as friendly as ever and installed the part we needed
very fast service
i have spent much more on landscaping in the past and we are more impressed with this job
i have never had any issues with attitude from staff or maintenance and when i did have a leak in my ac they had a company out to fix it the very next day
i explained the situation
are you kidding me
thats my only regret though my mini fridge and microwave have served me well over the years
also for them to have luxury apartments they sure have an awful pool
they made us lower our rental rates to attract tenants and unfortunately the condition of the home suffered because we made a desperate decision to put a tenant in the home who was not as responsible
he has solved a long standing plumbing problem for me plus fixed my water quality
hes incredibly professional responsive helpful and great all around  hes always on top of everything
it was just very disappointing for a veteran to be told to put his flag away
when an appointment is actually made the ladies show up late and do not stay the full time
i paid over 600 to have an outdoor outlet replaced and a couple wires tightened up in a junction box
do not live here trust me
project pool and landscaping                 45000
the pool is nice but very crowded most weekends
keep up the good work we will keep sending it
call him now
well he didnt come and no phone calls
i am very happy with de george and will use their services in the future
but all things considered my time here was an overall positive experience and i would recommend this place to others
update  one of the things missing in the house were ceiling fansthe listing mentioned ceiling fans 3 times but there was only one ceiling fan in a 4400sf housevery expensive in a phoenix summer
final walk through on directions of care for next few days and i was out the door
they ended up fixing everything and cleaned up everything and i asked for 1000 off the cost of the roof being that i had to sleep elsewhere for 9 nights
the chocolate cream pie is just perfect
could not believe the rude woman at customer retention dept
they promote from within 4 of my techs were promoted to service manager
as also called later to followup and left a message to make sure i was satisfied
if i have a concern or need something retouched they are right on it my husband is a clean freak
i guess i should go into the business of repairing garage doors
do not book through luxury suites international or hotelclubcom
i was sure that they would tell me they were wondering if i was going to show up
will definitely use again
he mentioned they do kitchen cabinet painting and flooring installs
i used scotts flooring a year ago to put in new hardwood floors throughout my house
they told me there was nothing wrong with my unit and the reason the temperature wasnt dropping was because they tripped the circuit breaker
they arrived promptly after picking up the trees i selected at a local nursery
called northshore customer service and got a very cold shoulder response
we wanted the cabinets to be prebuilt so while driving around we happened to call mor at wholesale cabinets
i have never dealt with such a high percentage of unprofessional and rude people before
many thanks to oscar and his crew
dont roll over and take it or theyll just keep ripping everyone off
terrible and unprofessional services
to top it off they didnt even charge me
youll quickly learn that i am a big fan of pool by design and if i ever build another they will definitely do the job
the fee they charged for the diagnostic was very reasonable only 59 for someone to be out there within hours to check it out which would have been waived if the work had been completed the same day
it was so refreshing to have such respectful individuals helping us in a stressful situation
being super paranoid that they would mess up my billing i confirmed  reconfirmed the details of the contract with 2 separate representatives
i went in looking for japanese beetle traps and got a full lesson on how to deal with my pest problem and prevent it next year
for the price not a bad deal for someone to camp out for a while as they are looking to buy
they were really helpful with the service and they fixed my fridge with in a few hours
our washing machine is our fifth roommate no matter how little you put in it it will become unbalances and start a dancing party
i have literally been wanting to come here for the last couple years since i heard great things about house of tricks and they did not disappoint
also this company has the best trucks
looks can be deceiving
i appreciate him and everything he did for me
highly recommend their pbj
unless you would like to wait for unreasonable delays i suggest definitely trying to find a different store for your serviceshopping
we have moved several times in the last 25 years
no one likes to experience hot air blowing out of their ac vents at the start of summer in arizona
its a huge complex but at least where we are its exceptionally quiet we barely hear anyone ever and i work from home
my bf ended up asking if they could walk him through the hookup process and hell do it himself so thats what happened
bottom line he is solid

thank you justin for helping to make all of our dreams come true for our growing family
i placed my request with the warranty people monday night amy from shaffer n sons called the next morning and was going to have someone come by that day and then the tech called an hour later left a message asking to come by he said he was hoping id call within a few minutes calling him back
one year later they continue to function perfectly
we found them on the internet and immediately had a good phone call with michelle who listened to all our picky preferences
needless to say they were not here by 1230  i called them  cancelled my call  got another contractor for my water tank
i have lived here for almost two years but last year was so unbearable that i am not renewing my lease nor would i ever consider to move back in under present management
oh wait that would make it a little easier on the customer never mind
i am in a huge rush to move asap
the person on the phone was great
in the end we had to get our warrantee company to send out another company who found that the lines were still clogged
im sure you will have a good experience moving in here like these people who are giving 5 star reviews but good luck after that
talk about shedding some light on the situation  what a huge selection
they have their focus on the customers ultimate satisfaction
ravago group helped me purchase two income properties and have been managing both for me for a couple years and i cannot say enough great things
i would never recommend them
done within an hour 5 trees are super tall
harold came to both houses and saved us a ton of money
when i read a review i like to see examples of what was impressive about a service provider
i mean they were even running at one point
i found this painting service as a referral through home depot
ft of tile ordered with installation set up for my fathers house
the only thing good there was the tall man that out the tree on my car everything else pure rudeness and crap
their technicians were all polite professional courteous and hard workers
never had to use them but i know jordan personally for over 6 years
customer care nor any other store had been able to give me a clear answer or any resolution until today
i dont think so
what more could i expect
about 6 days ago someone came in and slipped a key in and out of my door quickly and walked awaywhom i had assumed was maintenance staff who just got the wrong house and moved on
great shop will do all my vehicles with him
just got to solstice a few days before our lease date was up to drop off our keys and grab our remaining items to find people inside our apartment installing a washer and dryer before we had turned in our keys with our stuff still in the apartment
we set an appointment
stew had the patience and resolve of a saint
this is with the hot water heater turned off at the power panel
they were thoughtful as well as kind the work was immaculate at a great price thank you
i gave him the correct address and i still had to wait another 30 min in the cold
i doubt theyre licensed but working under roi that is licensed
trim extensively where the bucket will reach dont where it wont result is some onesided tree trims
then he said if i say a word about this he will get his attorney and ruin our familys pool service business
masoud did exactly that
im not really sure where to begin with the issues i had with 777 movers so im going to start with a simple list
i left it with that hanging in air told carmine i needed time to think
all this for 179
if youre that busy deb why wouldnt you just wait out the day to see if i was actually coming like paula told you i was and just process the checks the next morning if i didnt show
we like the apartment well just deal with it
this is the company to call
richs extensive general contracting experience knowledge of city codes familiarity with metro phoenix and credentials and passion for his profession make him one of the best inspectors you could possibly hire
called saturday night for a service call and william came on sunday noon with a courtesy call before arriving
he does great work
when we unloaded our house full of possessions we found almost everything was perfect
if thats what youre looking for in your apartment search i highly recommend you look elsewhere
thank you so much
so they dump the load back into the mulch pile rocks and all
i have had several issues since ive moved here
our yard turned out so much better than i could have imagined and they made the design and installation process so enjoyable
he spent about 5 minutes looking up in the attic said the access was too small for my tool bag weve had other techs in the attic before through the same opening
i wouldnt have bothered reviewing if it was even close but given how high they were i wanted to give new customers a heads up
everyone was fabulous and willing to coach me on the process  or offer additional services never was i uncomfortably up sold or turned away for asking questions
the facility management are completely incompetent and the ownership  uh communities at the time my daughter contemplated living there and now the scion group  are the most unethical executives i have dealt with in 30 years in business
justins the guy
she is also one of the sweetest most considerate people i have ever spoken to
amazing guy with great professionalism
we had a rough start with cmk but chris owner is very personable and went out of his way to make things right
so 6pm it is
very professional explained everything and hung around to answer all of my questions even after technically the inspection was over
as far as i am concerned they have redeemed themselves
they were always very professional
thank you sarah for all your help
jack up rent on old tenants and lower for new to fill spots
not many high rise residences have a pool on the roof
if you want to see the email with the list and their agreement contact me i will be happy to show you
hello this has been a great apartment for five years
they did a great job and i am very happy with them
the high pressure sales calls started
it has been over 7 years and even though i no longer live in that home i do still own it
but as the minutes ticked away without internet or a person on the line it all started to feel hollow
appointment was set on saturday at 12 pm
and by the way if anybody thinks im not telling it like it is i have emails documenting all of what i describe above
i put his card in a safe place so i will have it when needed in the future
i worked with alex from steamplus to have my couches cleaned and had an extremely good experience
im doing an owner builder in which they called building department on me saying i was building a pool with no license
these guys are fantastic
she had excellent reviews and we gave her a call
i even asked him to show me how to do minor things so he could focus on major tasks and we could get the condo rentalready as quickly as possible
he just gave me the runaround
i was nervous for the outcome due to many horrible reviews but decided to give them a shot
i recommend using the online chat version and having every chat emailed to you for your records youll need them when you cancel service
would highly recommend
i would still rent from these guys if i wasnt transferring jobs out of state
they surprisingly have alot of guest parking covered amd uncovered which is nice if you ever have guests over
yelp wins again
they installed beautiful synthetic grass in the front of the house and great real grass trees pavers plants and flowers in the back
they have a weird cleaning charge of 25 where you have to clean the back of the van before returning it but it was clearly explained when we picked up the van and theres signs posted in the back of the truck
i did not state in my request that the repairs were an emergency
tree in our yard
he is a master negotiator and will fight to get the best deal he possibly can for his clients
i had to call for service on a sunday and was happily surprised when someone was able to be at my home within an hour
my husband was like wtf have you guys been doing
they took care of my major mold problem
do not do business with this company
my husband and i recently ordered a couch at design source
they did a great job of cleanup after the trimming and removal
reid also rewarded us with a second check for the inconvenience
when i got the keys to my unit it looked nothing like the beautiful model unit i was shown
busy saturday night kinda expected
they explained that they dont charge based on the dimension of the lumber but the predimension size then they add 10 for straightening
i would absolutely recommend flooring center usa
there price was reasonable for all the work performed
they really try to sell you on new units when they dont even wait until the part they fixed has worked
but as things go in life i was about 10 mintues late from 4pm appointment
after receiving delivery of a washer on 022517  30 minutes into using new machine its making a grinding noise and smells like something is ready to burn up
within 5 minutes eric was out front of my place
if you are looking for a place to live in cleveland you have found it
one morning i was sleeping in my bedroom then i heard some noise in my living room and someone is knocking my bedroom door

so i checked in  westgate last night around 10 oclock first room that was assigned to us was dirty
i would avoid urban at all costs their attitude is greedy and uncaring
i am shocked at how expensive every single hvac place is
the five stars are for davee
ive only had one short encounter with them but so far i highly recommend them and theyll be on speed dial in my phone from now on
i confirmed this on several hardwood flooring sites

i especially enjoyed sitting outside on the patios although there was an inordinate amount of insects in the summer
two thumbs up on service
i highly recommend vip cleaning service  professional friendly and efficient service
rob and team cleaned them so well they looked better then when we moved in
we live out of town and own 2 town homes
ok i have the key to the pool as a resident and i am sure he meant getting acquainted only with the minority neighbors
they showed up early and wrapped everything professionally
great group of people you wont be disappointed
i always receive overthetop compliments about the artistry of her arrangements for which i dont always get to see
very poor haircut we carefully discussed what i wanted and discussed what did and didnt work with my hair then the hairdresser did exactly what i said didnt work
when it came time to look at the air handler in the attic he told me he hated those ladders that fold down  they make him feel unsafe
maintenance takes forever to get to you  ive been waiting for 8 days just for new light bulbs for my living room then my vent fan above the stove just broke off so the whole thing is unusable said they would be there first thing in the morning still not here
you pay for your bucket at the club house then tale your receipt to the machine by the driving range and you get your balls there
they are professional and very efficient
since my last review centurylink has continued to show terrible customer service
this was important to us as we both work and to get home for a home appt is expected but kind of a hassle
lol last issue i had with them was the heating back in december
its obvious they take great pride in their work
when i call ive always gotten a next day appt
bryan and i had played phone tag for a couple of days but he was good at keeping his word and returning my calls
gave me a quote that i thought high but ok since we wouldnt be home they said leave a check under the doormat
i will turn to econolight first for any future electrical needs
they called when they were on their way on time and took care of everything
did they ever check the area to see if the problem was solved
dont even think about staying here
while they have expanded and had some growing pains jorge has been great
these guys tried to upsell me on everything and since i have carpet cleaning experience i was able to talk them down to a reasonable price per square foot
in our rental agreement the owner is responsible for the pool maintenance which is managed by a property management firm
i dont think he did it on purpose he just took mine with his
i will need to test it
the fact that these people have not even acknowledged me or returned my call is why im leaving this review
he had no problem finding my townhouse in the complex some people do
the offer itself was market value and supported by the comps
i posted a picture of this dolly fyi in case you cant believe what im saying
but after just 20 days he started to say the home price had to drop and then kept continually pushing for more price drops
we scheduled an appointment within a week and today i just had my cleaning
i decided to go ahead and invest in the ceramic tint offering and i have not regretted it one bit
i have had first choice clean my carpets numerous times and there is no other business i would give my money to
she starts to give me attitude because i was expecting a timely repair and she states the they come out to evaluate then request permission to replace said water heater from the home warranty company  then order the water heater then do the repair maybe thursday its monday

pittsburgh youve stepped your game up
i have had to have the solar water heater serviced three times due to leak in tubes
two pedestal sinks a stainless steel kitchen countertop with integral sink a pair of exterior french doors lighting fixtures slate sidewalk stones  this place even has recycled paint
they have merged or was ought out and now has a new name
i originally had two jobs scheduled with them but end up with only one
also i called to complain about the charges and no mention of storage and was told i was wrong by the front desk and owner
she was young but very helpful and knowledgeable
i wish we could post photos on here so i could post before and after photos of the rental house they have on my street
i wonder what the turnover rate for employees is at mmm
the loan officer immediately said we would drop the process
hopefully we wont be buying again any time soon but if we do we will definitely be checking in with the house team
called the emergency line at 7 am and now its almost 9 and nobodys even return her call
on the few times ive had to call them i have not had to wait more than 5 minutes and usually not at all
so i set up services to get turned on at the new house on friday but still need services on the old house
everything from herbal teas to collectibles and clothing
i waited a couple days and decided to go with the pet door through my slider
the service was just fantastic and they were in and out quickly
my house closed in less than one month and they couldnt have done a better job
despite the fact that the people who live down and across from you look like they belong on an episode of hoarders and must have been taught how to park by little richard
we highly recommend dw crandall
showed up on time
would definitely go back
i wouldnt bring my vacuum anywhere else
what a delight working with heather at the ferguson showroom
thanks again for everything
she was really helpful with helping us find everything we needed and gave some really great recommendations
a safety report on my door
he was professional and responded quickly whether by email or text
we have never had an install or large purchase here but the million times we have been here the customer service has never let me down
i just want to take the time to say this place is a joke
move in due to these rules did not go smoothly at all resulting in 2 attempts at furniture delivery
mark was very helpful in coming over within the hour to provide an estimate on my garage doors motor that was dead
brandon is an amazing guy and also a bit of a tree nerd
his price and service were both exceptional
making owning a pool more affordable
i good company follows up on inquires and phone calls within 24 hours
never had the tint heal like he promised on both my mom car and mines
the initial technician placed the cover in the bedroom incorrectly and a small portion to different color painted wall is visible
the condo im renting is very nice but i honestly wish i was paying rent to a much more professional knowledgable responsive and organized company every month
even the engineers maintenance men are very helpful and professional
i havent met anyone else though really oh
the call boxes are complete jokes
after 3 additional calls to both oneguard and the service provider runyon appliance 0 stars for them nobody has any idea of what part is required cost of part eta on when part will be approvedordereddeliveredinstalled
troy was right on time as far as the appointment for the estimate
all i can say is i feel deceived and lied to

parker and sons has always been my go to for the last ten years for any plumbing needs in my home

i have really enjoyed the past 9 months here at griffis
they just want to keep hounding you the cost is over 4000
their customer service is very bad
while the apartments are alright theyre certainly not worth the price
they then went to work
i was expecting they probably wouldnt be able to match all four
i dont know if they are the cheapest out there but they are honest
first off and my favorite part about working with this company is the fact that every time i called with questions someone answered and addressed my concerns
i have been a tenant with rentals america for about 2 years now and i have nothing but good things to say about them
business center with free wifi
we have been working with wendi and dana realty group for the past several years
he told me he will give me a call back to schedule an appointment when he gets the work order and will check his schedule and more than likely it will be saturday morning due to his busy schedule with other customers
i have the call logs
here we are 240 pm and still no call
ken from baker heating  cooling arrived within the time parameters of the appointment texting me when he was on his way
alberto beccerra spent hours fixing my phone even though he did not have to
so i ended up with a net bill of 100000
i contacted joe multiple times to give him the opportunity to fix his their mistake but he never responded
i then asked if we could just have our money back as i wasnt happy with the fact they sold us this ring on false promises
right from the start we realized that he had numerous attributes that set him apart from other real estate agents
she is down to earth intelligent and has a terrific sense of humor
their price was very competitive and we love our new pool deck
between gas food and hotel nights the costs added up
cox internet is not what it used to be
the install went well and both were very efficient in doing their work
john and his staff are very professional and their knowledge in what i needed to be fixed was surpassed
with the exception of two times they have been very attentive and quick to respond to our calls
it turns out that the other guy didnt even look inside
i will be having them back soon to trim my front yard tree
they seriously cannot stock standard timers or at least order them in a timely fashion
they dont deserve a starit was the only way i could post this
loved the itemized details
thank you ron
he did fabulous work and had reasonable prices i would recommend him to anyone
but im glad that it was take
he came out during our discussed time and called me ahead of time as well
a month or two after the install and alls well with my windshield
overall i am pleased and will continue this service as long as possible
i hope their boss is paying attention because these guys represent the company well
i think that is poor customer service
nick went carefully over every part of the home and pointed out the several safety hazards that needed to be done as well as documenting all other problems
this is exactly why people should yelp more
i am 7 classes in and the lessons have been great
the sales person said 30 days from digtoswim
this is the worst internet service that i have ever used
everything leaks ac always broken and we always slept with one eye open due to our concern for our personal safety
this company is the middle man basically
beware this company changes its name very often and now i now why
the repair is done and everything passed inspections and all is working well
she is honest reliable knowledgeable and most importantly ethical
in fact already hiring him to do another wiring job in my house this coming week
they had a lovely bag of microwave popcorn waiting for me
they said about 45 dollars over the phone
they felt shady and they were
after trying another hard restart and efforts to determine the source of the problem joann said that they were going to have to determine whether this is an outage or bad modem
i will continue to use them and highly recommend them for all your flooring  bathroomkitchen tiling needs
luiz remembers his customers and does a great job
they replaced my drip system and replenished the rocks
so i wait all day
we came in to buy ourselves some new phones
they dont value their customers at all and clearly dont give a crap about your happiness
we cancelled 23rds of our order after numerous phone calls of delivery reschedules
the entire building is always kept immaculate
simply clean organic refused to do a basic clean and said it was a waste of his time
in these days of hearing horror stories about mover you cannot go wrong here
you can order a 12 order of the 5 salads and they are still big
call it a home depot wannabe but thats like saying pepsi is trying to be like coke or vice versa  its okay guys there can be more than one
they unpacked everything and some of the guys even stayed to help me arrange the larger things i couldnt easily move on my own
i still hear go tow swat towing driving through the lot every night around 13am so that is wonderful
dont buy anything there unless you want to be treated very badly
natasha and her company is without a doubt the single most professional small business ive ever dealt with
from the truehonest and fair price quote to the amazing quality hard work that was done
they forge your name on the waiver and then they damage your furniture and offer you 60 cents on the pound and then the actual amount is determined by their arbitrator
i called my home warranty they told me i had to use this guy
i called and spoke to the owner he sent geoff out the next day to redo the programming
also the inspector asked if i wanted him to have them fix a pipe that was twisted a bit too much for his liking
as scheduled the contractors showed up on monday bright and early
who does this
7 parking is a nightmare
i needed to move out of a third floor onebedroom apartment in north scottsdale and into a second floor apartment 6 miles away
i called the office and they sent out a technician who told us the doors were installed incorrectly and they would need to take them back to the shop
he said it would cost 1200 plus freon to fix the problem
well never go anywhere else
they made this a fantastic experience i couldnt of asked for a better trusted company to help during this process
they charge you for every little repair such as a 4000 charge to fix track on sliding closet door
our movers were e garcia j hood d griggs  antonio
cue friendly neighbourhood box guy who found the right one
cant wait to get more stuff
all in all a pretty good experience
so much for reminding us so often about the glorious 50 rebate per phone that finally made us choose to go with the original phones we had wanted in the first place
when i was finally scheduled to have the measurement with nicole she did not show up
when i inquired with the teller about additional services and she asked if i could speak with one of their members i told her i was in a rush
they came out the same day and diagnosed the problem in no time
she was very nice from the start
i have come across a few other companies before them that were dishonest and did not do a thorough job
do not use these people
you have to call for amenities etc
pros the office staff were great friendly professional
then i had them put in a tankless water heater
when they changed owners the place got really awful
ed explained to us all the different types prices and was honest with how long delivery would take prices etc our electronic roller shades were just installed and they are amazing
i requested to have someone come out to show me everything about the operation of my pool
so i will be in contact with them a lot
they came and pressure washed the house
my blinds from lowes were measured wrong in the kitchen my bad i didnt compensate for the tile backsplash at the bottom of the window so the blinds didnt fit
the experience with this company has been great from the start
it took me a while to get comfortable with a service entering my house when i wasnt home but i have no problem with them doing so now
i called about a property to rent
they told me to wait 2448 hours and it would appear
at the end of the one year we had with them the total repairs cost more than hiring a repair man from the open market where there is competition and they have incentive to perform
very trustworthy and competent he performed all systems check and made the needed minor electrical tightening adjustments
mike was the designer and contractor for our 15000 sq ft brown ugly dirt yard
everything is fairly priced and they help you load up the stuff you bought if its too heavy
from start to finish i have been impressed with them and their level of customer service
i made a comment about the filters and the service guy stated he didnt have it on his truck
as i got to leave i then get told that the woman serving me had driven all day to get my shade and that for a 50 shade
paul is a young ambitious entrepreneur who knows the meaning of great service
horrible company i live out of state and rent my property
i had to take pictures of the roaches in order for management to override my request for pest control
great customer service
he must be a morning person cause he was all smiles so early
leak is now fixed
i agree with the other reviews that i wish i could rate them lower
it was a panasonic cg945
so them charging15 for service fee is fine but 35 to start plus an additional 50 to just use a jimmy
the rest of my stay was ok but not without issue
i started to hate the paint and was texting michael all day on a sunday
i wish it was possible to give negative stars
with that i stated i did not want them in my house and said good bye
after complaining yet again in march we have been told by management that this is common among complexes that allow pets and it is impossible to enforce the complex rules regarding this matter
i cannot recommend them
i gave them full payment so why is he harassing me now about a form that should have been given to me 3 weeks ago when i first purchased the furniture
besides the hostess wishing him a happy birthday nothing else was done for it so i was a little disappointed and i think he was too in that regard
if i have one more problem with this place im going to the department of housing and filing a complaint right before i start legal action
went here to have my windows tinted based on yelp reviews and they didnt disappoint
the driveway has a hill up to my garage so if it is icy my car wouldnt make it up there but i noticed that there was always extra salt on the steepest part of the hill
im pretty handy and figured id save alot of money doing it myself
a full kitchen washerdryer combo a foyer ya a hall way in a hotel room large bathroom huge bedroom with a comfortable queen bed which i kod into hard one night and a walk out balcony
mark came by to provide a very fair quote and explain in detail what would be done to complete the job
they showed up exactly when they said they would and took the measurements they needed
and do not expect your shipment to get to hawaii when they promise it
i even dug a trench around my pool to prove to them that there were no roots present that could cause the failing structure
i would highly recommend honest pool care with confidence to anyone willing to listen
well guess what 1 12 hrs later he still a no show
i have zero reservations about recommending c2 and charles moving forward pun intended
i was looking for a company to do our yearly ac maintenancecheckup
when the lease states a movein date it literally means that
thanks for your welcoming environment
i could not ask for more
by far the best customer service there is
when that time arrives the leasing agent is unavailable and then im told the apartment isnt ready to be viewed
i called and ten minutes later he was here to change it out
the guys were on time neat and thorough
glad we kicked them to the curb before the project was completed
it makes me and my friends uncomfortable
i really wasnt sure what i wanted
i know that this may come as a shock to the other reviewers on here but my service was less than stellar
if you like rving in a parking lot you will like it here
but if i do the same relay again and just need a cheap place to crash for a night or two this place fits the bill
when it was time to get the new unit they suggested installing it on a different outside wall so that it wasnt so loud in our family room
i needed this done but i feel that i got cheated and taken advantage of
they do an awesome job
i asked he to pass that message once again on to him which she said she would
i repainted the interior from ceiling to floor and pulled up the flooring and still the smell remained
the only reason i moved here is because of the garage
he answered all of my questions and helped me pick out a color that went with the transition into our bedrooms
realize they are attempting to upgrade
when i got home from work at 7pm there was still no hot water
mark did some troubleshooting for us over the phone diagnosed our problem told us how to fix it and we saved ourselves 300
so by the time he would arrive it would be passed noon and i had my kids school orientation to go to
i called during the window to get an idea of when they would be here
my dad who was in construction himself for 20 years frequently called it the best tile job he had ever seen
they were extremely professional and courteous
they gave me the 50 coupons if i referrer people next year my taxes will be free
there were other things good and bad but these are the main points after reflecting on my time here
thank you so much for the great service
the girls on the phone were dumbs as rocks and kept putting me on hold for long periods of time and these techs show up and dont know what the hells going on
they could have easily added it in and i would have not been much the wiser
these are thorough professionals who ensure your tile removal is painfree and safer
the representative  kimberly
and i share this at the risk of the being the old man saying get off my lawn youngins
i askd if i could bring in the check to pay before late fees are applies i askd
first of all if you have a sign on your door that say you are open till 5pm be there
stay away from jsm propertiesthey should be sanctioned for their misrepresentations
but having that acknowledgement and letting me know that they would be with me as soon as they could would have put me to ease
fidel and javier arrived today on time neat and polite
he goes above and beyond what he needs to do to make everything right for us even to the point of moving our heavy washer back in its original place when the repair was done
thus the six weeks
eric and his crew will be my go to pumber for this unit the process was seamless
that it did look like they were running late with other jobs
he did clear it with me to start texting back and forth before he actually did which i thought was just fine
i would highly recommend alex for all of your real estate needs
when we determined the pump was actually broken donnie came back and replaced it
they brought shop vacs tarps the works
their agent was very rude not only to me but also to my husband and worst of all he was unpunctual when we did set up a time
they can keep there set i will take my business else where
he is cheerful hard working knowledgeable and did a thoroughly fine job
there are 10 to 15 cars parked outside the front gates at anytime for the simple reason they rent out knowingly to potential tenants that have considerably more people living and staying in their residence than is allowed
this a review based on my experience with ephone
they also said that the regional thing didnt exist
paper thin walls terrible plumbingi mean basically spend a few hundred dollars more and anything better in ballantyne
the only positive experience i had with the polo club is with a lady who works at the front desk jeanne
my moms  kitchen sink was clogged so i googled plumber las vegas clicked on what had reviews
they have replaced or fixed the air conditioners hot water heaters appliances garbage disposal pool filter and a lot more
questions i specifically asked were about the upgrades in the apartment homes
purchased a bedroom set from their north las vegas location in february it is april and i still have not received the whole set
this company was greatif your looking for a quality window supplier at a fair price and complete satisfaction you need to check this business out
within 3 minutes you can be to whole foods starbucks banks or the freeway
thats much more than the modest increase that was explained i would see in year 2 alsowatch out for tricky little exclusions that now cost extra like hvac incompatibility coverage
the area isnt safe or taken care of trash and glass every where with  careless tenants who hang around from sun up to sun down drinking and getting high
the project manager lee ellis could not have been better
from the beginning all the experience seem to be all wonderful we were almost too happy about the whole process
desperately looking for a service repair center for my lawn mower i looked on yelp and found sohars
we paid a considerable amount of money to use this company and i am very sorry i did
they claim to have a pest control company
we will not be continuing our lease with powerhouse when it expires in a month
so they staged items into the garage  this got it out of the house on time but cost me more time and money to move the items into the garage and then out of the garage into the truck
anything else requires a cab ride
all work and installation was done from outside
landscaping leaves crap all over the place  its common to come outside to your car covered in leaves and green pollen
he never told me no and the best part was he let me buy my own slide and basketball
i inquired about tile and grout cleaning and he was extremely honest and said that the tile and grout were in great shape and it would be a waste of money at this pointi appreciate their integrity honesty and excellent customer service
i had to report them to the attorney general for fraud
outdoor patio is a must amazing atmosphere along with friendly and attentive staff
i didnt pay a lot for my cabinets and now i know they are cheap for a good reason
we wanted to start demo disposal and the roof
very nice great service and tasty stuff on the menualthough i had a bad experience because it was the first time i had duck  didnt quite care for it but thats not to suggest it wasnt a very nice place
i have lived here for about a year
i think he choose good shrubs but i think they were planted in the wrong areas
i said lets do it
very disappointed with new management violating laws with 4 adults and 2 children in a 2 bedroom apartmentmaking so much noise you cant rest
they know what they are doing
i suggest that if you are looking for a moving company do not go with elite movers unless you want to deal with rude customer service final pay to be way more than the estimateno official delivery datea whole bunch of added on extra charges  your things to be in worse condition than what they were when you packed them
they said it might take a month or so to kick in
he told me if i pay him the 75 copay in advance that total protect would cover the part for sure
we are so thankful for the information we found on yelp
from my initial conversation with ashley the owner i had such a good impression of the company
the technician was pleasant and rather sheepish about it  he knew the quote had no chance of being accepted
he was really careful to replace the office water heater over our brand new carpets too
do not use this company i purchased a groupon for 4 hours of cleaning with 2 cleaners and attempted to schedule my appointment online like it says you have to on the groupon and their website was down for weeks
we recently moved into the isle and our experience here as been fantastic
the pump didnt run for a day and a half  so the steps are slimy to the touch
the caulking in the shower created mold within a weeks time the air conditioner ran constantly due to the leaking walls making our electric bill astronomical and the water bill is outrageous it was ridiculously higher than living in a house with a fully watered landscaping
this pool closes at 700 pm
its hard to find that old school customer service anymore
they found the vacuum cleaner was bad and recommended a new one for us
ok so verizon gave me the run around and made it hard to get my buy out offer from sprint
this review is when my upstairs unit gave out yesterday
i am so impressed with this company
shady business practices poor customer service and treatment and shoddy repair work
hum maybe i was wrong
whether you have a vacuum or a ceiling fan to be repairedthere is only one place to go in this town
every day and night there is some new thing
the paint is absolutely phenomenal wonderful money saver and decent selection of colors
thats where i went to pick up my 2 free show tickets in appreciation for visiting the pawn shop and got a pitch to assist a westgate presentation in exchange for additional vouchers
i guess the time we spent at the beginning was worth it after all
they never showed up
great company and awesome personnel
these guys are great
the movers seemed to be in a rush to leave even though they hadnt even been working for long
the fixes would have ranged from several hundred dollars to just under a thousand one fix would have involved a very expensive part which is not their fault
greg had to use a 20 ladder to do the installation and i was worried that the ladder might leave marks on my light colored walls but greg was a pro and there was no marks or dings to the wall
their prices are reasonable and workmanship is quality
be sure to check in or you will wait for nothing
i just contracted my second paint job with tim from ameriprise of gilbert
there was no overspray or mess
whats worse there are a ton of college kids who like to rev the engines of their unmuffled sports cars at all hours of the night
i didnt see anyone stopping for breaks even when i heard their phones ringing etc
we got tired of looking and almost settled on some houses that were not what we were looking for
tenants did not seem to take care of common areas
one of the things that was actually specified was the fans would be dusted this wasnt done
i would highly recommend them
daniel doria must have spent at least 45 minutes trying to resolve my phone issue
his estimate was nearly 3 times what i paid another landscaper for the same work earlier this year 200 for mr torres versus 70 for the other landscaper
regardless of the reason it was broken and they did not off to repair or replace it but only to load it into the truck stating it was still useable
so it looks like my payments dont go to my account but someone elses does
i was worried that my kids and i would be without ac since it was past normal business hours but mike came to my rescue
no banging the walls everything was secured as i would have expected it should be
called them about servicing the filter and media replacement
security sucks there never see nobody
he was able to remove stains that i thought were not possible to remove and our carpets look so so wonderful again
my experience with safe  sound was outstanding
he and his staff were quite professional and we punctual i would definitely recommend him if you want a professionally installed system
when we first moved in the filters havent been changed the fixtures were filthy and silicone all over the floors and sinks from previous repairs
they said someone would return my call
youd be surprised
he went above and beyond what i asked him to do at no additional charge
they know the market and how to help you understand the complicated process of real estate in toronto
i would have thought that they would be more concerned about their service levels and customer feedback but its clear they do not care
we also had  mongolian barbeque shrimp blue and yellow corn beignets and the korean style baby back ribs  all were off the charts good
i highly recommend him
i was told that its a hit or miss when it comes to the parts they get from their vendors
our whole house now has one beautiful tile throughout and it looks great
for an o ring
doug did a great job and went the extra mile to fit me in and help me with moving something i could not do myself unrelated to the windows
this system is a joke
his price was very competitive
the have done small jobs to complete remodel on my home and have been completely satisfied
he explained to great details what happened where it went wrong
this is a holeinthewall type restaurant
i had a washer that appeared to be on its last legs as it was 15 years old and had been with oneguard for 8 years
i will be telling everyone to book this company to make your car continuing looking new and to protect their investment
i was hesitant to post a negative review they do know where i live after all but really
this company will never get our business again
well be using him again and passing his info along
no regard for the 8 years of home service with directv as well
a week after our condo closed we were approached by our new hoa and told that we had a 8000 new roof we had to pay for immediately
he was able to make us feel comfortable with the process and he has plenty of past experience which made ours even better
i dont have time for their bs
the community areas are okay but their community pool could use an update specially the pool by the hoa
make yourself available to answer questions and put the clients mind at ease
the ice machines on our floor were empty every single day so we wandered around aimlessly searching for a machine with ice
job well done
i dont get it
they went the extra mile to make sure i got exactly  the designs for my home i wanted
the man who came to install was on time clean and professional
i second pauls disbelief with the negative reviews for south hills movers
and the most reasonable priced i have seen
the one parking spot per apartment rule is ridiculous
the entire experience was summarized by our moveout inspection
now im out the 65 trip charge and still have to find another company to repair my fridge
if you are debating renting here let me fill you in on what you are really in for
there is a ton of storage in them and the water pressure is very good
we have used him on multiple occasions in the past    yup
moving in here sigh unseen besides pics on the website  the help of google was nerve wracking but everything has been great so far here at allanza
everyone is always so cheerful and eager to help
in all actuality this was one of the better complexes to have rented from when this was owned by camden property trust
the rental itself was nice and reasonable
want 5 star quality and servicethen a cutting edge glass  mirror company is the one to use
i can hear exactly where my neighbor upstairs is in their apartment
there were a few instances with the supervisors involved where they spent days up to a week trying to obtain documents which if they had just mentioned to me they needed i would have provided them because i had all the copies
i was in a time crunch and the distance of my property was going to be a problem so ultimately i had to go with another company
with 10 people we were able to fit into a suite and adjoining room
no fix no refund no nothing
diaper bags and book bags and strollers oh my
he did a very thorough job and cleaned up everything after he was done
we found leonard to be very professional he had a sense of urgency to meet our needs and clearly knows his stuff
prices are regular and they give lifetime warranty which is great because we all know window tint doesnt last forever
ehhhhthey gave me a 500 gift card when i moved in and a cheaper rental ratei cant really complainyet
plus we got a big discount
there were three movers who checked through our condo and got an idea of what we had and what needed to move our first
however the owner took about 30 minutes to send the pay pal email which again was a lot of arguing screaming at me and berating me  which i had on speaker phone for my family member and his employees to hear
during one of those conversations she assured me that the 140 in late charges im now seeing were just applied automatically and i wouldnt be charged
i loved the tint so much that i had him install an alarm system too
so billing stinks i feel ive overpaid by 2 months and still never got that straightened out
over all i wouldnt recommend this place anybody but college student or cheap people because we pay for a service that is not being given
you can polish a turd as much as you want its still a turd
back to the elevators  theyre filthy after every weekend and usually takes a few days to be cleaned
the place was nice although i do feel it was a bit overpriced for what you got
i look up at the hole and what do i see on the plastic tarp covering the hole
though i do not think the carpets looked terrible they  certainly had high traffic wear and needed cleaning
it was 530pm and we just got home to find our garage door partially working
first time was two days after we moved in
i became friends with my neighbors and we all had the same complaints
if i could not give them any stars i would they dont even deserve one
murders drug dealers robberies vandalizing are all regular activities
he is honest and reputable
recently bought our first home and this was our closing agency per our realtor
well see how long it takes them to replace the two that died
he is a kind a guy you want to introduce to your family and good friends
wanted a simple backyard landscape with some specific features in it
i told the associate mike exactly what make and model i was looking for and told him what price i would get at lowes
tried to get a plumber to the house for three days
will use again but hopefully not too soon
we set off the alarm turned it off with our code 10 seconds later and the call center called 32 seconds after that
i would be more than happy to share my internet history to prove this
over the phone we could tell he was genuinely caring about his customers and very accommodating
skyhaven to the rescue
my neighbor started contacting several locksmith companies with no success
well this place people stay for winters months at a time but they have a daily rate of about 45 a night
i have called several times and have left voice messages for david fix the general manager just to check on the status of the claim
this is due to the dishwashers not having water jets on the top
dont make the same mistake i did
oh and ask for polo as your installer
even called to check if we still had warranty coverage with lennox
they dont take visa and when you do try to pay with a debit card they charge you a 50 fee which is ridiculous to me since there arent very many other options
they even removed and replaced the toilet better than it was set before complete with new wax rings so they could snake the drain all the way to the street
when we called back to find out information the delivery company which lowes farms out said they hadnt even received our order
i contacted robert and he came back the next day and replaced the wrong box with the right one
i chose avalos window tinting based on their yelp reviews and product selection
i absolutely  recommend this company
management does not care about residents at all
i felt very confident in knowing that i could trust her to handle every aspect of the transaction with my best interests in mind
the room also had its own bar area and kitchenette
he firmly told us that the new random number was for tonight only
i hope your company has a way to review erics behavior with residents
the staff was very knowledgable and friendly and were up front and honest about what i i was getting and the cost
they came out and looked at what we needed to have done
we noticed within days a major roach problem
i cannot say enough about their customer service and how impressed we were
of course i did not gain knowledge of this until a few months later
by far not even close the worst service i have ever received
i disagree with irwin ks review
fast and very professional
i will definitely be calling them again for any lock trouble
we decided to go with delta versus others especially instead of gb
is there when i call
please save yourself the grief and never use these movers
they installed turf and extended our patio with pavers
heres to all my fellow neighbors cops drug dealers college kids management and all you other working class folks thanks for letting me be a part of this cute little neighborhood
charles was awesome
the photographs that were included help to easily identify and correct any possible problems
put a call into monsoon doors described the problem and raul was able to preliminarily say what the problem was
do yourself a favor and give this guy a call when you need a fast efficient and very friendly locksmith
this company was extremely incompetent
will definitely refer them to anyone who needs their services
matt is a very professional   he was prompt neat and thorough
i had a very good experience with tkscalled and he answered right away and scheduled appointment for the next morning
explain that to your kids
they had no problem giving us a notification for our late fees but cant communicate office hours to their tenants
i had to go to a meeting so i asked her if it was okay to leave her to it and to lock the house on her way outand she said no problem
it was refreshing to see that honest companies still exist
being new to the area shar did a great job showing me the different areas so i could make an informed decision on where i wanted to call home
they showed proficient efficient and affordable cost
i pointed out to her that your company allowed me to change the verbal passcode almost a year ago so why would they do so if i was not a customer
i would never use them again for anything
mike did a great job changing some locks at my business
i called ken lowman of luxury homes of las vegas
this is how i answered my phone
he is not in a rush like other companies that want to finish fast and take your
unfortunately i wont be using this company again and its sad
this one is for my mortgage broker
such a smart way of doing it
kudos to david and company for producing a fabulous product
he basically stole our money
it is pricey but totally worth what you pay for
other shops quoted around 300
i picked apex from these prior reviews
the 3rd guy stated that my ac unit was indeed broken and that he couldnt get anyone to come out till monday to replace the unit
the transformation was amazing
the crew showed up on time and got right to work
there was a problem with a wire harness that needed to be replaced
the pool was plastered and since it was done in winter months the pool wasnt used until recently
worth every penny
owner is not honest and tried to turn a small one pane  150200 replacement into a 1000 job
the office employees are incompitent
they were straightforward and honest in their assessment of what i needed
really good company
its a nice ok apartments and i actually know quite a few people who live here
stay far from this place  we move a week ago from ca to have a better life  when the day finally came for us to move in  they did not have keys  they had weeks to prepare but more to come no mail key was set up  when we finnally enter room the were lots of defect the stove wasnt even hook up  no power coard crack in the window  hole near the door and more
my wife and i recently moved in town after thanksgiving 2015 the guys at bulwark took good care of our things and checked in with us throughout the day
oh and my wheels also look better than ever
i gave southern nevada locksmith a call and they were there within 20 minutes
upon moving in i saw the dream was over
driver said if i didnt want to pay well they would leave my stuff in front of the building and leave well they did
he explained to me what happened and gave me an estimate of 600 bucks
had electrical problem with car  needed tow
i decided i would call around for some other estimates and get back to him and i am so glad i did
i had to bug them to let me talk to the manager so i can say we came in earlier and we were told we had till the 17th to decide
just because there is mold stains on caulking of tub doesnt constitute a full clean charge
there are shady people living here
we were once threatened by a drunk person on the elevator that they would pee on us you cant make this stuff up
they dropped a vintage arcade machine from the height of the truck smashed it well beyond repair 3500 put deep gashes in a wooden headboard about 25 feet long knocked casters off of a kitchen butler and left it propped up so no one would notice until after they left dented my stainless steel refrigerator
we have bought car seats from here more than once and have travelled here all the way from east york to do so
without that  i must suggest that prospective residents should look elsewhere
we have had numerous issues and will continue to have issues costings thousands of dollars each time
she told us that that the kids were supposed to be jumping
she compliments me on being a great longterm customer and suggest that she transfer me to their loyalty department who just might give me some billing concessions
the price stayed the same as quoted too
they have no problem auto charging me every month through my credit card
he had exactly what i needed came while i was at work went on the roof  replaced the part
i found juice cookies chips and fake fruit
3 purchases 1 sale  2 rental properties later jon is our realtor for life
thank you for assisting me on such short notice
i highly recommend trusting them to fix your vehicle
the process for arizona blinds customer service was awful
i had a pretty simple question and i was pleasant on the phone but she was rushing me off
he is very personable and their pricing is extremely competitive
except mount charleston
i had to pay a service trip fee to the company that came out which was money out of my pocket due to the incorrect information provided by aaron pools
colt is very professional attentive and understanding
they suck flat out

i contacted them and the salesman told  be to get a estimate and he would see what he could do
one lady told me to demand a new key because the office staff was reluctant to give her a new one
so someone from this company finally did call me after weeks of total radio silence despite my review and update
they went on long frequent home depot and lunch trips while trying to charge us
not one employee does anything about it
the lack of communication among workers there is very sad

they showed up on time and moved everything two guys and one truck quickly and were very professional
of course they denied this but i guess they just wanted to show they could
vitali rushed over and rekeyed all of the exterior doors and the side gate
its on the inside of the court yard away from where we tell people to park their car to access our building

i could only imagine if i was an already paying customer and had to struggle through two months of lies while trying to get service
just dont move here
i was recommended to jeff  by a coworker
justin was courteous knowledgable and didnt try and over sell
a less honest realtor would have tried to close the deal

i called lou and he was quick and accommodating in every way
dont call you have been warned

i dont know why ar couldnt do the same

dont be surprised if you have to park on the far far end of the apartment community
by far the best plant nursery in the valley
i forgot to take photos before we moved out
they just gave us the keys to a suite that was filled with office boxes and used as a storage house
both the las vegas and henderson offices are family run local businessesand a pleasure to do business with
the service was excellent as well
they are always willing to fix whats needs to be done and do it correctly

the carpet was installed 2 weeks later and it is fabulous
bad bad bad business  they have screwed me over again
i needed an additional fob for my girlfriend rather than her having to use the call box and call my phones and her phone for access
but thats just my opinion based on the way they treat me
how would that be possible unless he started at 1am
he said he wasnt sure but didnt think they could do it quite that soon
but i will not return
i decided to have them unload the shells for me
i told him my mom died
i rarely ever if at all give such effusive praise to any company but this company deserves all the kudos that im going to provide
the setup was remarkably simple
our home is a little under but because she was so meticulous and paid attention to detail she didnt finish the upstairs
the reason why i contacted shapiro  sher is because they are the listing agents for a number of properties why go thru a daisy chain of brokers looking for high commission

cant recommend enough
i am glad that i was able to save hundreds when it was apples to apples
he apologized and stated they were having car problems that as soon as someone is done he will send them to me
he charged 175 for that
they work very hard to take care of issues and make your stay comfortable
i called robert yesterday to request a cleaning in the north west phoenix region just shy of anthem
hank and his crew are awesome
not even 20 minutes later my garage door was up and running again
the only bummer was theyre advertising a 105 special for 3 areas which i did and i had to pay 125  since i guess i booked my service right before that popped up on their yelp page
fantastic food minus 1 star for hair in food and no apology from any staff member and a very mia waitress
i say it is value
compared to any other place ive used  their pricing has to be the most reasonable and definitely the best bang for your buck
we had an extension renovation due to a water leak and dki handled it all
if you need your carpets cleaned i recommend you give rick a shot he is very professional and his pricing was by far the best in las vegas

the outside landscaping is beautiful and well kept

he told us we get everything
he was so polite and even early

the first was a job that was supposed to be done under our home warranty useless things it is but thats a story for another post and the 2nd was to install a new dishwasher
of the two women they sent one penny worked her tail off but the other one kept having to take breaks and just kind of walked around the house pretending to dust things
my home warranty company has refused to replace my unit or give me any cash out on my old unit see my review of platinum home warranty
we bought a house about 4 months ago and inherited some pretty bad taste
i love love love flora couture
i hope to find a company that understands they have a commitment to their customers
they cleaned up their mess and took all the branches and leaves with them
i told steve i would be available for referrals and gave him pictures of the rooms with the new wood
i called and the owner said they had never paid a claim in 7 years and he denied the cleaners took it
quality service and craftsmanship
to top it off their price was much less than 3 other companies we received quotes from
i guess my next action is to contact the bbb
after calling to complain about several things including the up charge i was told that they did not need complaining customers and to not contact them again
this is the second time we have been treated badly by the people in that department
he did it within a couple of days
i had eric install cabinets and a peg board in my garage
i have found my lifetime plumbing company and will never call anyone else
he told me though that my truck wouldnt sit untouched for that hour they would start removing the old tint so that it would be ready for the new tint as soon as they finished the other vehicle

thank you get your move on
i could not believe the luxury i was surrounded by
great service will bring us back and we will definitely ask for doc
its a year later and the heating and ac work great
the service was exceptional
when i moved in they had said at first that the appliances would be new and on my first day of moving in the fridge and the stove were old and filthy
they actually do remove your door panels to apply the tint to all parts of your glass which adds to its look and feel after installation
their emails are rude and unprofessional
this company was wonderful
the lady who answered the phone was super friendly and helpful
they were on time and stretch the carpet in 1 room cleaned 3 rooms in 1 hr
i ended up going for an extremely high end and reliable tankless water heater that is energy star compliant
i had to leave work to let them in to take photos spend time on the phone with them and my house never got cleaned the day they came
they were honest dependable and all with a happy face
for the precise reasons i love residence inns this room delivered
i would recommend cory and jose all day but not super happy with the management company
he could have very easily charged me full price as he was there for more than 30 minutes
came here to find some new moulding for the house and they have tons of choices
i dont have a problem using the stairs but it really made me nervous to ride the elevator since it broke so often
on the second appt they kept me waiting for 5 hours and then never showed
i requested a quote and the operations manager brock came onsite and provided me with a quote within the hour
damien was great to work with
his work is professional courteous and unbelievably handsome
the first time going there and scoping it out the owner was very nice and informative
so far the sensors are working fine and i appreciate a business man who treats his customers with respect and fairnessnice going quinn
dont stay here
he solved both problems in relatively short time
we have done several moves with various companies and i would hands down use zippyshell for my next move
well it took 2 weeks but that was okay because there were some cement works to be done and its a big yard with few tree trunks to be taken out and etc
staff was very friendly and helped me out of a jam
may god continue to bless you and your family with many more gifts for the new year
i rated this onestar because you cannot rate it zero
at the conclusion of the work they asked me if i were satisfied with the work done
so i decided to purchase flooring from lumber liquidators and im very satisfied with my floors and installation
very professional  dealt with it very nicely i was pretty short of time but he did extra fittings to make it quick  fixed the problem
they do an amazing job and pay attention to detail
if you opted to select one of the upstairs apartments you wont even miss out on there being no fitness room or center here because the stairs are super steep
we recommend him for anyone who wants quality painting services
staff 3 stars they are not rude but they need to improve the way they address tenant needs
would you like to wait while i pull up the stats on that
we just purchased 5 windows from kj and we are extremely happy with the quality of the window
they honored the yelp special of no trip charge and 10 off as well
this manager decides to go off on my boyfriend totally out of the blue and i quote from him she walks over and starts asking me who do you think you are fucking insulting my employee he tells me that again he repeats himself stating it wasnt meant to be an insult and he was cussing to himself
she caused a scene and tried to humiliate me
must be a scam
their technician nick showed up and went above and beyond making sure the system worked properly before he left
it was supposed to be the great thing buying your own first house  they had ruin the whole thing
three days prior to my move i had not heard from them so i called for a time it took them nearly 510 minutes to find my invoice in the computer despite me providing them my name phone number and my invoice number
im no plumber but it doesnt take an expert to know when youve been taken
the bark park is super cute and convenient for those with dogs
i never had any problems the first time around
rob has been my husband and is realtor since our first home purchase in 2003 now we are on our third upgrade and hes has never steered us wrong

my wife called and i talked to this gentleman on the phone
ive barely in my place for 2 weeks and have had all sorts of problems
first she tells me that we are not on list for today
bitch i just want the truth and to know what is going on apparently they dont want my money
she managed our property as a rental and then handled the sale of the home for us and a complicated transaction
i have been an att wireless customer since they bought out my old phone company cingulair wireless
once again it was a great experience
this project included matching and extending an existing paver walkway and the day after we signed the agreement doug called to ask my wife if we happened to have any info on the style  color of the existing pavers
i called the dealership to ask them how to get rid of this feature and they told me that i would need a second key which we lost right after buying the vehicle and new reprogramming at a cost of around 20000
they were very understanding when i got myself into a bind and have been very helpful in any inquiries i have
i do believe that marty and his team is all about protection and customer service vs other places
give me a break on we are trying to give you the best service bull
since he came out right away the leak was fixed early enough that it didnt do a bunch of damage
but you can get them online cheaper
my ac didnt come oncalled a different company
gene was the tech that came out
i am rarely around during the day so i cant comment on the noise level then but overall great
in addition the guys were sloppy forgot two of my items and slightly damaged my front door of the apartment i was renting
it wasnt until speaking to the property owner that i was able to get it handled
lol i find it ridiculous that people actually leave bad reviews
i highly recommend leisure time pool service and al
couple that with 2 so we are now at 27000 plus tax   i dont mind people making a profit heck if he wanted to charge 40 that would be been better but 135
nice to have the same lady each time
the office staff smiles through their teeth they like you till it doesnt get them anywhere
it started to get close to the day i had requested installation and i had no confirmation that they would come
this place was so delicious from the salad to the desert
we had off white carpets which are a pain to clean with a few stains
the new ownership inherited these problems from the past owners and did not have to follow up on them but they did with work well done
i would use this company again affordable quick friendly and proffessional
the office staff are not personable at all
he reinforced my door and changed my roller wheels
i have used fountain hills ac for a few years now and they always provide superior service
i paid for the installation of an outdoor carpet for my front porch
the loading is not careful at all they even dont care about labels on the boxes like glass or paintings or fragile
zack figures it out and asks for the 45 fee
great customer service
they were always very thorough and patient when responding to our questions
then he tells me i have to pay the rest of the 1900 before they start
i would absolutely use queen of maids again
thank you rmr cc corporate cox corporation
im happy about it
i read other reviews before making the decision to use or not use hawaiian pools
not how one should run a business
i understand being short staffed
rob gave me a great quote and stuck to it which unfortunately many service businesses dont anymore
leaving us unable to open the garage door and get both cars out
he also takes the time to answer any questions i have
over and over again tomorrow but tomorrow never comes
when i received my bill i was billed for keys not being returned trash removal full clean pet seal on carpet and full paint
i did have a problem with one of the power cords that came with the new sound bar but joe replaces within a couple of days
now i still do need to see if verzion is going to stink me again i was told that it would only add 32 per month to my bill  thats it so we will see
very professional team and i would definitely use them for my personal move in two months
this place is the best
then he drops the big one yeah were a little more expensive than other places its going to be 125
i cant thank them enough for making my move virtually free of stress
they use the cheapest parts they can find and the cheapest vendors
i will definitely be calling reeis every year for my ac maintenance
the installers show up on time finish on time nothing to complaint about the experience was great
they really do go above and beyond
one of the staff members in the office was rude and horrible
ill give em some props for that
he knew our tile layercontractor and was able to give us his discount
i will always be a customer and i highly recommed dc tint for all of your tinting needs
levi responded promptly to my request
five star service
you can get on a maintenance schedule with them for service every month or 2nd 3rd or 4th months and they offer an awesome discount for repeat customers
i wish i could give this 0 stars
it is not easy to admit you might have a dirty home
while this may not be the most reviewed tiny shop in vegas it is definitely the most personal
if ace down the road doesnt have what im looking for pretty good chance lowes does
its so bad and the treatments arent working its no longer safe for me to be there next the staff isnt terrible but they arent as helpful as they should be i just started dealing with cooperate instead and then things get handled
ill never use these clowns again
she tried getting this in writing before moving out with multiple emails and letters but he would never reply he would always call and confirm on the phone
the technician justin was on time and very nice
nonetheless i got another invoice that was even higher than the highend estimate
kenia maria and lulu were very professional and thorough
saw southwestern home design and remodeling at a home show and talked to them
you even asked me to research the part and provide you a part number to make it easier for you
contacted peter about 2 months ago to work on my truck and i was pleased
super nice guy i certainly hope our experience was an anomaly but buyer beware
i contacted jc and the issue was taken care of immediately
the tech said he needed to call to get authorization to charge me 349 for a total cleaning of my duct work
needless to say this whole trip was a waste of time
so on season premier of dexter we complain and they switched it that night at no charge or delay time so we caught the 2nd showing
first time i came here i was acknowledged
koby answered the phone and came within 30 minutes
so i cant wait to see what they offer when i return
called customer services informed us they dont have the door in stock but will have it when we need it which was over the weekendon fathers day and they still came out
i felt he respected my time
i called paul and asked id he could come by and take a look as it could be any one of a myriad of issues
with only a few questions he determined that the problem was caused by a broom that was blocking one of the sensors
do some yelp research this place came out made a ridiculously high quote 1000 for a spring repair and when i said i was getting a second quote charged got really snippy and said he was charging me a 50 service fee the opposite of what i was told of by their call center actually based in nv
today i retuned to purchase an additional piece in the set
im sorry these other people had issues but its not an accurate picture of shannon day realty
thanks for your great service
dont waste your money or your sanity
if it werent for your incredible wireless service everywhere id have paid the early cancellation and driven to att
accepts credit cards
we are so grateful to them and we highly recommend them to anyone with moving needs
this was an amazing experience
just moved from kona hawaii to oregon
3rd time using them
while breakins can happen anywhere a security gate minimizes this risk
i left that house in better shape than when i moved in even hiring a professional maid to clean it top to bottom and leaving behind the 2 garage door openers that i bought out of own pocket about 50 after they refused to give me one yet they still somehow found a way to claim that i somehow damaged the house and kept some of my deposit
and right now we are still dealing with the most disgusting problem which is the roach infestation  every type of roach from smallest to biggest and different colors  inside and outside my apartment and also around every building
our nanny maria kept our daughter entertained entire 4 hrs without even turning on tv
so i called the next day cuz i was out of the country and she said sorry ill go check on it now i forgot and called me three hours later
my tank leaked and i fixed that
he spent over 45 minutes reviewing my dispute details and was very honest in his assessment
they assured me pest control had taken care of it as the gentleman was there that day he assured me too
their products and installation is the best and professionally accomplished
she truly went above and beyond for us and there is nowhere else we would even consider going for any additional flooring
cleaning authority was always good about taking responsibility and fixing what they broke until the last item which cost hundreds of dollars to replace
everything about our experience was 5 stars
what a great community to live in
on december 17th we received a letter from ms roberts confirming that the property had been rented out for january and february 2015 so that the property was now going to be occupied by a tenant
i wanted to give them my business but looks like they didnt want it
the fuel valve was clogged with crystallized gas
larry from element design  landscape responded promptly to our first call
im chosen to break my lease because i cant keep paying this high gas bill and rent especially when their not trying to assist with this issue
the carpet is great quality and feels amazing on our feet
we discussed the pools chemistry and he added some chemicals to clear it up
weve never experienced any issues
they have no customer service and my friends shoes are not fixed
they are always prompt to notify us about about issues and are consistent with schedule
not only were they 10 minutes early but they were professional quick and they also put together my table and bed
this is thr absolute worst apartment management and complex i have ever   lived in
i recently had an issue with shower faucets so my home warranty company dispatched nick jr who was amazing in helping me not only with my faucets in a timely and very professional manner but took the time to check other plumbing issues and convinced me to have a water conditioner installed
i like this place and have been going here for years but do have one complaint
it hasnt even been a year yet and most of our plants in our yard are dying or dead
i would rather have my garage flooded then ever have to work with this company again
their solution was to put sand bags in our back yard after the 5th6th flood and their efforts at a drainage solution were late at best
do not let her smooth talking get you
the new manager whom i spoke to today says hes been at this location a couple months
i highly recommend using adolfo from this company
you can get much more than 600 square feet for 1200 dollars in other parts of town
lucas came out and looked at it and took care of it immediately
they not only commented on how delicious the food tasted and how well it was prepared but they also had numerous compliments on the staff and the outstanding service
sandy knows the area and the market very well and provided a ton of good advice in terms of location pricing and all the tradeoffs of various homes
checked the unit confirmed the price and made arrangements for the next day
this is my 3rd month at elan  i overlook the pool and you are terribly mistaken
they literally sparkle
att honored this weeks special without any rigmarole
there is a lighted lounge area outside my room with bbq grilles and shuffleboard courts
3 rivers report ripped apart the house and gave detailed info and pictures of everything that was wrong with the house
they were very professional personable and treated my belongings with respect
unprofessional and rude
someone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens
i had an old squeeky garage door and i called several garage door repair companies to get the best price on a complete replacement
he stopped by the same day to look at the job
but she literally gave me so many options in finding a home for me  my son
he sent me to his preferred lender who was either an idiot or a conartist
the total time at my house was 20 minutes
and do them all well
i told him what i needed and he got it done
they kept us informed every step of the way with frequent emails if we had a question and called we where never told he is busy or out of the office someone had an answer immediately
because i personally cant imagine how you would even attempt to justify such incompetent work and poor business practices
prompt and extremely professional service
lack of hot water heaters old water heaters lack of attention and basic care for tenants may be to blame for this but it seems a little interesting to say the least that for over the 3  12 years living there the problem only seemed to get worse and never better
the installation guys were great and very hardworking
we are very happy that he was the one to come and fix the problem in the nick of time before we had hot temperatures hit
but we have had 2 sometimes 3 devices watching video in here and it has been hd and fast
how lucky you are to have veronica on your staff
next day appointment to repair a gfi short in my residence
phone budget was 50 and they made a 3 minute job and charged 200
this business is unprofessional and amy h documents this unprofessionalism here on yelp for all to see
i cant say enough good things about this company
after closing on a house its great to get my clients inspired for how to really make their new house their own and again the employees really know what theyre doing
the crew was on time and did a great job cleaning the carpets
they were fast thorough and very polite
i would definitely use them again
additionally their own handyman told me that the strong gas smell was not a problem
the staff member working on my lease told me a series of lies and bargains failed to give me a complete copy of my lease and have continued to drop the ball whenever maintenance is needed on my apartment ie
priority appliance was assigned to fix our dishwasher by our home warranty company
will never look elsewhere for tint
a very grateful client
i took my daughter for senior pictures the photographer was great so were the pictures
it was a pleasure watching him work
i would not hesitate to call them again for any of my plumbing needs
our worst moving experience ever
previously their color consultant helped me coordinate colors for the interior and exterior of my new home
cannot wait for my contract to be over
luckily i wasnt the one looking to use this company to rent from but my son was
we are very happy with our pulte home
which was a lie because they had used it a day or two prior to that
recently i hired them to do my lawn maintenance and they do a perfect job each time
oh  the workout equipment is dated
i was told no so i called the office
cost 10 including two new keys
of course i had signed the bid in advance so it was on me
in 2008 i used them for about a year
