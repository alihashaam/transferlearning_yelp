the service was very good  prompt cheerful and smiling
we got seated and had to wait quite awhile for our  order to be taken
she never came back with our change and i wasnt leaving her a 30 dollar tip for that service so i went back in to find out what happened and she had actually never even taken our bill again
dinner 1green salads very large portions with a light vinagrette 2select stone crab 6 pieces not recommended yet it comes pre cracked and easy to eat but you can tell it is frozen
serving sizes were very large
food  i got the chicken gorgonzola salad with pine nuts  terrific
i can always tell how good staff is when the manager comes and speaks to me personally about my allergies and to make sure i can eat what i want to order
the couple at our table got panko sesame chicken strips with thai dipping sauce 11 and certified angus beef strip loin with shallot tomato and garlic mash potato 28
the food is good but often the service has been on the slow side  seems too few waitpersons for the number of tables
plus you get a big dill pickle
rather than brave the rush hour traffic we eat out near the airport and this is the place we more often than not go
fast and friendly service toonot the best in the world but its better than most
if you like great food a place where the owner and his family are hands on and a perfect place for relaxing date night then look no further
seafood lovers  get here now
i judge pancakes on one simple thing are they delicious when eaten with just butter
all i can say is freshness is key
i have had the lo mein the fried rice the mu shu pork and the pot stickers and all are excellent  the mu shu is simply to die for
the chef came out and offered a wonderful appetizer on the house
the quiche with bacon was okay
of course many were like buffet
pretty disappointed in their blt sandwich especially for a restaurant that specializes is bacon
the food was excellent and ivan the waiter worked his butt off for our party of 12 but tammie was a real bitch to customers
yes  i see posts about the waiters and waitresses not speaking good english
that is huge when it comes to mexican food
they validate parking whisk you to the theater in a complimentary limo or private car make sure you tip
staff at the bar just looked at us but didnt point us to the podium in the center of the restaurant or acknowledge us
like really expensive
they dont do fusion
the restaurant was packed and it looked like we were coming in toward the end of a busy lunch rush
its a really nice place right next door to shakespeares a trendy bar
check your order before you leave with take out they got the soup right but the spring rolls wrongif there is anything i cant stand its an order fucked up by someone when i physically point to it in the menu
i would not recommend this place at all
the food is excellent for the phoenix area and almost as good as it is in new york and san fran
i think  it is more like a traditional miso ramen noodle from sapporo
those with chive will be differentiated with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds on top
i had a bite of everyones food and shakes and will just say that if the food we ordered tasted was that amazing i can only imagine what the rest of the menu tastes like
happiness is dinner at ferraros and ask for eric for your server
i can not say it is the best but they are really good and decent priced
excellent food with great service
you can never go wrong here
it was around 5pm on a wednesday and i was surprised at the number of people walking in
its hard to screw up a satay beef with instant noodle
such a great bakery of the cuff of uptown
ive worked in the restaurant business for nearly 20 years and i was impressed attn manager great promotion decision
for where it is and what it is this is as good as it gets
i ordered an old world burger
their breakfast lunch and dinner menus feature a variety of food that are prepared with the utmost of care
the staff are always friendly and get to know their customers
if you are going on a holiday its probably a good idea to go early
ordered the mac and cheese with fried chicken
die sosse und die geschmlzten zwiebeln beschreib ich mal mit unterer durchschnitt
i like coming here for weekday lunch
awesome locals spot to watch any game or fight in vegas
but if you want to take the time to go out and buy a cold juice press then buy all the individual ingredients and take the time to juice it yourself go right ahead
jtais aussi tent par lide de manger un schnitzel
the steaks had that perfect char taste
mac and cheesekraft makes better
the waitress was so aloof and didnt even notice that we were dissatisfied when we told her not to box up this dish
completely average food prices and atmosphere
wish i lived here so i could come all the time
the server took our drink orders and went on his wayno greeting no small talk and no mention of their specials
everyone recognizes he gordon biersch award winning garlic fries
and if youre thinking about eating here before 230 pm on a weekday youre exponentially better off grabbing the 10 lunch special at wasabi
i tried the mamas trio which was extremely disappointing
the toppings also  tasted super freshnot like they were out of a can
today the truck stopped at our office which is always a treat
not very memorable in taste or quality
jack beagles is my go to in noda
convenient if you live or pass nearby but not really worth going out of the way for
azzeria is more than just pizza
overall ok but not my favourite
i go to flannys on a fairly regular basis as its close to home  always  maintains a better than average craft beer selection
as you might imagine the food was only mediocre and the service poor
one of the specials that stood out veal saltimbocca had a very good combination of flavors and texture
we started with docg
ill start off with that the pie actually pretty good
first off their menu is highly incorrect
asked for chicken pho soup with white meat got dark meat and over cooked spongy pieces of white  plus some surprise tripe pieces gross
the service was ok but nothing special and the place is really loud and crowded  def dont go there for a romantic dinner but kind of a cool spot for big group with a big wallet
it wasnt bad but it wasnt the best in town
a box of their artistic works not only look delightful they taste delicious
when our server came he was really attentive
even after the 5 minute ride home they were still crispy and drenched in hot sauce like they should be
the panini version is just as good but was on ciabatta this time not sure if thats a new thing or the usual
i like a little fat on my steak
my husband was thrilled that they got al dente right when he had a bite
it kept my toddler entertained while we waited for our food and during dinner making this place a must for future trips to vegas
we were a table of 4 older folks
for the price we paid we will continue to just eat at our lunch cafeteria
overall very good food
hmm i would say be careful
when you return they remember you even if its a couple of weeks later
service is pretty good too
four people randomly attended to us until our appetizers showed up and then charles came over and said he would be our server
i always order the angus beef you cannot go wrong with that
service is a bit strange  but its traditional chinese service
i recognized a large piece from a local artist and i am sure most of the other pieces are probably local as well
one was a california roll the other was a philly roll
service is not the best
with so many other places to play i would look around before coming back
its not really big
also kitchen and restaurant were very noisey
location was easily accessible with plenty of parking
this is my go to lunch spot
some are wearing all black a few others are roaming about in a tank top with their tits hanging out
but i am not in a hurry so i will sit back relax  enjoy
i would review their other dishes but i just cant help ordering bun bo hue every time i go
we had such a good night at the blackbird i am anxious to go back
we went once and i will never understand the attraction of the place
i think in the future they would benefit greatly by adding a coconut soft serve onto their menu
one can order the signature dish of either chicken beef the combo which is chicken beef  shrimp  or the seafood combo which has shrimp  octopus
their curry is really spicy even at level 0
my husband got the fried tomato blt
well this is the usaso it was excellent
the food was pretty good and we didnt wait a long time to get our order
all around great new restaurant and staff is super nice
i ordered my pizza and 3 minutes later was eating a very delicious perfectly prepared pizza
ive been here many times and each time the food is consistently delicious
i was probably a second away from kicking his a
my pancreas is screaming at me
other than that this place has the best chinese food
as a side note your reasturant has a great idea for ordering via the tablet
this restaurant is located where three others havent lasted
who does that
my feet froze and we all ended up giving in before the 45 minute timeline
compared to the airport peers symons is better
le jeudi les dames reoivent 2 verres gratuits  lachat de 10 minimum en nourriture puis de 5  7 les cocktails fruits sont moiti prix donc seulement 5
los reyes de la tortaabsolutely the kings of the torta
i will say it was tasty but it wasnt anything fabulous for the high prices
took over an hour and a half for delivery and the food was just not good
im not a whiskey fan but enjoyed it
my favorites are chicken gizzards chicken hearts and liver because not many places serve those in vegas
for dessert i had the creme brulee which was also very delicious
the 3 pieces of broccoli that were on the side of the plate were also cold
service was amazing as well the staff and management were quick on the drink refills and the attention was well timed yet not too much a hard balance to strike
so i dont usually complain but this place is unbelievable
and the dishes we got were divinely yummy
loved the service and the ambiance and the delicious cornichons for the table
the sides there are a must  get as many as your stomach can handle
both appetizers came with delicious dipping sauces
but not special
i love visiting cavecreekcarfree and was pleased to hear that there was a new restaurant to try
thank you to you both
i am not one to criticize on these things but this kind of made me irritated
gord ordered bacon mac  cheese  he said it was delicious and would get it again
empty dirty run down in ghetto industrial area
we were told that if one person orders the tasting menu everyone at the table has to order the tasting menu no matter how many people are in the party so that the kitchen could get the timing of the plates right
this is a really great restaurant and i hope more people will learn about it and give it a try
she just avoided us the entire time
i thought it was good but wasnt blown away
now back to the slice
if you dont care and you dont try you should get nothing
however given the quality of the wings or lack thereof i dont have particularly high hopes
if you are in montreal make sure you at least go there and treat yourself to an amazing tuna poke bowl
the entire meal was a disappointment
they always have a special of some sort worth trying
my chicken strips and fries came out nice and hot which i liked but still the lack of taste made me wish i just went to mcdonalds to eat
it was 3am
lamb rogan josh  nice deep flavour
like the sauce not to bad
thai mango salad  this was my least favourite of what we ordered
i noticed that the majority of tables were set up to sit two people comfortably
first thing i noticed the music
every time i visit vegas i try to eat here
we will be back soon for breakfast
on weekends however its another story
alisha the waitress is the best
bones were brittle  actually broke apart when given little effort
they tasted like nothing i had before
in each room youll find separate seating consisting of hodgepodge furniture
after that i pulled up to the window and paid for my food
if you want to meet friends for drinks at a pretty chill place this would work
if i could recommend anything it would be their chili  it is fantastic
my wife and i both ordered a 10oz rare cut it was cooked perfectly rare but tipped the scales well over 10oz a nice treat
the only thing that was good at this buffet was the grilled stuff
anything for breakfast is great but their breakfast sandwiches and coffee are incredible
my wifes eggplant and tofu dish was great too
their beer selection was a nice selection of craft with most beers in the 6 to 8 range
as soon as i bit into my burger i understood why i always hear people talking about burgatory
we found this place on yelp
the chefs do not attempt to ask you what you would like
the staff was fantastic
our expectations were low going in but our hopes were very high
their food and service is beyond good
my date had a rice pilaf with asparagus and roasted tomato that had a rich luscious taste
ive seen it lined up 8 cars at sunday 8 am and also thursday 9 pm
there are many great options on the menu the food is fresh and tasty and the presentation is good
huge menu something for everybody here
i dont ask for over the top service but i do expect service as you would every table
i walked in with my certified service dog and not only was i refused service i was also cussed at and called derogatory names by the owner himself
as it is i think id like to go again to try that lobster pot pie and a number of other appetizers
however the bill came and we were charged for the extra pancake that we never ordered and were told to keep
i had their calzone before and it was pretty good but i preferred the stromboli
i saw other table with 2 people ordered the toast tower none of them could finish it
but my recommendation definitely is to give this place a try
excelente vista y buena comida mexicana vale la pena esperar para disfrutar de la comida ta que siempre esta lleno
not a lot to say other than the service was good and the food was excellent
we sampled several seafood dishes all cooked to perfection with imaginative combinations of ingredients and seasonings
that says a lot
ask for jimmyhes a kick
it was nice and cheesy with a wellseasoned crust although i feel like it couldve had more of the toppings
im so annoyed that i deleted my photos off my phone
place is really small
the reason being i think i posted my first draft in a scottsdale douchey tone that is not my style
i began to ask her for her corporate office phone number because i didnt appreciate her yelling at me and she said that pizza hut doesnt have a corporate office so i asked her for her managers info and she told me that his name was josh and that he was the general manager
it has a fun kitchy vibe
we were definitely stuffed and couldnt even finish our food
now its our favorite japanese restaurant and we bring everyone here
i wouldnt recommend dining here for lunch or dinner but definitely stumble in here after a night of drinking if youve got the munchies
the owners came around and spoke with us
lastly just order what you want for the meal and if you want extra order it separately as takeout to avoid having a padded bill
updated  still love this place
it had an awkward taste and it was just bad
very pricey for a steak house
breakfast is hot fast and always what you were expecting
we all felt very satisfied with our meals
the pizzas are huge and very tasty
i loved the decor and it was a great space
the inept hospitality and speed of there staff is mind boggling
unlike most sushi restaurants in america the chefs prepare the fish for nigiri sushisashimi thin and tender
i never believed there was such a thing until i had a bite of their chocolate lava cake
i love how the menu is always different
cons registering as a member took a long time but you only have to register once
no spice  kick what so ever
try the rancher sirloin with the bacons sunny side egg and hollandaise
show up about 20 minutes after it opens
veal was okay and the salmon with crispy skin would have been good had it not been of the overly sour tomato sauce and overabundance of capers or whatever those were
its the quality ingredients that set them aparti just wish they broke away from their routine and were more creative with their flavors
of buffets ive never been to anything worse old country buffet or ocb for those who have frequented there as children could run circles around this place if these buffets were running some kind of circular track race
the french fries that come with the sandwich are absolutely excellent  among the best in a long time for me  they are fresh cut
the first drink i ordered was the el diablo it had tequila and ginger beer in it it was good
we opted for outside even though there was a little bit of a wait
they gave us no spoons took way too long to bring the viddles i received a tiny cup of tartar sauce for my fish and the prices were too high
it was super late at night and we were looking for another mexican restaurant
our shrimp was great
i have to admit i didnt eat there not because i didnt try i arrived at 910 on a thursday morning 102314
super super super friendly staff a great atmosphere and veryyyyy delicious teas and coffee
i do recommend calling ahead which i almost always do
solid use of premium toppings nothing overboard that leaves you with a gut bomb but rather the perfect blend of hand grated cheese great meats pep meatball sausages and really good veggies
dont think we will return though as the food just isnt done right
worth visiting if not frequenting
and hmmmm hmmm was it good
and seafood dishes that include a fantastically prepared gingercrusted salmon they do have something for everybody
i can honestly say even on days we dine there and mark is not there the waiters waitresses services bartenders all have treated us very well
i did not care for it because it did not have any vegetables just tempeh and sauce with rice
but clean the food came at good temperature and quite tasty
the cocktails are excellent
service was great
very good and very filling
chips and salsa were great
salad dressing was good though
i was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders
i suffer through the horrible service for the awesome cheap wings
plenty of items to choose from also
we tried the chicken pot pie bites
and a smooth noncanned gravy
if you dont have certain cuts of chicken please dont lie to your customers and charge them extra
i have plenty to say about the monstrous space  long trek to the room
there wasnt much of a line and the wait wasnt too long either
employees are always very nice at both locations
however the portions for the price arent very reasonable compared to other burger joints in the burgh
im so happy sorelle exists
the flavors were seriously delicious
service intelligence level and food
we thought the pork belly bites beet salad and meat and cheese platters were good
but it was great with extra mustard to add flavour
portions were a little skimpy for the price
their weekend brunch can be quite tasty and their candied yams are incredible
and i know its deep friedbut damnthe little napkin they put in the bottom of your to go box was all translucent from soaking up the oil
if you have a large party try and book the private room
this place isnt what it is all hyped up to be
it was exactly what youd expect from a diner
both were grilled to perfection came with a nice sized side of rice and vegetables
the price was better than i expected for dinner on the strip in las vegas
all at our table enjoyed their meal
practice your best chinese restaurant vigorous arm waving to get attention
this was really good food at a very descent price
service was prompt and attentive though
their employees were nice and courteous
cheap  and nicely done overall
i arrived to an empty restaurant italy was playing in the euro cup shortly and to my surprise they were actually super friendly in person
i have been to italian oven twice both times including my kids
the order was missing one addition kabob and they made it right by adding another kabob in addition to the one they brought out later
its right they do well but over years their quality of food and service has reduced significantly
low light red romantic decor
just turned 21 a few days before
so get on over to sammys and have yourself a fun culinary tour of the world
if i lived out west id be eating here on a regular basis
never tried anything else except a few bites of my boyfriends choice hamburger
used the mobile app on my way to the reaturaunt and my order was ready for pick up as soon as i stepped in
the sauce for the adriatico pasta plate was not pleasant in flavor or appearance
i couldnt get enough
theyve also got a huge selection of indian desserts in all sorts of bright colours and the ones that ive been daring enough to try have been delicious
the tortillas were sooo thin and soft and buttery
they use melissas produce company so all of the vegetables are of high quality and super fresh
lunch time decisions are hard
good prices and friendly service
never disappointed when i come here and i eat here everytime im in vegas
i was skeptical because of all the mixed reviews but overall we had a good experience
four star solid
i saw a roach near the vietnamese noodle section and let the cook know but she just killed it in front of me without an apology
i started the night out by having high expectations because of all the great things my friends told me about guu but they were blown out of the roof when i finished my meal
courteous staff and quick service
i would recommend this cafe
get the junior size unless you plan on sharing
but a good compliment to the steak pecan pie  first off i like pecna emerils banana cream pie  this was good one of the better banana cream pie i had but the pecan pie was just too good that this just tasted alright
the food was exactly what i hoped for fresh and flavorful
i keep coming back
the chips were a little greasy but were still good
for more loungy feel i wonder if it would be best to go when they open or at the tail end of brunch
been here for a few times and every time was a bit disappointing
i did get the japanese fried chicken appt good gosh i could not bite into in the chicken
the iced oatmeal cookie was enormous and delicious
if you are new to mediterranean cuisine i recommend asking anna the server
beauty supplies vitamins and supplements iodized water groceries pet items
im really pissed off
ill give a two on five just because of the local craft beers list
ive never had a problem at ahsos
warning when you order from the website menu verify the prices or show up expecting to pay for more than you bargained for
the staff was so friendly
service with a smile and also entertaining to talk to
all specials and pork chop were 86d so i tried what appeared to be 17 chicken marsala very poor choice
the main dish was crunchy fried rice charred tofu steak with veggies and presented like a 5 star restaurant
we are both big critics of pho so we were quite pleased with the broth quality
i hope they dont very enlarge this placeit would so spoil it
my wife had a margherita pizza and i had a calzone
decided to order my food online and pick it up at the counter but guess what
my fav is the dole pineapple whip heaven in a cup or cone
on a positive note the service was fast considering it was a full house
verdict  i am not a big fan of this place but it really isnt a bad place either
its kind of small but i never have had trouble finding a seat
simple ingredients but so good
after calling to make a change we learned that our reservation for 24 was nonexistent
i shouldve tried dinner
they cook their pizza with some type of garlic in their sauce or something so garlic lovers you will love this place
very solid beer selection and the food is ok  however why i bump them up a star is because they donated pizza after my sons basketball league was over
i liked the different options offered here and would definitely try the gouda cheese sticks next
terrible experience from the owner
awful service cold food ordinary taste and disregard for hygiene
love this canes
the pizza is decent a little overpriced if you ask me and a nice environment
their food and service is great even though they were slammed
the service was professionally trained to culinary standards  not something you get very often anymore
did not leave a greasy taste in my mouth
we need to import more new mexico restauranteers
i tried a bite it seemed like a gfs frozen patty to accompany his gfs french fries
if you want a truly good buffet try the bachanal at caesars palace
we all loved the food
so moving on and at this point they are 0 for 2 next up was the soup in the glass cup which again was nothing to brag about
my family and i go here when breakfast outside seem suitable during busy days running errands
as a family traveling with 2 kids 16 and 12 we were nervous that it appeared to be a dark bar however it was just fine
other than that this was a great restaurant and a great experience and i will always consider for lunch and would like to try for dinners also going forward
well instead of providing this simple explanation our bartender informed us that he didnt have all the ingredients and that we would have to go downstairs to the lingling bar in order to order a hakka
first come first serve
anyways the food here is actually really good
they are just not the same the food is different
the beef chunks were yummy but a little tough if you have trouble chewing though that didnt stop me since it does taste good
they put these paper hats on you with phrases
what an explosion of goodness with every bite
we almost fought for each bite of this one
when the bill arrived we were charged with 5 drinks
the atmosphere is definitely a little uppity but more than anything i would say classy and modern with white black and red decor
4 pumpkin and corn congee  once in awhile its good to eat something healthy
it was a tasty three bites but i would rather pay a little more for a more substantial portion of food
one of the few buffets ive been to where theres a huge selection to choose from and everything is delicious
great appetizers as well as entrees
they have fresh juice smoothies vegan options and waffles
it had been at least a good half hour since we got our pizza and it was still relatively hot when we opened the box ive definitely had better pizza
i had vegetable fajitas with shrimp added which put mine around 15
weve also had an event here which went off perfectly
conveniently located in town square on las vegas blvd
i had the fish tacos haddock special which came with homemade coleslaw delicious 1600
her tone of voice was extremely coarse and unprofessional
so now ill share with you the horrible sandwiches we had
i had their oysters rockefeller and jon and sara had the scampi and a spread if some sort that was delicious
i had the pesto pasta which was really tasty and the budino for dessert which was delicious
i settled on the the rosarito which consisted of chorizo egg guacamole and jack cheese
the pho and appetizers were delicious and we received great service
considering i had wings and strips i think i will save my money and go somewehre else next time
makes a pretty good sports bar with a large number of the at many angles so you can always see a game going
i eat here once a week
we ordered a slice of white pizza to share and some beer
considering the fried nature of it
my colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way
prices are great too
when i received the chicken sandwich i had a very mixed opinion of it mostly negative
sometimes i order brown rice to substitute and it is great
each mouthful makes you wonder what drunken festivities led to such a wonderful combination
i dont know why i ordered it  probably the martinis fault
i highly do not recommend this place
we were then told that would be a 45min wait
after waiting about 1015 minutes i asked what was taking so long
its just authentic high quality japanese food
great for weekend brunch with family and friends
if you are looking for an ok slightly expensive for what you are getting meal where you can oggle waiters this is the place for you
my meatloaf was disgusting
in the meantime the attendees enjoy some excellent soup bread and music
bbq duck tostones 950 these are really tasty but damn that price for only 3
shout out to lauren for best attitude and customer service
all in all i would recommend people to not at all waste their money on the food here
the mash had a nice smokey taste and the gravy was quite savory
main we got    pei mussels white wine parsley preserved lemon french fries
my only complaint is that it took such a long time for our food to come out
went here other night for my birthday
i must mention the special sauce again i think it was raspberry vinaigrette and honey mustard i may be missing one ingredient but not too far off
if i could import one restaurant from las vegas to denver id have a hard time deciding between this and osis kitchen
you have to come here at least once while being in vegas
mind you at this point there were several empty tables and the restaurant was not as busy as ive experienced before
in short i recommend
kabuto was just okay though
our server is the same sweet girl we have every time and i believe it must be the owners daughter
this was our first time dining in and we loved everything
we had an order of lumpia shanghai too
i really liked the burger
i took it to go
i think if i go back i would do a freshness test before i start gobbling down the food
we finished off the meal with some ice cream which tasted like those little clear cups with the strawberry stripes along the side
ive also tried their coconut shrimp which were cooked nicely and were not too thickly battered
how can you make bacon bland
and if youre free on a weekdays go take advantage of the lunch buffet cus it is an awesome bang for the buck
celebrating two birthdays
overall the service was good and food was above decent
what do you know about poutine
dont know what that was about kind of chalky
alchemy has easily become one of my favorite restaurants in madison
all the rest of you should chill
im a big fan of frescas and cucumber beverages so i ordered the cucumberkumquat fresca it was very refreshing and delicious
they also have gluten free dough as well
for appetizers we got the hot rock and the king alaskan crab tacos
upon her complimenting me on my dress and inquiring as to our plans for the evening my husband informed her that it was my birthday
happy plates all around
its a treat to get pizza from mamas
my friend tried to squeeze whatever life was still left in that little bottle but he was only able to manage one drop or so
but then again i am spoiled having actually traveled to nepal to dine on authentic native food so of course the cuisine even replicated in the us is going to come up short to me
more importantly the food was exceptional
my intention was to order the etoufee
i had a vet appointment and i had a bit of time to spare so i decided to eat here for breakfast
the show is also very intimate
it was a last minute trip and we were happy to get a seating for later on the night of our arrival
this place is absolutely healthy and awesome
the quality of the burger is first rate
i explained to the manager i am not looking for free food
im sad to say that this neighborhood joint of mine wont be getting any of my money again
the lettuce was crisp and fresh but the olives were really disgusting and were what gave the salad the playdoh taste
definitely try this place because its affordable and delicious
good vibe and space with good views of the strip
we had two pieces of pizza left and the waiter asked if we wanted them boxed up
the ruben egg rolls are a must try
we were thinking about doing korean bbq but it might have been a little much for a sunday lunch so this is what we went with instead panchan small appetizer dishes comes with the meal were plentiful and they also gave us steamed egg
according to husband steak is tender and he likes the spaghetti sauce which is from the all you can eat salad bar
the people were super friendly and my order was ready and waiting
third the drinks were fabulous
not really a wine person but i am easily amused so i had fun perusing their wine list this way
so this is a place you may want to stay away from if youre a vegan or a recent heart bypass or replacement patient
and whats more
i guess they had an ac issue and hadnt finished the duct work
the square one was amazingly delicious with its cheese and meat
definitely worth multiple visits to try their numerous menu items for such a low price
the quality of the food is just normal nothing really special and plus service wasnt that friendly either while i was there
great food awesome company so much smiles and laughter
the shocking thing is the price of the normal drinks
thats why you eat it with plain white rice
do not waste your money at this place
the creme brulee was delicious
yes the tacos were small but thats what authentic tacos are
the food is fresh and very filling
apart from that everything else was amazing
i have no issues with it
ill have to get with her since we were there together
i always order the general tsos chicken here
the burgers were so good and they tasted very fresh
the band rambunctious play from time to time  unmissable experience
at lunch dillys was semi crowded with business people but the line moved fast
try it and youll love it i promise
so incredibly delicious
great little cheesesteak place
small spot but decorated nicely
almost all of the stuff at the counter is super delicious and well worth trying
it was ok for adults
the service was attentive
great atmosphere it is a little bit brighter than id like to see at a dinner place
had severe food poisoning after having ayce lunch at this place
some wonderful flavor combinations i have not experienced before
es war handwerklich gut gemacht aber nicht einprgsam
pas trs clair surtout quon paie le plein prix 14 si je ne me trompe pas
itd take awhile to make the rice what
customer service bad
about 30 minutes later we got a phone call from the delivery driver to confirm our address
its not clear how the points get earned or how to redeem
i got the sea bass cake to start
i was surprised by the big variety of their beer options
was looking for some place near the sound academy to get some food and drink before the cars show and this was the place
i was so happy to taste a proper onion soup
had to bump it down to 1 star
mellow mushroom really packs on the ingredients and spreads to the edges but the crust is not crispy and can never be made crispy the way i like it by baking it longer probably because of the dough ingredients
got home the wife loved the regular as usual
they serve them with warm maple syrup with a cinnamon stick steeping in it
food wonderful salsa and chips
everyone was very happy with their meal and im sure you will be too
i have traveled to many large foodie cities and this is one of the best chinese restaurants that i have visited
too bad because i used to look forward to them
the portions are huge like a large sized bowl of pho
i havent had a chance to eat here yet so ill update my review once i do
so it was totally the wrong way
the shrimp were actually pretty good but they turned out to be the highlight of the evening45 minutes after finishing our salad and appetizer we still hadnt seen our entrees and none of the waitresses would even look in our direction
great sandwiches with fresh bread
i also notified the employee that on several of the entrees we had ordered which were supposed to include chicken that there was very little chicken present he felt the need to tell me that because of the recession chicken was expensive
leave the nutella for something else
it was so nice and warm
i agreed to meet some friends here and was at first a little bummed because i thought i wouldnt really be able to find something to eat
this is one original b maryeven has homemade lola ketchup in itdont turn up your nose youtry it and youll be a believer too
and for the cost it was pretty unenjoyable
good authentic hawaiian food  awesome price  super generous portion
i asked her if i can order mochi and fried ice cream she just said one time
the service was above average especially for an asian place and food came readily too
come on even my 7 year old knows flour tortillas should be soft and supple
my goto is the lunch special 3 while portions and pricing are fair the seating is disappointing because of the small space
i went with a scoop of salmon  a scoop of spicy tuna
our waitress went through the flavours and i ordered lemon
if you ever want to know what a perfectly cooked piece of fish or steak tastes like go here
would definitely eat here again
decent low and mid shelf stuff
you got to save room for dessert to try this slice of cake
really great place for simple and casual food not far from campus
service was great and monique our server we could have taken her home with us
we started with spring rolls and crab puffs as an appetizer and they were both to die for
the room wasnt as clean as i would have expected
coffee costs 350 yikes
the meat was tender and cooked to perfection
i tasted them all day
time to try new stuff
all the food was delicious although next time i will try and order a bigger portion of my appetizer over gf pasta because it was much much better than the entree
take that sam fox
its a family business
service was great
beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world
the food is tasty and fresh
i literally live 2 mins from this place
otherwise the service is nice and friendly
many of the dishes were still served on individual serving plates or bowls
ive also heard the happy hour here is really good
the bruschetta is very tasty
it was all delicious split between 2 people with left overs
the inside is very nice
authentic delicious italian home style food
ordered by 620pm
our teppanyaki chef was fun and very entertaining
this isnt one of them
the drinks were served in freaking giant mason jars and the bourbon was not a weak pour
tablemates had ribs and the steak sandwich and both had rave reviews
they also have a nice moroccan chicken dish a tasty beef pasta casserole and a good tandoori
the husband swears by the crudite appetizer and even i who doesnt always love the green things really enjoyed it
this is by far the worst food i have ever tasted
they have the best bun bo hue in toronto
im told it will just be a few moments as they prepare the table
great food wine and service
but we still got a table with a view of the bellagio fountains
and during the warmer months their outdoor dining patio is a nice touch
i would have considered a 5 star but our service just wasnt good
the last thing i want to have in my face is smoke while im eating
i come to the fringe every year and always end up eating fast food for dinner at 330pm because theres no good alternative
all in all i am never coming back
please dont get rid of this special ever
for what this place is it came as a pleasant surprise
we got very nice service
there are many better options in old montreal than this pretentious illperforming restaurant
wings are fine better from most of the places
my friend and i walked it craving a korean bbq
im sure if i actually played golf this place would get five stars
pigs which will later in a round of great irony be part of a buffet
both were fantastic though a little smaller than i would have preferred for the price
after we determined what we want to order we closed the menus showing that we were ready to order
i love going to a restaurant that pays attention to detail
he told me that i had to try to this place as it was one of the best places he had mongolian beefever
the one question youll ask yourself is it worth a maximum 2 hour wait
you can pick out your fish and lobster alive from their tanks
we wait for our server to come by the table
a few standout tapas pieces i had were the mac n cheese the pork empanada as well as the chicken and mushroom soup
the owner however did apologize but we arent sure if we will go back or not
very well served
at first i enjoyed the freindly environment and enjoyed the attractive waitresses however things went south fast there were children everywhere and i am not a nice person aroud children when i drinklol
called for a veggie burger
since driveins essentially died out with the nixon administration theres a bit of a learning curve here for anyone under the age of 60 that hasnt experienced one before
when they shy away from shots i always tell my friends that it doesnt matter how they feel about tequila
they do have a few new things on the menu that i may try on my next visit
the decor isnt the greatest but it definitely makes you feel like you are somewhere other than little mt
another 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive
watching the bartenders was quite a treat as they seem to really enjoy their jobs and like others commented their drink list is ample and creative
nothing to knock your socks off but an enjoyable experience and i would definitely go back
i order twice 2 tacos each time
people are rude and they all drag there feet when they walk
just not special at all
the food pops
the service is great and the people who work there are so nice to talk with
the pizza is pretty good thin crust brickoven baked
she can cook and he makes u feel at home
plus its michael mina and i hadnt been here yet
the service started off not great with us having to constantly remind our servers about things they forgot
great wings and great curly fries
over time it seems like the quality of their food has gotten worse
they flametorch the sashimi and it gives it an amazing flavour and texture
we visted this amazing place around 8ish when it was still a lounge
i worked with maria throughout the process and she made it very easy
i ordered online and was told it did not go through
had they offered a substitution or removing it from the check we would give it another try but my bbq flat bread wasnt worth 20
when i go to a restaruant i want to eat something better than i can makei know it takes time and effort to make a good stock which they dont do here
i will be back for breakfast at some point but this wont be my goto spot
i got it about 5 minutes later without even a sorry for the wait
the california is my favourite not too heavy
place is also dirty and run down
found this place while walking down queen
sweet potatoe tots with cajon mayo dip awesome
my camembert fritto was to die for the cheese was so hot and gooey and the accompanying tomato sauce was just perfect
the k pop music was playing overhead
mother bunch brewery is a awesome addition to the downtown neighborhood
the only thing ive ever ordered there is the calzones because they are amazing
so i decided to check out this place after hearing a couple good things about it
and the service was excellent
shower drained very slowly
this place is in a decent location and there is always parking available unlike most places in richmond hill and markam
not spicy at all and a bit bland
however there are some items i just cant get elsewhere and im glad ht makes them available to me and no one at walmart is going to go out of their way to make sure im finding what i need and if i could use any help
wonderful wine list and yummy desserts
i would highly recommend coming here to anyone
for a real slice of mexican in montreal look no further
the kale and dumplings were also very good
the hot wings were super hot especially the boneless wings for some reason
i had three servers and my iced tea was always full
try sushisamba if you are in vegas to get a delectable and unique sushi experience
not a place i go to during the day but late night when they start smoking the meat outside on the bbq it is as good as it gets in torontojerk has to be done on a coal bbq to get that taste you get in yardwill never taste as good as you get real chicken in ja but this is about as close as it gets never go to the spot a few doors down just to save wait time they are not nearly as good they cook until 46 in the morning so this is the alternative to mcdonalds if you are willing to drive whoever decided to keep them open until extreme late night is a geniusluckily i live right beside the highway so the drive is not that big of an issue  i usually just get the 10 dollar chicken load it with the sauce they have add some hot sauce and remember the times in ochi
service definitely bumped this place to a 5 stars
and this fact makes it unique in a college town where most people are craving for cheap junk food
after inquiring about the menu it turns out everything is pretty much a la carte
my last order was the basil shaken chicken
makes eating there all the more exciting
however by sitting at the bar we had an entertaining and educational view of the staff
the rooms were dirty as the maids couldnt be bothered to lift the bed skirts to vacuum underneath the bed
the bread was excellent  nice and chewy
a few bites later he looked at me and said its just not good
its our go to sushi place
i find it hard giving anyone or anything a 5star but this review isnt about the aweinspiring story of how i overcame being so anl well maybe it is
its way cool
will be back often
we had to wait over an hour for a table
this place is great for fountain hills
the owner is a great guy and a total foodie
both were good just not great
my husband and i were treated with such kindness and genuine cheer by staff we felt like a king and queen that day
the flakiest and most flavorful arabstyle baklava i have ever had and ive been eating baklava my entire life  it also keeps remarkably well
considering the price of food in general on the strip id say jjs is worth considering for a nice change of pace for breakfast
i would go here more often except that i live in phoenix now
not coming here ever again
i had the baja power bowl 12 which was amazing and the bells twohearted ale both were awesome
they are packed well and dont fall apart when picked up
order food first and then pay afterwards
i really enjoyed this dish but by this time i was stuffed
that aside the food here can be pretty good
only complaint was we all wished there were more hash potatoes and fruits on our plates
bibimbap 45  good but i prefer some meat in my bibimbap
excellent service from charles and nice guy to chat with
not the most mexicany of mexican places ive been to but passable as mexican food
she and i get very different pizzas and mine always has the extra sauce of course they put the extra sauce on her pizza so she couldnt eat it because the extra sauce makes the pizza too spicy for her and mine of course is too dry for me
the broth is very good
we did have the fries as an appetizer and they were off the chart good
focaccia served with honey and sea salt butter is food crackso addictive
service was pretty good given the fact that a manager was also assisting the wait staff
food was american chain style executed well but misses the individuality of a local restaurant
another plus about wicked spoon is that most of their selections come in individually portioned plates since that makes it less messy and so you arent picking around at food that other people touched
great for an adult dinner out
the home made french fries were topped with vegetarian gravy  that tasted like some really fresh roasted chicken pan drippings and loaded with a generous portion of mild cheese curds
my companion and i did the sake pairing each of them were great and complemented the sushi perfectly
ive found my go to sandwich shop
first experience at barrio queen a texmex spot that is trying to be a mexican restaurants but is definitely not
i cant speak to the dinein experience since we took it home
recommend the cowboy burger if youre in the mood to indulge
we ordered many dishes to share as family style dining which included halibut dayboat scallops prime angus flat iron and prime bonein new york strip
it was too thick for me and felt too fillingheavy on the stomach
this place is small so i would awalys make reservations
its a sit down restaurant has a varied menu and the prices were right in line
i remember it being a decent restaurant a few years ago so i decided to stop by for dinner after a long time
left her a 005 tip which is too bad cause i normally tip around 25 if your good
id love to go back just to enjoy their dim sum offerings
and everything comes quickly and with a smile
the tacos here are very small
so we left
both meals were loaded with meat and the taste was amazing
for now ill stick to the happy hour or dining at the bar where service is more attentive
my friend had the crab club sandwich which he said was very good although the fries which came with it were slightly salty and over seasoned
ive been here for lunch with coworkers a quick bite before dinner a romantic date night wine  dine a relaxing drink on the patio in the dusk of summer
tried the asparagus with chorizo that is not a chorizo but a different sausage type
went there last night for dinner and was really surprised with this place
we figured because it was a new place maybe they were still trying to get the hang of things and so we cut them some slack and decided we would come back to sunday
very good food
we went to the bar and the bartender greeted us and took our order as we stood two deep
very flavorful dishes  pumpkin and green curries the red and green curry noodle dishes tofu paradise appetizer and tom kha soup are all excellent
we were seated right away and our server let us know hed be with us shortly
i came here on a friday night around 9pm
the candy store is amazing with so many varieties to choose from
the ice cream was as good as youd expect
i used to travel almost every week for about 5 years so ive been in my share of crummy and good airports domestically and internationally
we were seated right away in a corner booth
the cesar is real with all the correct and authentic ingredients
no need for nerves here
8709  went with friends from out of town and decided to have a bunch of apps before going out for the evening
unfortunately we waited an additional 10 minutes for our sushi boat which came on a plate and not an actual boat of which we saw many were available
from start to finish our stay at mgm was fantastic
amazing menu but more importantly amazing ownership and staff
we are picky when it comes to seafood must be fresh and prepared well
one of my favorite places to eat ever
at one point in the past they have a station in the restaurant in the front that they make tortillas from scratch
steaks are cooked to order and you see people preparing and cooking
i like the salads and all the breakfast items
however i work about a mile away and at least once a week someone brings some in
you can place an order through the yelp app and even split the bill through it too
i absolutely love taking friends there when theyre visitingor just going there for beers or tea
the beef is very tender and extremely flavourful
i really liked my burger
the bartenders are 90 female who have obviously not been trained in customer service and just expect to be tipped for just being there
i dont normally review fast food joints mostly because theyre all pretty similar unless one is really really good or really really bad
the cocktail menu is a work of art and a history lesson all in one
with extensive travel experience in the region i know i am probably being overly knit picky
when we finally sat down our waitress came but seemed to lack basic knowledge of terms in the sushi world
great a la carte selections
the food was unbelievably delicious and the portions are gigantic
the cupcakes are decorated beautifully and so tender and moist and the lemon zest tartlet was to die for
i had one of the specials which was spinach and cheese ravioli in an alfredo sauce
it puts ajs and the upscale safeways to shame
seriously havent had such a great experience at a restaurant like this ever
the bacon was half raw the hamburger was cold and greasy as were the hash browns
not 30 bucks good but good nonetheless
he ended up getting chicken and i got the most amazing crab covered salmon with risotto
ive never gone in and found neglected tables trash on the floor or super sloppy drink station
oddly enough i also found a piece of chicken
the food came out very fast
highly recommendedgreat happy hour too
the cake was not delicious the tea was in a tea bag
i have been to other pei wei with better food and service
all in all the food was ok 2 really good dishes and 2 lacklustre ones
their catfish is cooked to perfection
i ordered a small portion of the biscuits and gravy which was 1 biscuit 1 egg
the wait is totally worth it
the staff and service were top notch
not that i have anything against starbucks but im looking forward to visiting smelly cat again
i keep coming back as a loyal patron to the original owner who sold the restaurant and recipes to the current owner
came to this place ready to be impressed after all of the hype
their credit card machine didnt have a tip option so mr owner may be a good idea to reprogram this in
once again loved it  these last two dishes are home runs and the best ive had in las vegas
you can choose a range of spicy options and i went with medium
sat at the 2 seats right at the bar once you open the door
lightly coated with flour and light and zesty
the breakfast is fairly large and even cheaper if you go before 10am and the burgers are quite tasty
relaxed atmosphere with good drinks great food and excellent service
i never have to wait long the food always taste great and things are in order and clean
the server was uber friendly and made some amazing suggestions
now my husband after 2 bites on his sandwich noticed a broken toothpick in his food
this is the first fine dining restaurant i ever went too and i go back as much as possible
we ended up ordering the pad see ew and the pad thai off the main menu
that is insanity
if you want a place to sit thats a good option
i would have seasoned the kebabs a bit more but you do need to cook for the masses i guess
the one with vodka of course
hence the line outside to eat there
the exterior is plain the interior is dark
stopped in this morning for breakfast around 830 the restaurant is clean and casualcomfortable
you will not be sorry
chicken wings are a joke small and over cooked
you cannot pick and choose when you want to be open or not especially when everything states you are open until a specific time
to finish the night off they served us a rum came i believe with candles for my roommates birthday
tried the sampler platter
i like that most of the items on the menu are unique
well continue to be loyal customers for our horror movie  pizza nights
the breakfast burritos are huge so bring a friend
wait staff is rude and pushy
this location doesnt disappoint
this is the best place to get bun bo bue a spicy vietnamese noodle dish served with different noodles and meats than its more popular cousin pho
toilet is in a nook for a lil privacy
we ordered one meatball and it was cold in the center the chicken prosciutto was warm but there was almost no prosciutto in it we ordered broccoli and the server came back to tell us they were out but we could have mashed potatoes instead  who ever has mashed potatoes with pasta we also ordered alfredo and it was incredibly bad  it was as though it had sat out on a counter for a long time the sauce was congealed and completely inedible
i dont drink beer but the lemon martini was good
i ordered the spicy soft tofu soup as usual and it turned out to be really good
food some of the best sushi ive had yet
i really enjoyed oreganos
she was always quick and prompt at getting what we requested
they have valet but since there was parking on the street we parked in a metered parking spot and were quickly entering the container park
no apology the guy just said he would go back and the dish would be out in 5 min
the best burritos i have ever had
for my first experience i really enjoyed it happy hour pricing is great and if you go with dessert try the tempura banana you will definitely enjoy it
we went for happy hour 5 drinks and 5 apps
the evening finally came to an end when a friendly manager came over to our table to ask how everything had been  she was making rounds to all the tables that evening it seemed
lee provided excellent service
it was super greasy and not crunchy at all
it was cheap quick good service and tasty for the price
skinny 5 no vegetables
plain and boring
servicese                  35 however there are a few staffs who should learn to smile more and a bit more attentive
the bill would have been nice but she had to order two long island iced teas that were about 9 each
the prime rib was well prepared
it was just as expected nothing fancy but were greatful that they recognize that not everyone eats meat
filled with a delicious broth and noodles and beef and then all the extras on the side to add the bean sprouts thai basil cilantro lemon and jalapenos
the service was amazing the food was made fast and was hit and fresh
i had the floridian french toast amazing
while the pupusas here were pretty good i cant say the same for some of the plates
at tobys you dont need to keep running to the bathroom to check your hair and makeup you can just come as you are
i would definitely come back again
nothing is a bad choice
my wife and i went here to celebrate eight years of marriage and two months of parenthood
i love the atmospherethey were showing sailor moon my fav anime forever i love the staffs costumes and their services
ok given the price but dont expect restaurant service
just ask warm and friendly knowledge is amply available
the steak was extremely chewy
the pizza dough base was between mediocre and adequate which should not be happening if youre using the proper recipe  proper ingredients
i called immediately when i got home  the order was even  reviewed with me at the bar
i just have to dream about real italian pizza until i set foot in italy some day
the pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent
overpriced and overhyped
the first time i came here it was a wed afternoon at around 430pm
the thing is there are a number of places in the area that are as good for mexican
the food is delicieux sorry my french is rusty and coffee also
clams in white wine butter sauce was sinfully good
ordered shrimp and grits
dropped by for lunch
thank god we decided to share the pizza and tacos
enough for two meals
we both cleaned our plates  then decided to order the apple chimichanga for dessert
grandpa had been craving so i took the whole family here and everyone was thoroughly pleased
the flavor of the bulgogi was ok the kalbi imo was pretty good and the meat chun was probably the worst i have had
we had the sweet shrimp crostini to start that were delicious but could have been a bit larger to share
it was clean and it was friendly
check my reviews and youll see i reserve 5 stars for truly exceptional places like choolah
the bathrooms are eh
he was rude and defensive
however the service was horrendous too
one could order beer on bottle and tap
our first time dining at this establishment
price was expected
i feel bad leaving this review because i always get the same booth and if this places gets popular ill have to waitoh well its damn good
i found the food to be very unappetizing
uh yeah i just bought a burger
im not the biggest fan of the beans but i like everything else
22 times the food has taken way over an hour
i got the chicken biryane with quinoa
our server came and took our orders and was prompt with our drinks and appetizer
unfortunately when it comes to sakura its the latter
nothing was fresh and staff was surly and unpleasent but i didnt really care
the price seems overpriced given the food selection available
we were told the wait may be about 3040 minutes but it was more like 34 minutes as they were able to accommodate us right away
today i decided to finally give it a try
beer was good but thats expected in a brew house that serves their own stuff  great location and beautiful space inside and on the patio  hostesses seemed ditzy and unaware of how to greet and separate customers that are looking for patio seating vs indoor seating  poutine is terrible
the wife and i both had the pork tacos and they were great
literally signed up for yelp just to rant about how disappointing it was
stopped in with my wife during out vegas vacation because i had a groupon and we love seafood
in my travels i always google the haunts of guy fieris triple d and found the downtown lolas location
the lady which was the same lady who had taken my order suddenly changed and said typical delivery times are 4560 minuteshad that been told to me i wouldve drove the 10 minutes there and back myself
but we were a big party and sitting on a big table
the meat was tough and the fat was probably the best part of the taste
tortillas are from san diego and are one of a kind
ill have to admitim cheap maybe because its being chinese and i rather spend my money at the tables or what but ill admit
each breakfast sandwich came on a toasted english muffin and was accompanied by a side of fresh fruit pineapple orange grape honeydew and watermelon
you are going to get terrific old school food and terrific old school service
i ordered one of those favorites and a wrap from the new menu
my husband had the steak and of course their steak is just spectacular
handfuls of chips on your plate or whatever side you order
grilled chicken  grilled cheese and kosher hot dogs can be done to your specs  too
get a rewards card before you order and you can save 1 on each dish you order
i had a tuna sandwich with provolone cheese slightly grilled on the panini press with the housemade potato salad
kind of a dive bar feel to it
this is a fine little place
their breakfast sandwiches are great and they have a variety of lunch sandwiches that will knock your socks off i personally like the double play the crew and the meatball hero
at 2000 for an entree i guess we just expected a little more
sometimes or often things are forgotten in an order so make sure to check before leaving
i loved eating with my hands but was less fond of the smell for the rest of the night
my husband really wanted the waffles but they didnt have any
theres also a big sign that says you will be prosecuted if you dine and dash
we shared a filet which was your average filet that you could get at any steak place
it was way to much clover sprouts
i bought a new dress and was very excited
this place has been tricking people by deep frying its own mediocrity and drenching it in a mayo of cheap tricks and distractions
will def go again
her plate was a pretty large portion but the shrimp and grits seemed really small for 17
the food was very flavorful
note closed weekends
he was feeling really bad
ive been there 5 times or so by the request of my friend that loves the place
every single time i have been here ive never left anything but happy and full
great refrieds too
ordered the schnitzel sandwich and it took most of my lunch hour before it was served
for desert we had the tiramisu and chocolate cake
we did not have reservations and the hostess said that she can get us a reservation at 515  okay so we had a reservation for 7 minutes after we arrived
the salad with the tortilla bowl is quite delicious too
fritz was on the burnt side but the salmon pizza was awesome
chatting up two of the managers after i finished i learned that they take pride in their efforts which showed in the dining experience
will be back here often
all the desserts are delicious too its hard to find good japanese desserts in vegas
also delicious bananas foster french toast
ordered vegetarian pad thai to go
i usually order eggs benedict at any brunch places and eats benedict by far has to be one of my favorites
there is outdoor and indoor seating
finally there was a couple seated with a dog in a dog bed under the table not a service dog which is disgusting and a doorbell that sounded throughout the dining room every time someone arrived or left it was a jarring and unpleasant addition to the atmosphere
the chicken was really good and the surprise ingredients in the salad were roasted bell pepper and jalapenoslots of them
i came here on a sunday night around 11 and when we arrived there was only one other table in the restaurant
dcor 5 out of 5 i really enjoyed the dcor of mp and loved the overall atmosphere of the place
thank you kate
my fiance and i visited this place for our first time and we were very impressed
breakfast here is a great option
now that we have hot bagels i hate to go anywhere else
beware if youre a niners fan because this was filled with giants fans during the nfc championship game but we were in all good spirit of the competition
love our server justin this saturday night
he continued to ignore her and served me slowly and pleasantly while she seethed
c  appetizer  spinach artichoke dip best in town d  entree chicken beer bread sandwich with fries and a side of jalapeno dressing e  dessert stout milkshake
pupusas are always good here i cant complain about that
flavorful food in surprisingly large portions
went for brunch about 1pm
i ordered the chicken caesar salad and the waiter brought a salad with salmonno problem a simple mistake he took it back and two minutes later he was back with the salad which i could tell it was the same from before since it still had the fishy smell and taste of the salmon the chicken was precooked and warmed up probably in a microwave and thrown in the salad no croutons no bacon bits and mozzarella cheese instead of parmigiano the cook didnt even bother to remove the portion of the salad in contact with the fishso it was a rather kinky salad  a salad that smelled like fish but tasted like chickenill assess my options next time i think about a place to go
art was our server and he was astounding with friendly and efficient service
jaime offered menu insights to make sure everyone would be happy with their orders all if the food was excellent
not that it mattered as no one else came in while i was there
you really dont feel like you are in las vegas  its a serene feeling on the lake watching swans float by
beef noodle soup was also good
the food was good bit not out of this world
its a cute little place that mostly serves tacos and burritos and nachos
the caprinha is one of the best ive had cant go wrong with anything on the food menu either
i wish there were more options for beer but what they have was not bad
very good cool and romantic place if youre looking for some place to spend an evening with your friends
also got the bacon macaroni and cheese which i absolutely love
i did get it mooyah style
today we arrived for our reservation that stated we had a dog
the place itself is very cute is cozy and homey the waiters were all nice gentleman
were all over 21 but we definitely dont look like it
the bun was super soft but sturdy and fries were really really good even after i let them sit for a while they still had a crispness to them
i ordered 3 courses with wine paired with each course
we tried hamachi sashimi and spicy tuna roll
worst buffet i have ever been to in vegas
they were roasted and served with thick chucks of bacon and thin slices of pear
if you want to just go in and drink then i recommend senior frogs
overall 5050 good bad
cant say enough good stuff
delicious hot bread was also served
im going to point out the worst offenders on the menu that ive personally experienced
my friend and i ordered steak and fried rice
this place is a really unfortunate case
i left a third of it bc i couldnt take it anymore
the baristas are nice and down to earth
a few items we miss and would love to eat again include the happy hour bbq spare ribs and the chocolate cupcake
the verdict from my parents 2 thumbs up
this is not good customer service by any means especially considering she knows i come there all the time
the rusty barrel is a well run establishments
with attitude and back talk they procede to remake my fries again then forget tat im there waiting for my fries
i try to make here once a year
for entrees we tried the korean short ribs and maple duck
we could have had better food elsewhere for the same price had we known they werent going to let us bowl
when we asked the hostess to send her over still no server
these were fantastically fluffy and i wanted to eat many more pieces after we had finished them
the restaurant was nowhere near busy the night we were there but it took our server forever and a day to bring our drinks
the food was good it was just big servings
i guess the real irony is that i wouldnt feed this crap to my dog and he wouldnt eat it
i was expecting more from this placebut its just aok food is nice but nothing impressive tea doesnt have too much varieties
they were nice but it would have been more helpful to have them with our food
my bf had the muffins and gravy which he loved
appam soft but not sweet enough beef syrian good masala but the beef was overcooked malabar mutton stew poorly seasoned will not be trying that again malabari roti good but not the same as the original this one is a little crispy and not soft
i had a 400 coupon for my friend and i to share with our meals
not worth it at 10 a head when i didnt think it was good enough to warrant seconds
sat down and perused the cocktail menu and they had a decent wee selection going from around 7 quid up to ridiculous
our waiter was nice but imho was def more concerned and preoccupied w the larger party birthday group than his other tables
i told one of the cooks that they already refunded us and he told me to just take it
everything here is amazing
theyre licensed with both beer and a few mixed drinks on offered
we enjoyed the savory carne in both dishes
ive had take out from here for lunch and its okay since im in the area
the menu was not too big not too small but justttt right
it looked great and my husband and i both being vegetarians liked the looks of the veggie enchiladas and the veggie fajitas
people next to us had buffalo chicken dip  smelled horrible but looked interesting
cake eclairs napoleon cookies and more
we were a party of 2 so apparently we werent important
diese sind selbst zubereitet und mit den normalen in deutschland erhltlichen gummiringen nicht zu vergleichen
our server was excellent and somehow we merged our picks from the great tapas on the menu for one of the best meals i have ever had
i like the fact the slices are one price
i will certainly returnand next time ill make room for dessert
i have only had good experiences with the service here
it has been many years since i had lunch at the duck and decanter on camelback
never ordering the orange chicken and mayo walnut shrimp ever again sure the venue was convenient to my home
and our card definitely worked there
i had a toasted croissant with eggs and peameal
overall my assessment is that cheddars has a long way to go to become a smooth running restaurant
waitress kinda argued with me when i told her i only got 4 pieces of sushi when there was supposed to be 6 on the plate
faustos never disappoints
i cant comment on the advertised pool parties i see some reviewers complaining about but as a nightclub or a place to go during the day to have a drink chill out and mingle this place is awesome
the service is very friendly and the atmosphere is a happy one
we were invited by friends
amen for that
service was not terrible but far from memorable
this place is so packed that you barely get service
staff our server was nice efficiently attentive
we had tastings of 4 things
did i mention the gigantic waterfall of chocolates
this is the country with the fat people remember
he said if i wasnt going to pay for pizza then he would take them all back
im not sure how this was the best thing i ever ate on foodnetwork
the servers were friendly
as a student this place is budgetfriendly
service is quick quality is good ive never gotten sick after eating anything there
the service was sub par as the woman making my food left to watch tv as my food cooked again nothing special
i mean it was typical brewerytype food burgers steak etc
burgers are huge and tasty
its as if no one on the staff cares anymore
horrible service and poor management i ordered 4 smoothies and 3 sandwiches
the service here has always been consistent with a  very friendly staff
then i regretted eating too mucha great end to the evening
works every time
best wishes was scribbled on the plate
a must in vegas never had a bad experience here ever the staff goes above and beyond to make sure your satisfied and music adds a nice touch
definitely will come back again
id love to try the other food they have but those two are so good that i cant bear to get anything else
the staff was friendly and efficient and the food was excellent
for some reason or another a trip to makino everytime im in vegas to see the folks has unknowingly become a chang family tradition
the sides of potatoes and cucumbers helped a bunch
definitely a favorite bookmark for us  last note guy fieri the food networks driveins diners and dives has been here  left his mark not very difficult to find as long as you dont continuously look at the floor
it is a nice lil cafe
my husband and i love viet thai
the food quality was good
we will not return
ive never had a thing here i didnt like
portions are large one order can easily be good for 23 prices do go up however and the owner will never give you anything for free white rice even if youve been a regular for years
the potato chips with house made ranch were good but after having the flavorful fries they seemed well bland
definitely not home made
nothing overly fancy but good staple items from what i tried order the house roll but beware its as big as a 6 inch subway sandwich
super nice staff and everyone looks like they are having a good time
great prices on great food
i think that sums it up  i always feel like im relaxed on a little vacation when im at postino
i loved my dry aged bone in ribeye
they have great food at reasonable prices
its lovely and is no longer the coolest kid in the neighbourhood so on a thursday at 8pm i didnt have to wait for a table
have had wonderful experiences here since i was a little girl
cest sans conteste lun des points de rassemblement fort estims de la communaut italomontralaise
need to mention its located right across from the bus terminal
i went here for the first time today
i was greeted by the friendly cashier who was open to answering all of my first time client questions
we asked when ordering if this was ok and she never asked what kind of meat just said thanks and rushed us to be done
the bread comes from one of the best bakeries around
i love their caprese panini and grilled cheese sandwich
weve been here a few times a year over the last 5 years and it is consistent
i know food
they sell japanese street food such as takoyaki karayaki and okonomiyaki both hiroshima  osaka style
the staff is very friendly
we were there shortly after they opened the food was just ok tasting the first time and i thought over priced for what you got
the other night my friend and i had the ceasar salad and tiramisu and were sick in the bathroom for 24 hours up and out
im not a big fan of cheese pizza but theirs is delicious
again outside the waitstaff was always in the ready and drinks deserts etc  were delivered quickly and with a smile
you would never expect such a gem in such an unassuming strip mall
overall though thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and would definitely recommend this place
the freaking bun was noteworthy as well
half yukon gold half sweet potato nice patio on the side of the building which makes springsummer visits that much better
went in for a quick lunch
the ambiance is a little off somehow but the food ive had has been great
left to our own devices we came here for a period of time
im happy to share how rude  unapologetic you were
make sure to double check everything before you pick it up chances of error is only 99
ive been here a few times but the last time friday was just meh
fast service and great food
they didnt have any creative vegan dessert options
they have always been excellent
food was ok i expected more
i only ate a little bit couldnt eat anymore
i had to settle for the large cod dinner and it was almost enough to fill me up
decided to retry dominos as i was getting bored of some of the other pizzerias
when i order delivery it takes the normal 30 min to arrive so not bad at all
but this place is the best because the owner is quirky loves his business and makes a great schnitzel sandwich
i will bring more friends here next time
the portions are quite conservative however so if you are a hefty man make sure you order the steak twice
ive definitely picked out some favorites that im having difficulty swaying away from thus preventing me from trying something new
i just found the toppings to be moist as they should certainly not wet
good vibe here well return
tender with wellbalanced burnt marks it finished me off with an ending quite more than happy
and not your hands
was she out of her mind
interesting beer selectionsrecommend
i actually much prefer the banchan here over the ones given at buk chang
very good both times
how has a review not been written about this place
but if it werent i wouldnt care id drive an hour to eat here
fried pork skin
definitely the best chinese place in town
i even asked if he would have enough kitchen and wait staff to handle our group and was assured that they would be wellstaffed and it wouldnt be a problem
its creamy and crunchy in all the right places and the fries will knock your socks off
the veggie roll was really good it had corn which was different
the only solution is that i should come here more often
go anywhere else
i looked at the shrimp and noticed is was covered in blacks spots and portions of it were raw
i visited during a very slow time and was astonished at how dirty and gross it was
couldnt recommend the place enough
in a pita
i have always received good service and the food quality and preparation has always been consistent
sunday brunch is a c but its cheap
i cant find authentic mexican food like this anywhere else
give this place a try
will definitely come back next time i visit arizona
the restaurant looks like it would be small but it goes far back and is fairly big
my wife and i ate at grimaldis today
bonnes salades excellents sandwichs sur pain au levain maison dlicieux plats chauds pour emporter excellente varit de boissons et superbe slection de sucreries et chocolats locaux
as a ramen fanatic ive tried most of the ramen shops in the city
service was a bit slow when we first arrived but a few minutes later the entire staff was literally bending over backwards to ensure we were well taken care of and enjoying our food
ok lets make this review fast and easy
their machine allowed ae and the transaction has been approved but the waitress forced us to reverse transaction and used another credit card
this visit here has been the worse jackinthebox visit ever
service was great
they go so far out of their way to be unhealthy that it is gross
i am sure i will go to this place again as it is not far from the house
good  1 nice ambiance 2 quickly seated 3 i like the cesar salad salmon chicken marsala and desserts
it ended up being only around 10 which is not too shabby for the strip
no queso fresco no onions no cilantro
if it was aiming to be a breakfast joint  it might score higher with me
dont let the stars full you this place is new and i went in and it was full but it was packed whoever is putting bad star is a breakfast hater
the decor as previously mentioned is very typical nica
my husband gets a dish that i dont have a clue how to spell  chilequiles or something like that
the chinese broccoli was slightly steamed with the perfect amount of oyster sauce the thing that makes great chow fun is when the beef is tender the noodles tasted fresh because it wasnt mushy or soggy and the bean sprouts were firm not wilted
lots of spices and flavor  all coming in three large skewers of meat
i cant wait to go back and try all the other sushi that we missed out on
pros fairly extensive menu
wound up smoking a good cigar and having a few pints
we will definitely be back again
little pricey but totally worth it
i want to say that the food is great
stick with shuhei or pacific east or the food bar at heinens
our waitress was very good and the manager checked with us to see how everything was
i had the eggplant was cooked well but was bland
the lunch buffet is a great deal
my kiddo likes the mac and cheese and the lentil soup as well as the mashed potatoes and gravy
my husband loves their hot links and spicy sausage
it has a good taste but my bread was completely soggy
i love their mimosas
went there yesterday one of the worst indian restaurants i have been to
the food also took somewhat longer than expected
the menu had tons of options and the food was very fresh and delicious
1010 service in a chain restaurant is an undertaking worth writing yelp about
for my first round i got a whiskey sour nothing to be impressed about but wasnt terrible either the other 2 got beers theyve never had they liked them
however our ribeye arrived overdone and as we ate the steak became closer to a welldone than a medium which was not so great
the service was horrible the food was even worse
the staff are always hospitable and happy to chat if they have the time
i give pita jungle a slightly better rating for its garlic dip but its still worth ordering here
definitely will be back
we should of taken the hint when we saw the closed sign on the door but it was open
weve been coming here for years and have always had good food and service
i wish the bar was a little bigger
my green curry dish was simply not very good
now this is becoming rare in toronto but what sets corner house apart is that the food is exceptional as well
the drivethrough makes it super convenient too
cool location 810 points drinks 410 employee treatment 110 treat your employee better
the cheaper items not worth trying stick with meat items like steak ribs and wings
i also liked the lack of customers
however they were tender and nearly falling off the bone
good choice for multicultural gatherings
it was 130 in the afternoon there were about 4 tables occupied
both of us loved our entrees
rigatoni pollo diced chicken cutlet hot  sweet peopers san marzano tomatoes  reggiano parmesan cheese the rigorous was a bit too al dente for me
my go tos are always a ume box with a fusion maki on the side
we were there on a tuesday evening when it was very quiet and it took 45 minutes for our entrees we didnt order appetizers
another time the cappuccino machine spit the hot beverage out onto my hand and not in the cup
i got the becka snicla wienerschnitzel  breaded pork tenderloin skillet potatoes creamed spinach
outstanding food and service
i ate at the continental grill today for the first time
fried squid delicious
it was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big
lets talk service
first off the service was excellent
the manager needs to run these shady folks away call metro or whatever get rid of them
the shrimp scampi was a little bland and i had to add salt
the kitchen closes around 1130midnight
they left us unattended for quite a while
their specials menu always has the most delicious items on it like the ny strip with fresh crab hollandaise which was amazing normally i find this sauce lacking and spicy chipotle sauce
i guess this is a neighborhood hangout as the local traffic will keep it afloat
this is hands down the best breakfast ive had in arizona
prices have increased and portion size has decreased
im not saying thats our only purpose for going there but my husband and i like to get dinner to go and play while we wait
i love a nofrills kind of place like this charlotte has too few of them these days
but i would definitely get a burrito to go and savour the flavour at home
there is full service at the bar and it wasnt busy at all so we ate there
for our main course we had to try the signature miso black cod
it is also served with 56 delicious varied sides kimchi sliced tofu potatoes in barley sauce marinated bean sprouts tiny fishes sauteed fish cakes and a couple of others
in fact you should almost always leave here exactly the opposite practically uplifted
was quite pricey but great food
i saw some other customers with the fish and chips and they looked greati think next time that will be what i get
incredibly  sophisticated and delicious
georges should be careful how they advertise their dishes french
and then when my friend said how his reaction was disrespectful he told us well dont come back then
if that were the case this place would definitely get 5 stars
my friend joined me that year and agreed that hot n juicy was just that
when the food came out it wasnt 100 correct as one of my three tacos was not what i ordered and while presentation of the food was on point the taste at this visit left something to be desired
there were 20 people in the place max so there really was no excuse
it was very educational because we took a tour of the brewery we learned its history and we learned all the steps and ingredients that go into brewing different types of beers
we ordered the chicken biryani
nice portion size
we had her put out name down and we went to the bar to grab a drink before happy hour ended at 7  i believe the drink specials were 4 wells and beers 6 wine and selected cocktails
i dont go to a restaurant for the design of a restaurant i dont think anyone does
great for studying or a date or a chat with a friend
we walked into an old fashioned diner with pink booths surrounded old time memorabilia and smiling faces as they greeted us
i love this place
we ordered the calamari meatballs and pizza special
their menu consists of so many options that i cant wait until i go back to try more
i do have to say that their wings were a descent size thou
definitely coming back when i wanna get my nacho fix
and i actually wonder what i am missing when i read other peoples rave reviews
my friend loves the salsa but you have to specifically ask for it as they always default to the hot sauce
what a disappointment
very upset i havent been back and i love that place
so sayonara sushi rock its been real but i probably wont be back
ordering 2 ramens and a dish of fried chicken came to approximately 30
good drink selection interesting options had some jalenpeno margarita of some sorts  nice upscale place with a very friendly comfortable atmosphere
i know what real good quality mexican food is and this isnt it
standard juice typical hot chocolate but better than red white  blues
good service too
seats are a bit limited so call ahead for reservation
sie erluterte uns dass es sich hierbei um eine art erfrischendes sorbet handelte
great one size chicken pho chicken soup
this is the place i can get married in and have my cake too
the egg rolls are
we order from here at least once a week and they have the best chicken burittos and you cant beat the price
then i get home and our order was switched or something because the only person who got any famous daves was my husband
people eat with their eyes
old number of the lakewood location forwards to the new location in fairview park
the chef made the night very exciting and lively
paul got a chicken pesto burger and i got the tofu club sandwich
garlic bread sucked
i feel like i made the perfect decision for my sunday very tasty food 500 beers to chose from and amazing costumer service
the only negatives would be the chairs
some restauranteur came up with a gimmick and it caught on
it was slow so it was very noticeable when there were servers just pacing the floor gathered nearby gossiping staring at tables
thank goodness another server who had a table nearby kept our waters full
i feel like im stepping into the dining room of my longlost mexican family
while nothing on the menu is insanely priced it is a bit high for what you get
more like 35 stars than 4
finally the tongue brioche
one of my favorite breweries in town and it probably helps that i lived within walking distance for so many years
service from oliva my waitress was fantastic
we each chose to build our own plates
pros sundays they have great brunch food and if the weather is good we like to sit outside and stare into the meadows
my rita came out perfect
if you do go i would highly recommend the crab curry
we took a while to order because we found the combos on the back of the menu a bit hard to navigate
the drink menu is pretty large and it took us a few minutes to decide on what we wanted
what the hell
i highly recommend their blueberry shake
its as authentic as it gets and totally comparable if not better than the barbecue you will find in central texas
bruschetta i only had one of these because i found them a little difficult to eat
and the zucchini and sweet potato noodles are not noodles they are shredded raw veggies im not sure it qualifies as noodles so all in all its not bad but definitely not worth the price and i wont be back
every bite was heaven
friendly  fun atmosphere
we ordered the katsu donburi and curry katsu with rice
it was literally beef and cheese melted on a plate
i came here last weekend for a deli breakfast and i had very low expectations based on many of the yelp reviews i read and visiting this place in the distant past
as always i will be back again and again
i have been a long term fan of hafeweizen id venture to say that my pronunciation is fairly accurate  resulted from practicing saying that every time i need a beer
food is average but not worth the 45 min wait for a breakfast order
this restaurant is a hugger
this used to be good pizza but sadly no longer
the only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive
i felt very happy after the friendly staff served up a hot pizza to our table
the food is clean and tasty
love love love this place
i wouldnt make plans to go to bison witches again but i might go there again if pressed
overall a weak aok for me and another place i probably wont be returning to when you got tastier oodles of noodle options in chinatown and be careful the popo may get you here for jwokking  aloha
it definitely has a modern downtown feel for being in the suburb in decor and price
loved both rooms
the manager looked like she was intimidating the girl making my food so she was scared to put anything on it
how do you even begin to review a place like this
mexico sure is a long way from wisconsin and i walked into abuleos with a certain amount of resignation that it was probably going to be a bad meal
service  510  agree with one of the other reviewers that the seemingly anything goes vibe in terms of waitstaff clothing was a bit odd
got me usually good foodplaced was packedsteak was average and french fries coldservice was fine
we will definitely be back to try something new on the menu everything weve had was fantastic
continue eating it
and thats usually the best part of the pot pie
fresh fish flown in from the mediterranean on shelves of ice and tanks full of shellfish
we eat a lot of greek food in brazil and i have to admit that before eating at big fat greek i thought that greek food was better in brazil
ordered the andouille corn dogs and pulled pork topped fries for a starter they were great
so i sat for a few seconds before i went hunting for food
a mustcome place
good quality meats and killer hot sauces
we ordered their gnocchi poutine the beastwich the crab cakes benny  and the french press coffee in the decaf flavour due to acid being lower in the decaf
id recommend spending the few extra dollars for this pizza
the best part of this place is the atmosphere
i dont know how it is still in business
she never stop by to asked if we need anything else she didnt even refill our drinks i had to asked her
the portions are huge and i had enough for 2 meals
the staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another
but somehow i convinced him to get in the car and head towards tempe
the prices of the martinis are a little high but these martinis are bigger than  most that i get at other bars so well worth it
restaurant review i can see why some people in champaign dont buy in with the yelp reviews
we also shared a sushi and sashimi boat with spicy golden dragon roll
we had the pleasure of meeting taryn who is the owner  baker of these muffin creations
so i guess if you want to take a chance on getting ripped off go there if not stay clear
good food and friendly staff
all in all a great lunch but id love to go for a game
snow crabs  they slice them in half while chilled  hint  go to the italian side and they have them properly hot
they said about a half hour and i asked if it was possible to be put on the list over the phone since im driving there now
great experience at citizen phhighly recommend the food and ambience trust me well worth the price
we shared the balboa just a mound of amazing italian meats a slice of provolone on some amazing bread
i was a little disappointed that the lake erie perch came breaded rather than beer battered as i would expect from a joint full of beer
the serving was really really small
this is my goto place for neat finds a good sandwich at lunch and a special treat now and then
so we ended up ditching tao the free drinks and our free table twenty minutes into the night to head to hakkasan
me and the wife had pulled pork sammy brisket bologna pot salad mac n chz corn bread and baked beans
kinda embarrasingbut im willing to suck it  up bc gosh it was amazing
the waiters and waitress are always smiling and keeping the drinks filled up when we sneak off to grab more food
le personel est trs aimable et acceuillant
again i was so hungry that i sucked it up and ate two slices
also their hot green tea is the best in town hands down
we are locals and finally made a date night to eat here
granted the salmon was big i couldnt finish it but i didnt bother taking it home because i had no sides like i was supposed to
whent there tonight at 405 pm for dinner and became the first in line
the cavatappi pasta used in the mac and cheese was the perfect noodle choose for the flavorful and gooey cheese sauce that was on top of it and i really enjoyed it especially whenever i got some turkey sausage in a bite as well
whoever the owner istarget sells them for like 10
red square is for sure one of our favorite destination when we come to las vegas
another coworker got this tuna crossiant sandwhichnext time ill try that
this place is so gross and dirty the sneeze guard was dripped with water from it being so steamy
stuffed them in a cooler and brought back to chicago
first impressions mean a lot
we had to explain to manager and waitress about 7 times
nett fr grssere gruppen
the food was good
the restaurant was spacious unlike a lot of other ramen shops around the area but alike most yelpers experience here the language barrier was strong despite their attentiveness
they have no ground pork or meat in the dishpurely a vegetarian dish with frozen mixed vegetables
the servers have very thick japanese accents so make sure you pay close attention to what theyre saying
i dont understand why restaurants can invest in filtered water
i would have preferred pita bread with my dip its available separately but realized a bit too late the chicken was flavorful and tender the rice was cooked well and the fries were quite more like thick crisps
by far the best bbq in the area
everyone in our group described it as just ok
great place for dinner and a movie
i would definitely come back for drinks but not for food
we arrived before our friends and saw the c rating health card posted at the counter but obscured from view behind some freestanding advert plaquards
sorry could  not recommend and will not return under any  circumstances
people were enjoying themselves
freshly made bread on all of their items on the menu and meat that melts in your mouth along with the cheese and perfectly married sauce
i ordered a chai tea latte and it was delicious
food was phenomenal
the food is always tip top but today the service is what was truly shined
i could get better pho in chinatown
stop along the way to chicagogreat pizza and cookie with ice cream very nice place and waitress
loved the grilled caesar salad
das fleisch war auf den punkt gebraten und war himmlisch zart
she barely greeted us
great selection for wing sauce
weder die auf ingwer gedmpfte barbe an curryfenchel welche nun nicht mehr auf der karte steht noch die spaghetti mit garnelen oder die maultaschen haben mir gut geschmeckt und waren qualitativ wie man es von mvenpick erwartet
we ordered how to look for a spot to sit
what is nino daversa
now the steak
definitely a go to spot for some cheap but delicious tacos
i dont get it
cooking is just not for himher
seriously what was i thinking
we tried takeout from brown sugar thai last weekend
he helped me order a wingorito with inferno sauce and it was awesome
the fried mozzarella was good but only 3 in an order for 799
this place offers a hawaiian take on sushi
we shared a thai beef salad with cucumber shitake mushrooms and tomato with thai chili vinaigrette that was out of this world fantastic
they make the barbecue sauce inhouse as well as everything else far as i can tell and lay it on thick
ended up going to bar for self service also filling up our own water glasses
i ate at town hall for the 10th or 11th time in 6 weeks and i have to say that that at lunch time it is a great place to meet clients and get work done
although i havent had the chance to try them our other dining mates raved about the breakfast quesadillas two crisp flour tortillas filled with scrambled eggs sausage green peppers onions and melted cheddar cheese  served with house made salsa sour cream and scallions and the stuffed french toast thick french toast slices stuffed with sweetened cream cheese and topped with strawberries and blueberries
i had the wings this time
the people at chipotle just totally made my day
when the warm weather comes this is going to be our come to place to hang out and relax with friends  family
this place was not goodeven if given the choice to be in any category
everything is homemade by the owner helena and tastes great
sometimes you find yourself in a whirlwind romance especially with a new found lover
chourico on the bun is great though quite expensive for the bun used
satisfied my craving for chinese food
at around 3am on a wednesday after a great time on the strip was heading back to the hotel and i was hungry
the sausages  are great and the perogis in 3 different types are great
she led us through the main dining area which was packed with a table of 10 or so people who were clearly enjoying themselves toward the rear of the restaurant and into a smaller back room
the texture was soggy misshapen and after one sip i wanted no more
sorry little shrimpies but you are too yummy
this is an extremely satisfying meal every time
then sashimi they do not skimp on this one  all and all it was really fresh and really delicious did wish my takosu was a bigger portion but can complain at the quality
there are some classy college humor signs on the wall including such gems as no shirts shoes skirt no problem
may give it another chance to see if our visit was a fluke
food was good but the service could of been better
the patio was empty as we entered the bar at first and after we waited for an hour the host walks around asking people who were waiting if anyone would like a patio seat
absolutely to die for
only downside i can say is we had a lot of difficulty of grabbing someone attention and being forgotten it took over half an hour to finally finish paying
services was customary down to earth yet sufficient
thats exactly what we got
we went here for dinner before the traditional dinner rush started
no flavor at all
thats not to say he didnt look the part he simply lacked the refinement one expects from a restaurant of this nature
then move on the specialty meats
absolutely looking forward to going back
however if youre menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding
not sure why everyone probably has the same opportunity to get these version from whoever their supplier is but they dont so these are the best
thats what the server said anyway so not sure it holds true for all their dishes
i was in the right parking lot but literally watched the red dot on my phone map and drove around trying to line it up with the green one
ohhh lets not forget lazy
i am upset with management because he was impossible to get ahold of and didnt even try to call us back to book this party
this is your typical az korean ownedrun sushi  asian fusion quantity over quality sushi joint
la passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their facebook page then go and grab a classic whiteclothed candlelit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering glutenfree or whole wheat pasta
simple easy to nav menu with something for everyone
it was cold and delicious
comfy chairs at the tables
i order the pad thai with beef and lemon pepper wings
i have to say that the display is great
the waitress never brought our drinks to us
i love spicy food and its hard for me to find a place that has salsa that is spicy enough for my taste buds that is until i found this amazing place
eh not too impressive
she was the bomb
if youre going to drink there be sure to eat elsewhere
hands down the best hakka food in richmond hill
when kevin brought our check he had changed the way we ordered to save us some money
we then ordered the halftray pizza
skin was very nice and crispy but hard to cut with the knife i was given
it was tender
three people put in 20 another a 10 and three people asked her to charge 17 a piece on their credit cards
amazing taste and ingredients
my dad had the burger and it looked and tasted great
5 stars are given based on the quality of the mealwhich is superb and i think you will like it
we started with debris and a giant wedge saladfinished with scallops and a giant mashed potato all incredible
i have always wanted to head to craftsteak but was too slow in nyc now that its collichicco and sons
eggs are perfectly cooked and the ciabatta is a great compliment to any meal
to take a step away from the more authentic mexican places weve been eating lately we decided to try out salsas which is more towards the americanized style of mexican food
i dont think its food poisoning but i think there is something in the taco that just doesnt agree with me
its not that i didnt like my ball i loved it it was great but i wanted to keep it less complex so i recommend just putting on two seafood items
there was a large group of us and we did the party package
we were quickly brought menus and a drink menu
since our family motto is go big then go home this was followed by double harry burgers half a pound of meat
today i stopped at the ihop off of exit 25 on i77 just to celebrate an excellent job interview that i just had looking for new job
when i told him that we are waiting for 20 min he said that someone well be with us shortly by pointing at another guy while avoiding eye contact with me i talked to him and he said that we are busy and there is nothing that he can do and we have to wait another 20 min just to place our orders  we obviously left
we will definitely visit again next time but you better believe that i will be prepared with a ninja grip on my dog and a death stare for my hubby
the burger came with tomatoes and lettuce and was glistening and juicy and oozing and beautiful
i will not be coming back
with the sides we fed 4 adults
the way it works is you order first then find a table then when your buzzer goes off you go pick up
would love to come back if i ever get the chance
the atmosphere and decor are nice for a toronto queer bar and the music tends to be pretty good
i came here for their proteins not the greens and decided on the build your own custom meal
we ordered the gyro tacos and were blown away with freshness and flavor
best italian food in vegas
i used to love this family owned business
romantic contemporary decor
pretty good hawaiian bbq place
i ordered at the bar and had a beverage in the interim while i waited for my pizza
the jet gave me free reign for his lunch
i took my philly back  asked for a refund
the price was right and we had a teammate who was a high roller at this casino
we love this place
also provided catering for this event with setup and referred a person for us to use for setupservingdrinks throughout  was perfect daughters first birthday  trilevel elmo cake  also perfectly done worked with both of the owners on these two separate events personally  always accessible and both go abovebeyond to make your eventneeds feel like their number one priority occasional needs  holidaysspecial occasionsetc
alles hat gut geschmeckt und die preise sind absolut gnstig
beyond this the cocktail list is short but wellcurated and the overall pricing for the food and beverages is quite reasonable its cheaper than indie ale house thats for sure
they were both excellent
ok  i admit im not from chicago  so maybe i just dont get chicago style pizza but what is up with squarecutting a round thin crust
the most memorable dish for me was the scallop served on its own shell in a broth that was probably the most naturally sweet scallop i have ever tasted even better than topnotch sushi restaurants like matsuhisa
their almond croissant was decent
their tofu bibimbap was awesome
tucked away in the back of a building is a hidden gem
they are always friendly and they never seem irked if i ask for a sample
every time i get out of this place its like im going to explode
obviously that is why there were absolutely zero customers in your restaurant
they were soooo delicious
my favorite ones are the chicharon putok batok lol
die kinder bekamen nicht nur eine extra speisekarte sondern auch das essen zuerst und ein lolli war auch noch drauf
the staff is usually as friendly unless you get them during the club rush at 3am
before i even read any prior yelp reviews about this place we had a discrepancy with our check
there are much better ayce place out there
i could go on and on but just go there and try it
so i was left with fried squash fried okra and sweet potato casserole
as with any bar and being a woman i have to note that the bathroom is tucked in the back with limited stalls
my plate was completely empty
taste was good but really skimped on the ingredients
we had the mahi sandwich chicken alfredo pasta and the cocktail special 2 for 1 and everything was great
i had a wisco 75 cocktail
the good   it seemed pretty popular
your server offers you drinks and eventually brings the food
sols menu is not a lot but i like their home cooking style of dishes
we had dinner at campania last night
nice misters on the fringes of the covered patio to help with the heat
all in all it was an awesome time and i loved it
freeze some of it and use the rest as you wish
the lady was nice and after getting our drinks pretty much left us alone
or my own could i have more lettuce than that
again not bad and price point was good
then we had this dish that was like a deconstructed sandwich
go somewhere else
the chips came to the table quickly but they were not fresh chips bagged and colored variety
meal comes with texas toast which is good too
if they arent you really dont get your moneys worth
go with the matzo ball soup with either a pastramibrisketcorn beeftongue
one of the better phillys ive had
as renowned as the sandwiches are i was disappointed to find them to be all bread
perfect place for lunch or even dinner cause the portions are huge
quiet atmosphere business casual amazing wait staff and bartenders
i want to go back to try other specialty sushis
my gold standard for sandwiches is meat  bread in vancouverand this place is right up there
the price was extremely reasonable as well with the whole burger at just 899
saw great reviews but its fairly decent
to start off go in and order
but at just 15 it was both a great value and a meal
there are a few binders filled with old memories from chicago for you to look through but i think there were all just black and white printing from online
my son got the amazing pork
the show was great the dinner was amazing the service was on point very print and we had lots of selections
the quality of the meat was excellent
we are paying for an experience not just a meal
my parents come here all the time and sit at the bar
i also tasted my wifes meatloaf sandwich
probably eat it off the ground
a mustgo for locals and visitors alike
their banner hangs way low and you have to duck under it to enter
alright now listen if youre ever going to share a steak with someone order the porter house you will not regret it
defiantly coming back
montreal deli also serves other sandwiches chicken fish blt peameal bacon homemade burgers and others and breakfast eggs toast smoked meat peameal bacon and others
from what we saw our choices were bbq mexican and hot dogs so we decided to go with bbq
i wish i could get my 20 back and erase this experience from my memory
lolas is its own separate house and theres plenty of seating
we were surprised by a gift from the chef which seems to be automatic for everyone of three small cups of french fries fried in duck fat along with a few different sauces
if i could give this 35 due to the coffee and the waiter i would
im not a big fan of that
the clam ratio however was perfect
went here with my girlfriend tiffanie who wrote the review below mine lol
ingredients were very fresh especially the good selection of veggies
i dont like food on the bone but i will eat it here
good value for the money
and served with fritos
love love love this place
and their wings are also very good original sauce is excellent albeit not cheap
perfect so you wont overdo it
the lemon dressing was to die for
so i chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the yaki udon noodle entree with tofu
gives me asthma and ruins my appetite
thumbs up for having brussel sprouts but they didnt taste right
preislich ist die qq sushi lounge auch sehr empfehlenswert vor allem bei der zentralen lage in stuttgart
they smell like some strange candy
if youre looking for a place to treat your parents la castile is likely a perfect choice
i should have kept going bc my order was completely wrong  the fries were so salty and my french toast was soggy
anyone in vegas should try this place
we will definitely be back
went with my husband last night
we sat up by the front windows and it was perfect
maybe if youre willing to hoof it its ok but not in 110 degree weather
snow slush snow yogurt slush and etc
all of them were very friends and social
frozen margaritas and sangria both very good
i read a lot of negative reviews about bad service here and you know me i complain a lot about service but dude they were pretty good that night
this isnt the case
i know im going back
like you go to a food truck or taco stand to pay less than a restaurant
i think i may have finally found my favorite beverage
we had the titanic which was gigantic
best part of the meal was dessert
another 15 minutes pass and the food arrives and she starts chowing alone and then our waiter starts chatting her while she drinks and eats alone leaving a bite of the burger left
concept looks great and looks inviting but just had the tuna and wasabi sandwich from the readyto go station and the bread was hard
eat at your own risk
so happy to have something other than a chain restaurant here in surprise
i drove an hour to take my wife here for her birthday yesterday
it wouldnt reflect well on the business if it wasnt good
tables start off at 300 reaching up to 1800 for a cabana which the club suggested we get since we had 8 people
ive also sampled their chicken tostada for lunch which was also excellent but the burrito is special
the only reason im not giving this place 5 stars is because they try to charge you extra for take out boxes and they dont have that listed on the menu and dont mention it to you before you order the large size bowl
will definitely be coming back if we are ever near the borgata
worst customer service ever
the food here is very typical of a chain restaurantsports bar
rule 1 dont touch my beer
the mashed potatoes were dense but softened well when mixed with the bbq sauce from the chicken
i once waited 20 min for a drink when they werent even busy
they made our evening
the older decor though theyre constantly making small renovations gives it a very homey sort of feeling and makes you very comfortable
its an interesting choice because the fish was one of the tiniest portions of salmon i have ever been served
small order of the cheese fries for an app which are my absolute favorite
we went on a whim for a casual saturday night out
the restaurant is cozy and relaxing and really gave me a comfortable experience
their special was a pork chop with jalapeno creamed corn which was my favorite part of my dinner
i specifically stated that i only wanted a slight pink not red raw  bloody
best part was the service leah she was fast efficient and friendly
spoke to the waiterswaitresses who just shrugged us off multiple times
highly disappointed in this place
never left unhappy
came here reading the other yelp reviews and chef john met my highest expectation
i looked like i had just been cut from the rocky horror cast and yet i still sucked that soup like ive never had it so good
i loved the cheese plate offering we did a tasting of 3  i should have been more adventurous on the third choice10 year aged cheddarbut i didnt know what a lot of the cheeses were i love cheese but am no expert and the server wasnt the most helpful when we explained we didnt know what to choose
really good to cut through the sweetness of the pancakes hash browns  crispy potatoes cant go wrong
the food was awful
sure its an older building but the place seemed really clean the bathrooms were well kept and heres the bonus  they got the long fountain  fish pond working and filled with fish and turtles
i gave this firefly only three stars because every time i have been thereand i continue to go back because i love their tapasi have never once been disappointed with my orders and the sangria is yummy too
maybe ill try the sahara location who knows
i appreciate the locally grown food but from my experiences no pasta special that included bacon shavings as the main protein should cost 26
i think i just had the best wings ever anywhere
they do not have soda as 2 liter but hey smiths is right there by cicis the management is very nice as well as the young lady that rang me up
the bottom bun on my burger was soggy when i received it
i typically order extra egg rolls with extra mustard  the twice cooked pork i  also love the cold coconut and lemongrass sake
all in all i left unsatisfied with the food but at that price what can i say
prices could be better
it was not a pleasant experience from start to finish and i will not be returning
this is the kinda place where if you have good company its a great place
when i was here one was playing a sports channel and the other was playing tvo kidsbut there were no kids inside the restaurant lol
cocktails oh when i went for dinner they had a bartender doing some fun cocktails and it is interesting they can bring some of the san francisco style cocktail culture to the mill avenue area
i will never return to this place and hope that others feel the same way
i was also worried that someone else would get her tip although she had done most of the work but there wasnt much i could do about it
the blue crab soup beef wellington complimentary bread and toffee dessert were definitely the highlights
awesome red chili great little local place with good food and decent service
the platter had 2 ample sized pieces of fish so youll walk out full
the manager vernice and her staff of summer brittany shelbie and stephen worked their tails off to make sure that all 50 of our guests had a wonderful night
it was busy but not packed enough to receive subpar service and food
ordered a large pepperoni and fettuccine alfredo with chicken to go for family dinner
i should learn from past experience that when i force him to order something other than what he wants that his dish is always better
i looove grimaldis
i like rare anyway but not what i had asked for
this isnt the one he went to either as another naked city pizza presumably the original location is on the other side of the strip in the back of a dive bar on arville
but if you really want sushi etc
i ordered the oc benedict
i would recommend their outdoor dining area
ordered delivery from the via uber eats first time using this service in brampton and wow what a crap experience
a cup was plenty and a super value at about 4
the place smells like farts too
not a place to throw on the lumberjack plaid and roll over to the bar for budweiser ew anyway
food wise they serve vegan food which is a pleasant change after a weekend indulgence of massive poutine
my rack of lamb arrived with about six bones
avoid at all cost
it was rich in flavor and very satisfying
the falafel sandwich was bland
that being said wicked spoon surprises and delights on many fronts
the hash brown were a little mushy and bland
been here a couple times for food average at best
thats where this is tough  over salted  way over salted
so to sum up the food was better than in a food court it was almost as fast as in a food court and the price was cheaper than in a food court
in the last couple of months though i dont know if its my perception or my love of a deal but the pizza hasnt been half bad
they gave me some pita bread along with it
i went in there to satisfy my pallets and all i got was a modified version
butin a pinch its a decent place to go to watch a game
i have to say that i was terribly disappointed in the foodespecially for the price
i refuse to eat there myself
i like pubs but this place has a classier feel to it
it was frosty almost like a slushie but still had such a delicious tea essence to it
in two days he had a proposed design for me which i loved with body accents and some shading for the wheels
we love the wings and the beer selection
i dont mean to say this attitude is coming from the people there
i also really liked all the sauce choices they had available
good music laid back great staff
sea bass was very salty  fish was fresh
we ordered chocolate cake for our dessert
pizza was delicious
the place is called memphis championship bbq  when you walk in there are  huge trophys everywhere you look with shiny gold pigs on them
i would absolutely visit here again and highly recommend this establishment to others
food was great alsolettuce wraps were yummy good veg stir fry
just dont order any taco they are badly made and not sure why the waitress was very nice and describe the food well she did not recommended the taco next time i would try the short ribs or their speciality pork belly
quickly grabbed a seat scanned the quite large menu and the 3 of us ordered drinks  food
the lunch menu seemed smaller than i remember they did have daily specials all of us had the platter a fried cornucopia of shrimp scallops and fish with two sides we all had the waffle fries and cup of clam chowder for 125 more well worth it
luckily i have received a request to find some place to eat for five of us me and four other men i thought women got all the blame for indecisiveness
i saw multiple things that seemed good but ended up having the chicken pad thai which was delicious
barely any cheese and could have used more types of breads or crackers not tiny pretzel sticks
you cant go wrong with 2 different happy hours
still love their food and would definitely come back
from far it just looks like a dome of arugula
the gravy from the links is great with the corn bread
they need to lower their prices and improve their waiting time
panda express is so much better
good to eat when drunk
i will definitely stop here again next time im in town
the tortilla chips and dips were the best
ocean trout was stringy
this is one of those places that you pay a little more for but while enjoying your splurge you find yourself repeating wow so worth it
too much bullshit
for instance when we were asked what we would like to drink they were told that everyone wanted tea
the food was a major disappointment
went last night with some friends and the food was delicious
what will bring us back however will be the ghost pepper burgerlooks dangerous and at 2400 im sure it is to both the mouth and wallet
customer service has dwindled quite a bit
after taking our order she just walked away
the iced tea tasted like the instant kind nestea
they always leave red sauce off and have to go back and ask for red
need to make a trip sometime soon
the only downside was it was a little chilly in there
there were two other tables there with white patrons
i think they have the best drinks in champaign and no competition really measures up to what big grove offers
on our last visit angelica took a few minutes to dialogue with us about five guys and discuss our guest experience during our current visit
she said it looked different and didnt taste good and mentioned this to our server who suggested she tell the manager
if it werent for the very expensive price tag this would definitely be a place we would frequent more often
i just remember the oysters were super fresh the clam chowder was amazing
we sat near their front window
didnt like it much wont be going there again
service here is definitely spotty
it was a banana cream pie but it didnt taste like it was real banana cream it tasted like that custard sweet stuff and the whip cream was definitely not real whip cream
toppings it was average my pie was not uniform so some spots had more than others
i did enjoy the seasoned oil and bread probably a little too much but definitely the highlight of my meal
everything comes with potatoes lots of potatoes
i love bassett
the chicken was not try at all
its cheesy with a crisp thin crust
your going to want to grab an order of rice balls truffle fries clams casino tagliatelli and a veal parmigiana and a glass of barolo
their customer service was amazing
we ate here for the first time in aug 2012 after cabo closed
i thought it was fine
4 of us enjoyed an amazing meal last night
1010 this is the best pizza you will find on campus
cant miss here for lunch or dinner
the food was amazing and the service was very nice and friendly
the chinese food was horrible
this is a beautiful restaurantdelishopwine bar
great coffee huge selection of crepes and friendly staff make this cozy independent cafe as good as a strip plaza joint can be
the food leans on mexicanesque dishes and affordable prices
the first order i picked up was a specialty pizza the piazza deluxe and garden salad with cheesevery good light on the sauce and reheats extremely well its hard to find a piece of pie that taste good reheated but this one does
the restaurant decor is great also
how very nice
the pork tenderloin was juicy and flavorful
my knowledge of hawaii is very limited but if i wanted to expand on that there are plenty of surfculture magazines scattered about the table
chicken was perfect juicy yet not greasy one bit
im partially to blame for this twothree star review
one of the things i miss most about being vegetarian is pepperoni pizza
hands down i got the award for the most amazing plate at the table
b  but you dont have any food in your fridge
not sure if i would go back
i know its little off the beaten path from the strip it is so worth it
also the sushi chefs are getting worse
dishes are clean and service is efficient
a nice lady who we presumed was the owner came and inquired of our satisfactiom a few times
the greek salad was ok not quite as good as i remember
soup salty and cold
definitely a cultural difference with that
the service was good
directly connected to a cool donut shop if youre craving an unhealthy dessert to top of your healthy meal  very professional friendly staff
best bread anywhere
i ordered 3 sandwiches pulled pork cuban and brisket and some potato salad
no big deal i picked up my fork and grabbed two small fork fulls of caesar salad off his plate
the overall price was a tad expensive
i was extremely pleased with my experience at the downtown crown
it took a couple of times of trying for the phone call to be answered so i knew they were busy
service  our waitress was attentive and and helpful
perhaps too amazing because they last time we went on monday the happy hour is switched to 2 sliders with no option or brats
the wings were shrivelled  kind of like chinese food in a way where they batter and fry up chicken pieces that are sliced thin and then cover with sauce
from someone who has spent hundreds of dollars here i have to sayto the pong pong owners maybe you know you are on your way out and thinking retirement since rio salado college bought the property if not you need to crack the whip and get your restaurant and its employees back into shape
seriously the best mexican food in town
this is a las vegas gem
decor could use some updating
i am visiting montreal for the first time and somehow happened upon this restaurant
udupi is a place checking out when you are in toronto
ah elias and his infinite wisdom
they hit the mark righton with the enchilada and taco but the tamale is soso
i havent had a large sandwich yet app
they do have these items on the menu available for ala carte purchase but something just doesnt feel right about that set up
on days when you dont want to feel stuffed for hours on end its a great option
we ordered the crab thick noodle and the roasted lemongrass chicken on noodle
coffee was delicious
enjoyed a delicious dinner at the improper pig last night
as i said you cant compare the okinawa style ramen and the other more mainstream ramen joints as their styles are different
i dont think too highly of paying over 15 for undercooked chewy meat and pasta topped with an underwhelming bland tomato sauce mine was tortellone alla piemontese his was the fettucine de farro httpbitly1jhfmfl
huge menu very friendly service and def a local favorite for is now
i am actually very impressed with this place
i remember looking over at a couple who had ordered 3 items and were finished their meal
i walked over to chipotle
the vibe is priceless and they have good beer
best pizza in town
it was just a hunk of meat with cheese
so we came here on a sunday for lunch and the owner was surprised that we found the place since most of the plaza around us was closed
without much direction i send an email with my order
the chicken katsu was horrible as well super thin cold just didnt taste freshly prepared
i been going to this place for almost 3 years an i always get the steak an eggs soo good a great place to bring ur family too it gets pack on weekends but it worth waiting
they close at 3 am so you have plenty of time to get there after a night out
we were led through the restaurant to this great back patio that had some tree coverage and felt very cool despite the summer heat
highly recommend for special occasions or to be pampered
ill be back for the donuts and to maybe try a fancy new cocktail
i then asked him if the beers were just light colored or dark colored and he said he didnt know
the owners just seem like really fabulous people who genuinely care about their product using their artistic taste freedom the people that they serve and the satisfaction of their customers
we couldnt help but eat off all the plates but did not dare attempt to finish a single one in this sitting
to summarize i dig what they are doing here in a very big way and i think you would dig it too
love this place
the sausage platter said its assorted but it kind of looked and tasted the same to me
das essen cheesburger mit wedges 14 der cheesburger war lecker besonders das fleisch
i would say this is the best chinese food i have ever had in the us i travelled with friends in different cities along west coast as well as in arizona and utah for two weeks
i was actually a little concerned that some corners would be cut because we were rushing but it was pure perfection
we had an entertainment book coupon so we decided to check it out
kudos to the manager and staff they are always so friendly and upbeat
i also didnt appreciate the server not taking responsibility for her mistake and then putting the issue on us while we were trying to enjoy our limo ride back to the strip
for a value price
i did not notice a dish being too greasy
when theres a good broth its such a shame to not have bread to dip in it
casual atmosphere good service
overall i liked the meal
is this place still open
i started with the club and tried the all american on the 2nd visit  both awesome but the club was better
my wife had taken some medication and i specifically informed the waiter
i also requested lettuce and tomato for my burger
it was on the pricey end for asian food but had interesting twists to traditional asian food
most women dont eat ribs because they are too messy
thats because shes new here referring to the first waitress
the cut was juicy and had just the right amount of pink
the frosting was very creamy and the cake was moist and delicious
we check the times online and it says theyre open til 1230am
depending on what you like the price can escalate quickly
veggies green peppers and onions are free but they wont ask if you want it youll have to be explicit
surprisingly it wasnt very busy
finally the food wow
table  chairs were dirty
we also had the tasty seabass skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate happy birthday written on it for the birthday girls
i was expecting more spice from the shrimp
prices are very reasonable
when he did take it out from the back  he looked at the plate for moment
being hungry i finally said whatever to myself and continued to watch
one of my favorite lunch spots on the east side
thankfully right then the little brother walked in and we didnt have to deal with her anymore
would much rather stick to the rays pizza on 59th and greenway
when we initially walked in we were greeted and seated very quickly
this place was highly recommended by my new friend who is korean
we like to order it pretty spicy but you can get it really mild too
the service was okay and given how small the menu is i expect the staff to know the ingredients of the menu items which wasnt the case
our food  service was great
worst venue ive ever been to
for 6 i wouldnt bother
no apologies when it was found
still chewy and delicious but definitely not your classic yellow ramen
wife and i drove up from tucson to visit a friend
we were there so long that we felt like wolves when we received a plate of small bites
enjoyed some live music while eating a delicious pizza the cal italian
there are like 30000 italian restaurants with good food
back to the cioppinoa bit pricey for the amount of seafood but it was one of the best and memorable dishes ive had in a long time  i eat out often
great bar atmosphere here
and i really wish i could come here again but i do not think as a company that serves and makes food they train their staff to fully understand and be careful with people with allergies
fridgin awesome yakiniku type spot with a 17 all you can eat deal on select daystimes
back to the cobb salad
definitely shouldve gone for steak and mushroom instead
needless to say the puzzled patrons just walked out
i had the sole
is it even possible to finish one of these
this place is great
but my friends each liked different cuts so it worked out  ribeye is the fattiest
dann kommt noch dazu dass eine halbe dicke 480 kostet und der preis der ja schon wucher ist noch nichtmal in der karte ausgewiesen ist
burger finally arrived and it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for the 45 mins
way too much money i wont order from there again
soup definitely made fresh
it was much more mild but provided a big punch of flavor
even though there is a wait its not long at all
we enjoyed the calamari we opted to have the herbed and it was excellent
she looked dumbfounded and walked away as we watched her approach a young man at the front of the restaurant
i ordered a hennessy on the rocks just to compliment the meal
my wife enjoyed the seafood trio which was the special of the night
we decided to take a seat outside but even there tvs hanged on the walls and people were watching them without paying attention to the food
the service is great and the owners are very nice
beim rechnung bestellen das gleiche spiel
i dont expect the same prices here
we enjoyed the brunch prix fix menu 1 bloody mary grilled sticky cinnamon roll with baconbutter sauce and smoked lamb huevos ranchero with goat cheese and salsa verde
glad to have stopped by this barbecue place right off the freeway
perfectly cooked lightly breaded and yum capers
again who does this kind of service and communication
i couldve easily ordered and finish two more plates
overall this place is not all that it could be but the food is solid and it is worth stopping in if you are in the neighborhood
i ordered a few chicken yakitori and some veggie fried rice
my favorites are the peppercorn burger and the hubert burger
the flatbread had amazing flavour but its a bit much for two people
food was surprisingly delicious
walked right in on a wednesday around 1030 had our choice of seating
harrira soup is a must have
you only get one piece of pork with your ramen now
been here twice
meh is a good word or sound
our desserts were also really amazing
but one thing i love about yelp is the different places you find
we were here end of june and paid 60 per person for not very memorable food
the crepe itself was very delicious and i loved the pancake usually its too rubbery or salty or something is just off about it
service was good by both
nothing like louisiana but pretty good
food was delicious generous and priced fairly
nice atmosphere and friendly service on top of everything i just listed so we will definitely be back
if you are over 40 this place is a pleasent throwback to a time when this setup was common
for me personally their food yesterday was a 3 star at best
then calling it an ultimate veggie burger
others has the seafood pasta and risotto dishes
i agree with a prior review  las vegas is lucky to have this restaurant
this is definitely not a place for the tight walleted
good junk for the stomach
when it comes to the food i remember sharing a chicken sandwich with my friend
mood is one part hiptwoyearsago one part strip mall location and one part coal miner attitude assuming coal miners are generally grumpy and selfpreservation involved and dont care too much about kitchen discretion
this place has helped us to realize that we need to explore cleveland a bit more
make circles  not julienne slices   after all these years california hotel has treated me well
the chicken was spicy and savory garnished with a little orange peel shavings
i came by for breakfast and it was great quality food especially for a buffet
some may find it pricey but having been to budgetfriendly ayce places i can assure anyone the quality difference makes up for the higher price tag
one of the best chinese food places in scarborough
we started off at the bar and had a margarita
been by it on the canal trail for the past decade but never stopped in until recently
i love food here
the restaurant feels like home the wait staff is generous but most importantly the quality of the food is amazing
now to the food
a pittsburgh favourite and mine as well
i was initially delighted that the shrimp topping seemed to be mounted onto a fried chinese cruller   cut lengthwise  how creative
the focal point were the huge projection screens in both sections for your viewing pleasure
so be careful
the cuban sandwich was pretty authentic as the owners are from cuba
we wanted to try this place since it was so close to our house
they had a juke box playing also
i never used to mind this part since i used to believe this was a hallmark of authenticity but i do wish the shrimp tails didnt contain their shells
all were a hit
they let me wait forever
love everything abou the place minus the fact that cocktails should be better and the food wayyy better
cant wait to go back
they offered only had about 8 entrees 2 soups 6 misc of salad fried shrimp chips fried banana fried curry pouches apple slices and orange slices and thats it
the best part are the few pieces of beef that were seared too long making them extra crispy
betjningen var den bsta jag ngonsin haft i srklass
why 1 star
i called last night and was told scott g the general manager would call me back
it is oknothing special
the curry squid and pork intestines were also very fresh and very tasty  squid in particular can sometimes be way too rubbery but it was just right at golden court
will definitely be coming back here the next time im back in phoenix
they had no problem with it
i want to keep coming here because the food is really good but if this keeps up i dont see this place lasting when saffron is down the road
make your order get the little table number thing and then wait for your delicious food
i had the chicken gumbo absolutely the best gumbo ive had in a restaurant
juicy perfect amount of cheese and seasoning
the second thing was the same as the first
its located in new town in a fairly residential area so its in peaceful surroundings
had it not been that we had been traveling all day and were starving we would have sent the ramen or whatever that was back as well
do you have another form of id
the only knock is that the fish is ice cold when served not a bad thing since you know they are keeping it on ice its just a little off putting when you bite into a roll
order the kale saladto die for and i dont even like kale
we had a groupon for this buffet
we all enjoyed the thinly sliced pastrami and fresh delicious bread
also the burgers and wedge salad were great
we were looking for something quick and authentic
the design of the menu is problematic
they have a drive through too if you are short on time and like my self cant bring yourself to eat mc donalds or burger king this is a great alternative but probably still not the most nutritious place in the world
if i had to single out something for criticism its that the burger was rather small  all in all a vast improvement over the previous visit
the food is always perfect and the view of the fountains stunning
the only bad thing is the quality while i have had better sushi in phonix the price here is inexpensive
we got off the plane and while i picked up the rental car we also used the free wifi at the rental car terminal to find the nearest jitb
they would have gotten 4 stars anywhere else still very good but 5 stars for fort mill
pickle barrel if you want a better review youre going to have to stop dicking around your customers
overall the dish was nothing exciting
we ordered our food two all you can eat wings with fries buffalo shrimp six piece wings and a turkey burger
otherwise i will be making another trip to vegas soon
del taco right across the street was one of the first food comforts i had as a college student at unlv and also one of the reasons i gained the freshman 20 not 1520   i was such a lard
food is amazing
however the service was very confusing
we left without actually eating anything
ive never had the opportunity to sit in the latter area but it looks like fun
we travel a lot to vegas and always stay on freemont st  dennys is obviously a fast cheap meal and something we look forward to waking up to in the morning
checked in again
eggs benedict with smoked salmon was reportedly delicious as were the sausages according to my friend
the second time i had melt in your mouth trout gravlax with fresh greens
such a colorful  fun place
i got the linguinie and truffled mushrooms
we just wanted to enjoy the cool night
his coleslaw came in the same size container as the tarter sauce however they gave huge amounts of french fries and sweet potato fries
we also had the curd rice delicious like a savory rice pudding with mustard seeds and curry leaves and a number of northernstyle vegetable curriessaag aloo and cauliflower in cashew sauce were particulary good
good opportunities for people watching
the cast as a whole was pretty good but there were a handful of standout performers which i will attempt to remember
based on dim sum alone this place is 5 stars but the place was too noisy my  girlfriends and i could barely hear each other and it wasnt even their peak hours
it was not an inexpensive meal but your money is wellspent here as you get what you pay for
came here for a date night with the huz and im so glad we did
my husband had the steak and onions and it was excellent
we went to go return the food and get our money back
party of five
would i come back
the pizza was good too
however for a 125 omakase dinner i was expecting a bit more sashimi and sushi
30qm gross allerdings steht eine bar darin weshalb ca
they really hit you hard with the sauces i got 2 but only remember onewhich was the curry sauce  disclaimer  holy butts watch out cause their curry sauce is hot hot hot and im generally not a big baby with hot sauces but their curry sauce challenged my palette
we arrived midday looking forward to using our 5off coupon and having a terrific meal
the following review is specifically for the bungalow room type  these rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool
it now says rolling in the dough and chocolate and spice
the person wasnt even my server
i came to this location while waiting for some car repairs
its now been approximately 40 minutes since we ordered 2 bacon egg and cheese sandwiches and a order of french toast
i called several times and no one answered then when i  finally got through they said we could come in with no reservation
do not waste your time and money here
the fancy dessert coffe was amazing the food was amazing the candy store next door was even more amazing
the food was good and the service was very nice and not aloof at all
we ordered them medwell and medium doneness
my dreams were satisfied last night
the place was packed with a lot of people there we knew this place had to be good
they remind me of the fries i used to get at lunch in middle school
most of the empty tables were covered with messy dishes and food
im pretty sure that its the only good japanese restaurant in the general area and the best thing is that its price point is also pretty much the same as the other japanese places as well
their supplier is vienna beef and they even have the neon green relish
must give ws credit though for offering upscale items eg bone marrow blackened fish mac  cheese bar kale salad but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets eg pizzas breads teri chicken beef ribs potatoes etc
but the decor is nice and the staff is friendly and the food is good
the burger for entree which i ended up giving half to hubs because he did not care for his pasta dish
delicious food love the 6 tasty cocktails
everything fresh and with just a bit of a kick to it
it definitely has that speakeasy feel without the outrageous prices of one downtown speakeasy cough low lighting dark wood spacious
the other 2 times i have been there the chicken was cooked properly
how should i rate and yelp this place without being judge
pizza was amazing the crust was super crispy and the pepperoni and cheese was on point
this place is beautiful
delicious yet spicy cold seaweed app salt and pepper fried pork filets finish the meal w the corn pancake
i drank the whole bowl of pho soup and i felt fine afterwards when i came back home
didnt tell us that fried rice is 2 more and noodles are 3 more
she should open a waitress school
but i dream about this food
turn the music down
great service too the waitresses are very polite and kind
this is normal for me but i love pizza
they also have a large bar in the back of the restaurant so if you dont have a reservation you have a place to hang out while waiting
service is good and attentive too which can be unusual in a chinese restaurant
my friend was also accused of spitting on someone and was threatened to get kicked out by security until the real culprit was found
and for less than 10 its a total win in my book
compared to other joints theyre making it happen flavor and quality wise better
i go here almost every day for lunch
they have a ton of options and i was quite pleased and conflicted on my selections
the kung pao chicken with macadamia nuts packed flavor and a punch at the end
perfect light dinner
the place was outstanding in every way
and not to mention they are generous on their ingredients
ive always loved chick fil a ever since i first tried it in arizona
noah our server was very helpful and efficient the chef came to say hello and we had a wonderful experience
there are hardly any grilled vegetables on it and it has two slices of beefstake tomatoes
also our table was not ready when we arrived on time we waited for 20 mins to sit down when they told us about 1015 min wait since they were behind schedule
and their sweet and sour chicken tastes a lot different than other chinese restaurants but thats certainly not a bad thing
i dont play into the whole skinny blah blah blah so when i order a margarita or mojito i expect to get the calories
hot fresh delicious
there are however a couple items that need attention
great view great service and above all else great food
it was just like a loaded potato skin but with a waffle fry
definitely intended to be a takeout only kind of place
plain fries i think would be a 10 i like the ideas they have and being from the east coast not too far from philly i looooove philly cheesesteaks
pretty good pizza
lol i will definitely come again and next time try the mimosas sampler trio
not anything to write home about but hits the spot when you are cruising late night for a meal
why should i suffer or miss out on good food just because i choose to not eat meat
i remembered seeing this place pop up on yelp a few months ago and decided to check it out
honey pig is an ayce korean buffet but and its a big but
i am from back east these are hands down the best bagels i have tasted in az
but theres no excuse for a bad steak at a place with steak in the name and especially not at a michael mina restaurant
the first time i walked into this mcdonalds of japan was after a frat party at university of southern california
the croissant was so buttery and flakey
also you will need to wait for all members of yoru party to arrive before you are seatedeven if there is no one else in the dining room
needless to say he will definitely remember that dish
the staff was helpful  pleasant
my husband and i were looking for a good ramen place and we found so much more here
it was pretty good
tonkatsu noodles were good and the egg was good but you had to let it sit in the hot broth for awhile otherwise youd realize that they tossed a cold egg in there
although i was disappointed with the not so fresh bread and they didnt have any hoisin or siracha sauce the inside of the sandwich tasted yummy and fresh
it wasnt until around 700 that the line started to really get going
had a combo with beef tamale taco and a burrito which was pretty good but not awesome
these margaritas arent shy
the foie gras was amazing as well soft and melt in your mouth
so if you do eat the spicy foodto alleviate the paineat some belgium chocolate
not overpriced for a restaurant on the strip and great selection of beer
the falafel wrap was incredible so is the bean burger
one hidden gem they have here that i have never seen at other buffets is the bone marrow
my companion may differ  being not a fan of spanish food in general and feeling a little off that night  but i enjoyed everything i had here quite a lot
great atmosphere fabulous music the sweetest staff who all gave super service and the chance to sit by a window watching saturday kensington shoppers saunter by
lastly because brad cannot live without dessert he order the mile high cake
the waiters here are quick and efficient
i also ordered a spanicopita  hope i spelled it right  it had a nice flaky crust along with a strong spinach flavor
buffet is for salad desserts and yup the crab legs
i left hungry and will never go back
it is a ton of food and defrigginlicious
so glad we stumbled upon this place right down the street from our house
we received a text that our table was available so we went in and were seated outside
everything was delicious and with generous helpings
a frozen california kitchen pizza tastes better than that
my only complaint and its a small one is that the restroom is a single so there is often a line which is mildly annoying
rellenos are very good
prices are decent but as with many sushi places it is better to come during hh times
you asked me to be honestso here it is
the food serving was decent except for the salt and pepper calamari i can count how many were there in the plate
dont go the buffet route
there were two people working which is common from what i understand and they were fairly busy when we were there at dinnertime on a friday during lent and we still got our food very quickly
dont get me wrong about the night life here
highly recommend  ill be back
this place is truly deserving of a 5star rating
the northern california childrens hospital seemed to genuinely care about children and their families phoenix childrens hospital seems to care about money and fund raising
they use rashers
we were at the restaurant far too long because the service was so slow
i know some people who have worked there and from what i understand the owners know about this and overlook it
they didnt disappoint at all
the waitress noticed i wasnt making the most of my voucher as i wouldve had credit left and suggested we ordered something else which i really liked
visiting from california and found this place online
check it out only mex sushi place in town i know of
we ordered food and beer but we totally felt pushed and ignored
service was also quite slow and rude
take my word for it when i say you can never go wrong with a sandwich from here
this is a really tough review for me because ive never given two stars and because i am a huge fan of everything noda but a bad pizza is a bad pizza
why is it so difficult to make coffee the way the customer asks for it
i was hesitant to order it because of the whipped goat cheese i usually dont like it but the friendly and knowledgeable bartender talked me into it and im very glad i got it
it looked and felt like a top restaurant
its located in
the biscuits are all sugary and fluffy never burnt
great service good vegan food
service 05 atmosphere 05 food 355 im truly upset about the whole experience i had at this restaurant
sanfratellos uses very high quality ingredients including 100 scamorza cheese and yes it makes a difference
3 the appalling treatment by the managerialwait staff of who they clearly feel are third class customers left me feeling as though the place ought to be reduced to tinders but apparently someone has already tried it httpwwwblogtocomeatdrink200612sassafrazonfirenocelebsinjured
by the time we needed more hot water we were the only patrons left in the restaurant
on our way out i looked at their price menu theres no mention that drinks arent included and no pricing for drinks
dessert me chocolate cake with whipped cream on top boyfriend sorbet with chocolate shavings and meringue sticks verdict the cake had an almost mousselike texture which was delightful though rich which we expected
my steak tampiquea was perfectlycooked and seasoned and paired nicely with charred green onion on the hot flour tortillas provided
esp if you need more food to keep you awakeallow you to drink more got 3 x carne asada and 3 x adobaba tacos
if this place were inside the w per se it would inspire a chain of restaurants
we got an amazing table outside on the patio on the most gorgeous vegas day
clearly cafe rio doesnt have customer service training
happy dog rocks
this will be my new go to place for fine dining in a relaxing atmosphere
i prefer it this way so much more
the fireplace and couches were a nice touch for drinks
probably some of the nicest people youll ever meet making fast tasty food
the bar itself is smack dab in the center of the place and has seating on three sides it makes the bar itself feel like the most important part of the place rather than just a counter shoved against a wall like most bars
you would never think this combination would go together but it really works
the staff was so helpful and courteous it really made our night special
it was as if she was frazzled or distracted
other top picks are the bulgogi cheesesteak tempura prawns spicy scallion  avacado slaw which was not spicy thank god because i cant eat too spicy and the squash poutine
i had the butter chicken kathi roll and while maybe its not as flavourful as a roti ahem ghandi or burrito you cant help but compare id definitely return to try another one
the bananas seemed unripe and the peanut butter was crumbly
the real superstar at holsteins is their adult milk shakes omg to die for
if my wife didnt like the cheesecake i would never go
the atmosphere was great and the staff were extremely friendly
better last time
the thing i really want to talk about though is the wings
however despite being a new place their soda machine was broken or perhaps they just havent gotten it operational yet
hard rock rocks
but there were a few things that just didnt sit right with me
oh and the casino was nice but the cigarette smoke irritated my eyes and nose all weekend
four peaks hop knot on draft or san tan hop shock both great
creme brulee  im a creme brulee nut  this was the 2nd best ive ever hadthe first being at a  tiny restaurant in vail co  cons  the appetizers were inedible lamb miniburgers spicy chicken the dinner salmon was bland and overcooked the dinner tenderloin was anything but tender and overcooked
we were both queasy and nauseous from the greasy sides
it was very busy but i only waited a short time for a table
it was the perfect stop over on a long drive
should check it out once
on a wednesday evening at about 700 we waited over 10 mins to be greeted by a less than friendly waitress
i would have taken a box to go for the rest of my food but i was in walking distance to home and didnt want to carry it with me
also they have a crepe section but dont be fooled
the home made chilli sauce is kickass and you can buy jars of it at cash to take home  9 for a large jar and less for a smaller version
amazing  everything
afterwords i order the prime skirt stake and my wife orders the chicken
you have no idea how much i hate the food in downtown las vegas
besides the orange tofu there is not much on the menu that is good
awful place overall
finally we got the chicken picatta
had a burger fries and a soda and was pleasantly surprised
youll pay about the same price
the first bowl he brought out was hard and dry as hell
this soup is addictive and itll have you begging pho more
too bad it was a wednesday nightno matter ill be back and i definitely recommend checking it out
the peppers were very undercooked and still hard
with the icons of our generation flocking to this mega power club the lemming touristas followed blindly
that being said ive not been blown away either
i was lucky enough to be going to a dinner later that night and pulled these out for everyone to share afterwards
im salivating now
i got the eggplant oscar it was super pricey just like most of the entrees here
not great not terrible  the food here is pretty cheap but if you ask for anything extra theyll be sure to charge you
so along with the beautiful view of las vegas we got to enjoy watching people jump off of the stratosphere
rick steves says never eat anyplace with pictures of the food
the only reason i am giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the portion size and the price
i was a little skeptical since this is more of a sports bar than a fine seafood restaurantbut do yourself a favor and try them
the bbq chicken stick was well spiced and  tender
im giving this a four star mainly because of the ambiance
thats the only disappointment ive received
ill start with the good the happy hour drinks and the patio are pretty freaking awesome
you will not be disappointed plus you can catch dinner there before heading to your night on mill ave
i look forward to your reply
the view is great sitting right behind the bellagio fountains
plenty of fruit flies for everyone
i also had some shrimp ceviche which was amazing
it was just very sugary and watery
we will be back again
und der preis wurde dagegen sogar angehoben
the service was horrible and the food was bland
appetizers karaage was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside
it was extremely meaty fall off the bone tender
best sushi in charlotte
the soup was delicious with large chunks of white meat chicken and tasted wonderful
i cant wait to come back and try everything
service was okay
i ordered the tonkotsu shoyu ramen
i expect it al dente
we will definitely go back for the tacos
decor is interesting  with cartoons and caricatures of celebrities
good thing the food was good so it made up for the nasty taste i had in my mouth from that napoleon dessert
since this place looks like its going to be or continue to be the next big thing in vegas we should have at least 2 stalls for each sex in case one gets tied down
the server was friendly
dining in is a great idea as well as take out
so nice to have a cappuccino that did not taste like the usual burnt favor
the only reason for four stars is because the food here can sometimes be slightly oily at times
the restaurant itself is nice and clean
its great but to compare it to fast food i dont feel like they are the same level
tried the angry bird if you arent a fish person which is made with chicken and also builded my own with spicy tuna and yellow tail
originally a restaurant from orange ca that has expanded greatly and now hit the strip  this is a great faster stop to get fried chicken and waffles in a fun and new location and building
this is about the best chinese food ive tried around this area
the crepes are amazing
did i enjoy eating at the first and original congee queen
ive been here 3 times
we were taken to be seated at a table but doing so would have put us shouldertoshoulder and elbowtoelbow with the people at the tables next to us
we had 4 appetizers and their pineapple fried rice
if this is the best korean bbq you have had what places could possibly be worse
though i love going to west 50 for their enormous selection of beers i have to say out of all the beer houses i have been to this is definately the most expensive
in terms of nachos the way i measure how good a pub is id give them a 6 out of 10 which aint great but good enough when youre desperate for cheese
dont bother me while i get my crab legs on
if youre nearby you must check this place out
as you walk in you are not only met with a friendly welcome and all you can eat peanuts while you wait you also get to meet the meat in the fridge and see the cuts
dont come here las vegas one again
again a 92 come on guys
i  ordered the mixed greens which tasted fresh and the dressing was light rather than overpowering as most dressings seem to be these days
the outdated rundown interior is another
when you physically enter the location there is staff that runs around behind the counter with zero service training
but at least i can finally get this delicious pizza my friend talked about
heck i have never served time
i also enjoyed the biscuits served with a apple jam and green beans served with a light sauce with shaved almonds
and dont recommended anyone to go unless your looking for drama and poor service
it filled my hunger was under 5 and i didnt die afterwards
meat was tough and mainly got big pieces of fat with absolutely no meat
home cooked food
terrible tasteless food and an exceptionally rude staff
food and service was good
i like their food when im in the mood for a chain type restaurant
but is it a joint where im saying dude you gotta try this place out
the tiramisu is one of the lightest ive ever had
prices are right on for the food
i got a build your own burger which was ok but i think if i would have gotten one listed that had a lot of fixings it would of been amazing
then i get the salad with two little cups of dressing
the buffet itself looks great
the food is good though
needless to say a tip was not left
starter salsa is runny and bland
this 1 star review is solely on the service
atmosphere comfortable and eclectic
the tea was also good
and its relatively cheapthe lunch specials are cheap but yet the portions are large
we ordered the shrimp as an appetizer which came in a soft squishy sweet bun
we had beets with poultry liver sauce
i couldnt ask for more
to be honest i might be a bit bias here because i never liked chicken katsu don shocking i know
aber wir wrden positiv berrascht
definitely the best pizza place ive had in vegas so far
i had the chilli and salmon fishcake with fries and mushy peas
finally made it to cento after several recommendations
i have to admit i used my buddy philip ts review to adjust my dining choices
i put in everything i wanted im all about the sides
anxious to come back and try other things
pizza is ok no place to sit
the ribswere only ok
to greg and the rest of the good people at the rice paper i thank you and cannot recommend you enough
if you want to avoid the crowd and noises i advise you to visit the restaurant during lunch as the restaurant is usually packed at night
the side salad was a good sized portion of mixed greens which made me feel better about eating the curly fries
if youre looking for great food at a great place do not miss this
the waitstaff was very friendly and quick to offer their opinion on the menu when solicited
shanghai cuisine is quite unique and has a different taste yo most chinese food
along with the steak and mushrooms
we came from all over the valley from goodyear from chandler etc
our daughter has gluten allergies so this was the perfect dish for her
well definitely be back on our next trip to vegas
its covered in a very sticky sweetsourspicy sauce
i went in for lunch on sunday with my daughter and both of us were happy
decor very modern asian feeling full bar
just a good old school vegas hangout
the food is always awesome no matter what location i go to
im thinking of trying a meal other than breakfast perhaps an all you can eat spaghetti night with the five and six year olds in my life
the mere fact that they continue to receive poor reviews and their owner is aware of this and yet they still havent improved the food fascinates me
our entrees were a lot better
nice ambience especially for dates
i like most that i have tried but didnt like the red velvet one
the spinach artichoke dip with cashew cream is amazing and the french toast was phenomenal
walmart had a pgx promo and they would not bother to match
the draft list is pretty darn good and though i cant personally speak for the food my buddies enjoyed their wings maple bacon sriracha  yum
wife and i had a craving for sushi rolls so decided to visit yanagis
if you order a side of fries they will usually give you way more than you can eat
the key is to mix in the hot sauce and quickly mix everything together while the bowl still sizzles
a bit cramped
this place is my favorite place to go for a quick breakfast
this past visit i ordered the katsu don chicken
food was tasteless warm at best and i didnt know eggs could be that small
we ordered our drinks which did arrive promptly and then ordered dinner
on mondays it has a special ribchicken combo for just 15
they had a dinner package that included soup or salad a choice of entre plus dessertcoffee
im just aok about this place
presentation the papaya salad is good to share
stopped in for a quick drink with a friend early evening
delicious sushi incredibly priced
i asked her if there was a way to find out what is in it and she said no
maybe that happened maybe it didnt
too bad i was so full or i would have gotten another one
i really the place
theyre food is very eclectic sharing one thing in common its all raw vegan gluten free and cold
theyve done a great job with the decor and the ambiance inside its slightly rustic chic and not pretentious
flavor was on point for both
no other flavor mostly salt from the soy
prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get expect to spend 7 to 15 bucks
at time of writing the restaurant has recently moved down the street from its old landmark locale
the food is always very fresh and their sweet potato tots are to die for
i wish i ordered the tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasnt as salty but still pretty salty
it was a little early in the day around 1130 or so
he was just the right amount of friendly without being intrusive
i went around 2 or 3pm on a weekend for lunch and there was literally no one in the restaurant but us possibly because of the time period
they also have  a pretty good brunch too
jatwann is by far one of the best servers i have ever had
gp thank you for being so good to me
buck up kiddo  you can always work at the dmv
very good place overall
music played and seem to become louder as the evening progressed
that wasnt a huge surprise though considering the area of town
its 5 minutes from the airport
during the evening walk around harbourfront
price 25 around 40 per person if you get a main dish dessert and drinks
the kid rings up my order
we had baked clams topped with bread crumbs for the appetizer and it was good but just a tad salty
for about 4 or 5 visits i wouldnt order anything else didnt want to take the chance of somethinganything not being as tasty but the server recommended the red chili taco and damn was it good too
some old dude passed out twice here while trying to make it to the bathroom
you can overcome a bad food experience but not a bad service one  cant believe your related to citizen
my husband and i stopped by greka pita for lunch
it is a mediterranean restaurant
and the waitress was like get the most expensive wine for the best deal
order the tuna tataki
sauteed long beans honey walnut prawns chinese and mushrooms and fried sesame balls are my usual favorites at krazy buffet
ive been for dinner but this last time was about drinks and appetizers
it seemed more authentic than the other options
but all in all it was very faithful to the original hofbrauhaus
i also heard a customer request the french toast 2 hrs after breakfast stopped being served and they happily accommodated
volcano roll was a little sweet for my liking
the waiter said yes and the the head chef had left so the sous chef was i charge
you could tell they were organized by the way the staff entered and exited the kitchen
the food is always great and the bartenders are friendly new york roll is my favorite
prior military army vet owner thank you sir
this place was just such an amazing experience
my thoughts on the char siu pork sandwich was that overall it had good flavor but for some reason i was expecting pork belly and i really wanted pork belly
service was great
our family loves the combination lo mien beef and broccoli crab wonton
the price is a solid 4 stars too
this one is a cafeteria in a many food joints together
it has become one of my favorite places for dinner
definitely prettier than any other asian buffet ive been to
everything was fantastic
when youre all burgered out and for the unbearable interregnum between releases of the double down or the mcrib popeyes is a nice alternative
limited spots to sit but never had to wait
you cannot go wrong with the pork bone soup at this place
the people beside were raving about the steak and shrimp po boy sandwiches
thank me later
more like a luke warm chili with a big glob of guacamole on top
this is probably considered a classy or fine dining restaurant but it comes with a very casual comfortable feel that is not pretentious at all
we were indecisive about our wines so the server allowed us to taste two different wines so we could make our decision
great food prices and service
the cake was rich moist and decadent the warm toffee syrup was from heaven and the brown butter ice cream topped off everything wonderfully
one of my rolls wasnt sealed and fell apart every time i picked up a piece
ok so its not the end all of pizza
how is it that someone who orders the same thing as me 10 minutes later gets their stuff before i do
the squid was nicely done sticky rice bland and sauces doled out in small cups as though it was gold
i havent had anything better in vegasever
not only can you experience street eats from vietnam to canada to italyyou experience the chaos that is the south side itself baby
a beautiful restaurant with a great view
i am a big guy but this was substantial enough that i did not get the sandwich i had planned on ordering  will have to revisit for that
i would give it zero stars but that wasnt possible
it was ok went for lunch with a group of people from work and i knew it would mostly be for the ambience
halfway through my salad i found a hair in my salad not mine
this had great foie gras flavor and was warm and airy in texture
we ordered mac n cheese asparagus and drinks
food all the breaded meats are done perfectly  with the right amount of crunch but not a thick layer so it takes over the meat itself
the entire meal was 3000 per person that included starter main dessert and a free drink
yup thats where i was foxcroft answered my needs
there is bike parking nearby and a dog friendly patio stocked with water bowls for your pooch
service was exceptional and our party had a blast
however i do not like the first come first serve policy you should be able to make a reservation to avoid the wait
this is a really neat hidden gem
me and hubby were starving after bowling and decided to call in a pizza to pick up
we chose the latter which runs counter to the palate of the majority of toqus more sophisticated clientele
what kind of song does he know
it was played with the worst looking piece of scalloped potatoes ever made
i cant wait to get back to phoenix to go back
she probably should have some other tasks to do to draw in business or maintain the restaurant
a little busy from the tourist crowd but a good diner built for speed and quality
we went on a sunday night for the first time
all were very well executed
the service is good and usually quick unless they are busy
the menu states that grp uses whole milk wisconsin mozzarella hand shredded each day for freshness one taste and i believe it
and i did give our server a healthy tip
my mahimahi caesar salad was amazing
i was visiting cleveland from the east coast which has lots of indian restaurants
i ordered the cheese fondue grilled sandwich and asked for a salad substitute as the soup it came with is made with chicken
had special lunch for only 8
please dont order their ahi tuna skewers
our server made sure we were taken care of and kept our glasses full
this is a local spot that i go to for lunch at work
got order 90 min later bc they only had 1 driver and had no clue when she was going to be back
what really blows me away at fnb are the vegetable dishes
quality blend of flavorful greens no iceberg including arugula cherry tomatoes fresh mozzarella basil and a tasty balsamic glaze
i didnt see anything on the menu over 7
my first 5 star review
i remember basil  green peppers  red onions  artichoke  two types of olives
on y mange bien et on y boit bien
we stood and waited about 23 mins till i had to say hello
update went in after a year or soi lost about 100 lbs owner guy askes me if that fat fuk with the same name still works over there
id buy it to take home
we also ordered the garlic knots which were beyond awesome
i got the pan fried white fish with rice and lemon caper beurre blanc
the atmosphere was really great the service was friendly and the food was delicious
ive eaten breakfast and lunch and the food was good too
unlimited toppings on their pizzas mean you can make some pretty crazy creations you can but be careful ive made many that were almost inedible lol
the bad part was the tables we so close for the parties of two i had to move the table to one side to get out with out knocking someone ones drink off the table or in aiding their space
coming from southern cali this is as close as it gets
if on the strip could be at least 35x of the price
this is the worse of all
im not a huge fan of indian food but this place was good and each dish had a unique taste unlike other venues that serve indian food
the fries are huge and it might be the perfect fry for me
my friend and i order the prime rib special for  2495  it was very tough and fatty
the third time however i waited patiently for the fresh batch of crab legs and was handsomely rewarded
this is my favourite thai restaurant in toronto
the mint tasted like toothpaste not greatand weird but the vanilla is amazing
i can only comment on their vanilla latte and their teas because those are the only drinks i like to have
4350 chilean sea bass according to the menu is sauted and braised in a light southweststyle broth wilted greens crisp potatoes chilecilantro oil
chips and salsa is like pace or something generic crappy
you can tell the place is new when you step into the restaurant
they have quite a congestion problem in the drivethrough at lunch
my husband ran into him at a gas station
park in the back theres ample parking there
hoisin sauce too strong the bread not good
the meal was excellent
okay so my point is high quality fish if they charge as much as they do can be ordered by anyone and any restaurants  only few vendors anyways but kabuto lacks in details japanese edomae sushi should have small details that perfects a sushi bar and kabuto isnt there yet desert anintofu almond tofu was pretty amazing you should get that if you go there and waitress was sweet attention to detailed and amazing deserving of high tip  it was good experience and i do recommend people who have never been to japan or place like this try it you will enjoy it  just didnt meet my expectation if anyone ever goto osaka goto sanosa in shinsaibashi that to me is real  quality and detail meet together
good food but overpriced  the wait is long during peak hours but that is to be expected for most buffets in vegas
the tri tip was good
enjoyed two cocktails one with some ginger syrup great
we honestly just stopped for drinks and figured this was a safe betplace looked cool and there were empty spots in front perfect for people watching
im sure you got a great laugh
i guess it is a custom for customers to wait for food
all of the baked goods preserves granola lunches and loaves here are amazing as is the coffee
the crab rangoon are made from a thin crispy shell and they are absolutely  melt in your mouth delicious
well be back
it was the best iranian restaurant that i have ever seen in canadain this restauranteverything was  good but the price of wine was so expensive
they really train their wait staff well so does sassi here in scottsdale and that impacted the meal so positively
probably not but its pretty tasty and this is a comfortable hang with 3 pbr on tap
my wife was a big cornish pasty food fan prior to us finding this place and i have to say that she made me a believer when she brought me here
they do have a variety
i would highly recommend this restaurant for the food the service and the spectacular views
id come back
sat at the bar  had a light dinner okay two glasses of wine  a salad really
i felt the pricing was more than reasonable for a restaurant such as this
gibbys has such a great steakhouse feel the ambiance is perfect and their food is out of this world even the bread and butter was amazing
very strange and unacceptable way to treat customers
i love this place my family goes here a lot probably for like 13 years and the food is still delicious
we went twice in one weekend first for a late night snack and again the next day for happy hour because i am in love with their charred tomato salsa sooo good
this is only a problem because i was sort of hoping i could begin to figure out which kind of sushi i like most for those times that i might find myself at a place that isnt as good as sushi koma
i ordered pepperoni and green peppers on my pizza
between the three of us visitors all we could manage was some kind of grunt grughhh
i discovered that i really love indian food about two years ago
i was very disappointed
hence it does everything without a lack of focus
however as we got in our car the time on the dashboard said eleven which means we were there before eleven pm
the mgm does not have many choices when it comes to italian cuisine but truly have a gem in fiamma
the food is decent at best but im not really a fan of their pizza
as for the food one word salty
reminded of nyc steakhouses
their portions are big
its family owned and they love to chat
another day goes by and their next response was thank you for that
just the right amount of sauce
there are always pretty girls running around before the club at dinner and with the second floor location a really fun place for an outdoor dinner if you choose
they have an outdoor patio that looked nice
the atmosphere is casual and perfect for enjoying a tribe browns or cavs game in the bar
can i put that in here
ive had one savory one in sandwich form and it was a bit on the soggy side underneath
loved the dinner and loved the bill even morewith drinks about 100
u couldnt pay me to have a 450 lemonade again
we also ordered a pitcher of the mojito as well which was great
we ordered a ginger ale at the beginning and and did not get it until my entree came cause i had to ask again i mean considering there was a server and a trainee youu would think someone would have caught it
the chicago deep dish tasted great
in fact i was at one a few years ago in overland park ks
televisions everywhere enough to keep you hanging out for awhile to watch your favorite game
while all that added up pretty quickly the truffle fries were seasoned to perfection evenly but not too heavy handedly and definitely some of the best i have had in a long long time
waited in drive thru for 10 minutes and repeated my order 3 times
kudos to chef omar who was pleasant and humble
a little tucked away but so cute and fits well into the paris theme
great beverage selection i hate when i go to a bar and every type of liquor or flavor they dont have it
i ordered a small tropic thunder and small dr pepperoni with sesame crust
its fresh and always delicious
the staff was very friendl
okay to hang out for locals but not the place to impress
because i cant give a half star rating the living room in awhatukee will benefit from me rounding up as this is honestly a solid 25star place
ob das rinderfilet die penne mit lachs oder einfach nur eine pizza
i gave it an ok she also found the trotters and octopus good
the atmosphere was very modern and cool very similar to chipotle but much better
yes the king crab legs and shrimp were delish but besides that there was nothing that caught my eye or tummy
otherwise would not return for the food
it was freshly made and they brought it right to our table
my first brunch in montreal gave torontos brunch a serious run for its money
ive been to two of their other locations and its consistently good with great service at each one
conclusion food is unique and delicious despite being cooked inconsistently and service is slow
the servings were small the better to sample the three different kinds of pasta and the service was quick if you wanted more
i really dont know what the buzz is about
the hubs and i were on a mission to try it all andwe did
granted we were part of a fairly good sized party the service was excellent
they said it was raining so nobody else could play
but for real i am a fan of this tony romas because the crew gave me exceptional service from beginning to end
there was a politeness but just seemed very rushed
i think i would like their banana cream or even coconut cream pie better
food is tasty
3 crab applecrab sriracha apple and tempura fried
my experiencei enjoyed the casual atmosphere the service was speedy and the food was great for no more than 8
whatever you do do not ask her a question about the ingredients in a salad because she will flip out on you
everything was tasty but i especially loved the deviled eggs which they make with their pickle relish
what the hell are they filling the tacos up with crap for
it was as if he looked down on us probably because were younger
i ate every bite and i couldve licked the plate clean if i were allowed
i was a little worried when i saw the menu that it wouldnt be very flavorful
this manager on the other hand was totally rude and unapologetic
i was looking over at the customers next to us who ordered from the regular menu and noticed the server showed more attention to them and constantly refill their water whereas ours had been empty for a while and the server just simply ignored us
cooked just right and full of flavor
we brought the entire family to giuseppes last night for a prethanksgiving meal yes thats right  my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today
ive been to many breakfast places and besides being so convenient two blocks from my office and across the subway exit this traditional breakfast restaurant has good and diverse options both in size and ingredients
the portion sizes were certainly enormous but everything seemed greasy and that includes the plates and fistful of chopsticks they dropped on our table with all the care of a logging crane
fresh seafood yummy sushi bomb service
just enough time to start sampling the beers here but note that the bar is separate from the restaurant so you pay and close out in the bar before going to the restaurant
food was excellent
the fish was average
when i did so yesterday i did not receive the potatoes the menu stated were included with the combos
einzig eine neubesetzung im servicepersonal sollte man mike shark dem neuen betreiber ans herz legen
good and fast
everything was mediocre
a lot of salsa  cha cha music
we also shared a salad which was good but lacked a nut crunch
overall a great dining experience
it can easily be pushed aside
if youre going to four peaks for beer id say 45 stars but if youre going for dinner as i was i cant rate it higher than a 3  the beer is quite good
the service isnt as impeccable as it once was with our server being distracted and not on pointe
my husband loves teryaki but the service here sucksthe crab rangoon was dry hard and burnt the worst everthe guy behind the counter gave me my own plastic bag to bag up the containers in really
good is really good
staff is always courteous though sometimes a little overwhelmed by the lunch crowd  especially on fridays
it is a somewhat limited menu but had enough to suit us
you can stroll in here with a sportscoat or dress more casually if you like maybe leave the jorts behind though
it is elegant and upscale without being stuffy and pretentious
not only does mandys serve all of these allergenfree goodies but their regular wheat egg dairy etc pizzas are incredible too so my family says
although i said i would never go back my wife loves the duck wings here so we decided to give it another go
if anyone decides to go for some fast food here be sure to eat inside otherwise you will sit around out front waiting for just a few moments but really 15 plus minutes for your fresh food
so that was pretty accommodating
really wanted some mashed potatoes w some gravy but their special gravy is basically just like a runny au jus
that was not necessary
i had the raspberry white chocolate brownie around the holidays i still dream of it
back open for a week after renovations
yes we want the chicken broth
thats ok its your occasion and youre here to indulge
granite gaming has sold la bayou and mermaids and glitter gulch to derek stevens and his brother to add to their current portfolio of properties  the d the golden gate and the currently shuttered las vegas club
spicy shrimp  eggplant  dont really like eggplant very much but oh man that sauce is good
it tasted more pleasant than i expected
finally tried the place on wed while waiting for my car to be serviced
the biscuit was pasty for some reason as well
or rather it was
this place is incredible
ill definitely be back to pick up more fresh fish next time im in the area
the food wasnt even that great to make up for the awful service the tip was undeserved
and not the fatty kind you get in korean places
i heard so many good things about this place and with the service alonei wouldnt come back
fresh warm bread with real chilled butter and a decent cabernet to start
everyone was great
i assume they were the owners or something right
well never mind on dessert the staff just argued with each other about a table definitely uncalled for in front of us
we ordered the wnccprkw
the portion size was just right and we can even mix n match the splints in one portion
the waitstaff is attentive
im just writing this so victoria can go to disneyland
location is very nice  cozy
however i would recommend the other sandwiches they offer like the breaded chicken sandwiches
had dinner here on a friday night in vegas
i ordered 15 boneless wings with mild classic wing sauce
if you are planning to share a steak and a bowl order bowl first
we split the mediterranean mix appetizer which was feta cheese a selection of olives and a basket of warm soft and tasty bread
i had this place bookmarked because i saw that they had sushi pizza and oh boy do i love sushi pizza
the price is high considering the portion
coconut milk tea smells like a coconut macaroon and well i just like earl grey
the lasagna tasted like chef boyardee out of a can
go and enjoy
medium marinated 10 oz
everything is fresh fresh fresh its immaculately clean
its a nice change from a chain restaurant
maybe if youre less cynical youll enjoy your burger more than i did
plus each dish was served on a unique plate to add to the presentation
omlettes made to order and the service is great
this place is great for the whole family
the biscuits they started us with was huge
sure enough my dinner comes out with a large dollop of avocado
the food is a little too pricey for my liking but if youre looking for something special its worth it
i barely remember what we got due to starvation messing with my brain that night
were all still sitting there
its not a regular type of restaurant that we would usually go to since its super fancy
pizza is always hot fresh and delicious
my family was hungry and we left stuffed and content
i had their special of the day which was croque monsieur which i was excited to order but was majorly let down
the meat was excellent
i havent ordered anything that i didnt like from this place
however they batter them theyre crispy and juicy and taste so fresh
if you are looking for a great date spot
my husband likes panda express and weve been to this one a few times
if i had to complain about anything would be the noise level
ive tried curry which they ask between 15 and we had a 5 which my friend asked for a thai 5 not a white guys 5 since hes had some places skimp thinking he cant handle it and it wasnt that spicy at all
shaking his had because service  is so slow
for those that are on a mission to find quality authentic food and couldnt care less about glitz and glamour this is your place
the restaurant is very small and doesnt easily accommodate larger groups
besides of okra i also tried another new thing teh tarik which is known as pulled tea
i wont be back until yuva lowers their prices or introduces a lunch buffet
we have yet to find anything not worth recommending at this place  oh and you must try the desserts
we ordered a salad to start i got the blue burger and shared some truffle fries
bacon was juicy and crispy and not dried out
at the pita jungles id been to in the past the service was kinda bad inattentive unfriendly etc
though with a lot of other stuff around
service for us was pretty good
and all the people saying this is the best pho around it is not the best pho aroundin my opinion is pholicous on cactus and 75th ave
its a takeaway sandwich bar with really fresh and tasty sandwiches
not as overpriced as other sushi restaurants on the lv strip sekushi does a pretty good job
two sips in i was determined to not get another drink there so i nursed that one for the next couple hours
just for a well run service they deserve returning business so ill definitely be back
waited 10 minutes
you got the dim lighting with frank sinatraesque soundtrack lightly playing throughout the night
both were underwhelming
they charged us 369 and took off 74 so we ended up paying 295 for that item more than the listed price
all in all im glad to have yen in my sushi rotation but i wont be crowding the sushi bar regularly
browsing yelp for what is open in mid afternoon i found noras and decided to try  thanks to yelp ive found a great new choice
they actually stop you from leaving the restaurant if you dont give enough tip
theyre really good
theyve got a great selection of premade items including all of the little side dishes you would get at a korean restaurant
for those who are complaining about the dance floor being too small  uh which clubs are you comparing it to
guess i should have tried something else
beer and wine included which was nice
i am big fan of this restaurant
cant wait to come back for more
maybe i should have ordered the fajitas as they light them on fire tableside would have been warm  least
it was interesting eating with our hands rather than with cutlery
they are good and the quality remains high even opened for a long time
the stetson chopped salad is a famous dish as is the mushroom and polenta
the option is a must on everything i get even if its not included
had the pretzel bites and buffalo chicken dip as an app which was great then i had the philly cheese steak sandwich to top it off
same owners so youd expect the food to be equally fresh tasty and worth going to
i was charged 250 for small dribble of onions 250 and for refried beans which i ate in four bites
the truffle sauce was the best
the southwestern wings and red sangria big azz margarita are my favorites
you simply have to try their homemade pasta
i dont know what she was thinking but someone clearly doesnt belong in the hospitality industry
the acai bowl was 8 and it was large with blended acai sliced bananas strawberries and granola
i ordered the steak sandwich as i had been craving a steak all week
get a baguette with pimento and jam
the area in which canaletto is located has high ceilings painted like a sky with clouds the common area looked like a street with italian canal and the restaurant as if on a street in italy
all in all this place is pretty darn tasty
there was the perfect amount of sauce that was also very good
from the ingredients the the entertainment of watching it being made
my caesar came with a skewer of pearl onion green olive and a shrimp
decided to go with the adovada burro pork burrito combo wrice and beans and a negro modelo to quench the flames
reason being is that the sandwich must be pressed in a panini press forcing out a hot sandwich
however even when we had it on red the food just kept on coming
all in all i was very happy and will eat there again if i have the opportunity
gnocchi is one of my favorite dishes and theirs is by far one of the best ive ever had
alberto sat down with us for a bit and hes a cool dude that knows what he is doing looking forward to go again
beautiful patio and friendly service
we got the fire roasted tomato salsa which was good but lacked any heat
ordered prime rib medium rare came out well done
this is basically a vietnamese restaurant specializing in pho noodle dishes
just be aware for future
id also like to point out that after checking out leas other reviews she clearly cannot be pleased
orders are placed at the counter and then delivered to the table by a friendly sever
happy hour 2 oysters
it was saturday night 630 and the place was empty should have been the first clue the one man seats us brings our drink order and takes our dinner order mongolian beef for my companion and cashew shrinp for me soup egg roll  crab rangoon ok but meal comesshrimp with nutshe said as he set it downpeanuts are not cashews
the beef was a touch too salty to be as enjoyable as it could have been
recently they started offering serrano chocolate cupcakes which are also excellent
based on their other reviews it looks like sushi samba doesnt let anyone down
next the chicken and then the cheesy potato fillers
i love that the kitchen is completely open you can even see into the refrigerator
they were good especially the coleslaw
the young kids behind the counter were nice and took the order and had it prepared and delivered it to my table after a nominal wait
this is not a place to pass up
our waitress was friendly helpful and knowledgeable about which items were gluten free and which werent what more could anyone ask for
it just isnt appetizing
now im one of those folks who believes breakfast should be served three times a day so my breakfast in the afternoon hit the spot
i would of liked to try the pulled pork taco but it was sold out
ill be back
consistently the best place with interesting and tasty food and a beer list constantly changing
you could easily tell the difference between the managers and the servers
we attend events here frequently and usually  always  have a great experience
although the food was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable the food was somewhat overpriced
front desk is surly and unfriendly thanks selena you b for putting us in this room when we expressly asked for a quiet room
bailey jameson joel and i were lucky to chat with him
this is by far the best most authentic new york style pizza in the charlottehuntersville area
ive gone a few times but not recently but considering mexican food option in vegas this place is worth a try
my boyfriend ordered the german style reuben and our friend ordered the steak sandwich
their pasta is amazing as well last time i ordered egplant parmesan and was very tasty
i havent frequented this place recently because i cant expect great food  its just ok ok if you are craving chinese food and you are nearby
is it wishful thinking to think i got a fresh plate of bean sprouts
the homemade molasses is what dreams are made of
the place is really a fast food franchise dump like wendys jack in the box or carls jr with the whole look and feel
they also have really unique drinks and they do offer beer and wine
pretty chill spot
i asked for a beer yet it was warm as though the cooler stock is not rotated
kinda surprised they dont have better reviews here on yelp
i thought i was going to have a normal asian lunch
not a good start
being from san diego many bars and pubs charge around that price so i was actually surprised these burgers werent more expensive especially because it is vegas
never very noisy so ideal for a conversation or meeting
oh save room for the baklava made in house and turkish coffee
wish they stayed open later
today i went in there and order their mexican chilaquiles
the waiter brought out complimentary bread and green olives
my wife and i were able to share a meat order of 14 ribs and pulled pork
waited a little longer but i saw orders waiting in the window
very disappointed to have waited 30 mins for the order
i usually am a light saucer and just like to enjoy the meat
get your receipt from your meal and show it to the cocktail waitress upstairs in the lounge
the coffee was sub par the hot chocolate was just steamed milk with miniscule cocoa powder
we decided to give this place a try and im glad we did
we waited an extremely long time for our food and drinks and my husbands burger and fries were cold
boyf is type a and always books things in advance and he was getting sassy he booked way in advance as well
the second thing we ordered was their waffles with a side of scrambled eggs and link sausages
make reservations if you are to come
the duck was super dry and cold tell it had been retried in a pan
i am a big fan
if not there are smoothies and teas
ice cold beers and a smoke
the crust really had potential but it needed to be a bit crisper
then said oh its chicken
the three of us have been meeting at pita jungle for years
the broth is nice
it was massive and i couldnt finish the salad but for 1150 it just fell flat
our orders as follows 24 wings 1899 onion rings 499 cheese curds 699 quesadilla 599 fish tacos 799 and crispy chicken bacon sandwich 699 with sweet potato fries
at that point i got the hint
my hotel was right next to pieros so i walked over and sat at the bar for service
staff is friendly decor is interesting
its really the mise en place that everyone hates afterall right
me and my friends decided never going to this place again
in short i for spiritual reasons i was fasting from all meat and television for two months
i also appreciated that he asked if any of us had any food allergies before prepping the surprise desserts
definitely a good spot to hit up after the clubs though using the bread to soak up all the alcohol and hopefully you wont puke it all out after
the best in town
i sat at the bar a i did have a server i had four
i figured they were having a problem the first time i was there because their power kept going out
the food and beverage is excellent
my friend had his family in from australia and matthew was quick to explain different parts of the menu to them along with making sure that they enjoyed what they had ordered
our waitress  lexi was fantastic very pleasant and informative
but no you had to go and ruin everything we had and share your curry concoctions with complete strangers
the only draw back the two hosts were younger and disinterested
and the fattiness coats your lips mouth and throat in a really unappealing way
this place was recommended to me be a local family member and it by far exceeded my expectectations
they  are really good
cooked to perfection  it just melted in my mouth
i like that this serious foodie place is open till 3 am and i can see how chefs and other folks would come here after they close up their kitchens
easily enough for 23 people
desert  i never get desert
my friend ordered the croquemonsieur nicoise
its kind of funny
weve already been back twice
we got 1 burger  1 beer and it was almost 3800  so im not happy
my dining companions enjoyed the spicy seafood ramen but i hated it i thought the noodles were undercooked and the the accompanying soup tasted like instant ramen
the glasses were dirty and the bartender was beyond awkward almost like she was tweaking and it smelled like a bathroom in a dirty gas station
i was expecting veggies on top of penne pasta with marinara sauce like the menu said
the beef tacos were solid
i am extremely disappointed in mad greens for putting me in this extremely uncomfortable position because i was starving and i had this gorgeous salad that i couldnt eat directly in front of me
wont be coming back very often anymore
highly recommend this dish
waited a few minutes for my turn at the hostess stand
the funny thing is she did not know what falafel is and asked me what the delicious green stuff was
service was excellent
there were so many tasty sounding options on the menu
sidenote there are games tucked away in a corner where the magazines were
but hey it was worth it
excellent cocktails every timefrom different time periods
downstairs they have a shitton of large screen tvs its a decent place to go just for strictly sports bar type of activities like watching a suns playoff game
lots of stalls and very clean
the chicken was close to being burnt and had a crunch to it with a not so good taste
especially for the price
we ordered the fried pork dumpling and sticky rice which were nice and piping hot
he said the bun was very good
i tried to complain and i was sneered at
they brought us free soup to start
the lady i spoke to on the phone said that it has to be an mgm owned restaurant and that it does not count
huge portions very good food
they increase prices a lot here
joel robuchon is the highest ranked chef in the world with 30 michelin stars and counting
i usually go to the location on 7th ave but was in a hurry on my way home from work and stopped at this location last week
it makes me feel so happy to just sit and read while eating their delicious alohavocado
wir waren im sausalitos mit einer grossen gruppe
because of the location i imagine it was a large group in town for a conference but they took up the whole space and it had to be near 100 people
plenty of options on the menu for all food lovers
they apologized and said they took our appetizer erwaitedwaitedwaitedsee a common theme here
plenty of food for two and very filling
if you are looking for a unique dining experience with great service and well prepared food in a casual environment this is your place
i had the sampler platter the east coast platter and had the shark bite  pineapple pia colada
its located next to the ipic so you can grab dinner before heading in to see a movie
my friends and i go here weekly
food and service was the best
i felt i am at right place for japanese food
service was attentive also a good thing considering how slow it was sometimes servers slack off when its slow
i got the char siu tonkatsu ramen instead of the pork belly one because i didnt want it heavy on the meat
overall this is any ok place to eat but it can get pretty expensive
all the staff was friendly i like that about palette
new restaurant hellojitoronto on stclair ave w serves this delicious cheesey baked pasta
favorite restaurant for an outstanding filet
aufgrund der guten lage sind waren wir im el chico spontan essen
pretty groovy place
i really liked the hotel and everything was really nice but i dont think id stay here again
cheer up ladiesyou work in a crazy place
plentiful portions and great queso
i called the restaurant back and they refused to give me a refund and only offered free buffet for two even when i made it clear i wouldnt dream of eating there again
they are not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for in terms of quality preparation and overall freshness
i was surprised to find that they have quite an extensive menu considering the size of the place and decided on my goto of chirashi assorted sashimi on rice 16
service was surprisingly prompt given the other reviews
this place is super wierd hostess is arrogant food is o erpriced and we had to wait fosuper long time to get it and my looks like my mojito did not have any alcohol
if im ever in charlotte again though ill definitely have to bring some friends to this place the atmosphere is simply lovely
either get a combination plate thats like 80 noodles or enjoy the worthwhile entrees a la carte with relatively pricey sides
finally we hogged her booth almost all evening and not for a moment did i get the impression she was trying to rush us or get rid of us
we were extremely disappointed in the food and service
thanks again ladies you rock
it was so fun to watch the chef make our food over the bar top where we were sitting
well in this case my first impression was correct
und zur vorspeise einen kleinen gemischten salat
owners are very nice and always come by to talk
fez is awesome for happy hour as others have mentioned i never really bother with the food maybe i ought to
its the perfect combination of sweet salty and crunch
a couple months back while driving through the drive thru our car drove over a ditch in the middle of the drive through and damaged the rim
you could buy a vip pass and skip the line for brunch which includes one drink also
first course was a choice of a salad or castilian soup
please look at my other reviews
during this stay we had a meeting the lasted way too long and the staff did not mind that we loitered
owner was serving food and he was nice but i dont think i would come back again
came in for lunch thinking this would be a good place to have some tacos  i chose 3 meats asada tripas and alpastor
lots of air inside this calzone
it reminds me of the east coast pastry shops with all of the pastries behind the glass
and just as good
great theater and the best fajita i have eaten either side of the pond
first of all you have to pay for the chips and salsa really
i did notice that most of the people there appeared to be work colleagues not families or couples
i gotta say the west coast must make food better or something
how do i give 12 a star
what more could you really ask for from a sandwich joint
all of these dishes are on the heavier side but were absolutely delicious
they never took drink orders then took 45 min to bring out a diet coke
i ordered the tortiglioni and it was pretty good with mushrooms and bacon yummmmmmmm
before going to the cashier to pay my due i was intrigued by what looked like to be potatoes with some sort of dressing
my favorite is their goat cheese pizza but thats what i always get so it was time to try something different
i liked the fact they had different types of fries i had the waffle ones
plenty of tvs to watch sporting events on tv
bottom line go for the food
we watched our fries and onion rings sit under the lights for 10 minutesarrived cold and over salted
after all of that wonderful food the rest of the day was kind of a blur love love love arcadia farms and cant wait to go back
for 1995 all you can eat  i though it wouldnt be too bad
cole slaw was boring
food was good so check it out if you can find a parking spot
if for some reason i find myself back at pita pit id definitely go the veggie route
ordered the yellow curry and thai bbq chicken
i feel guilty leaving without having a dollar to throw downbut i dont carry cash and theres no option to write in a tip on the receipt so
i then realized the philly cheesesteak only had steak and cheese
as for the sandwiches itself it was just as good as the first one i had
girls for the love of god bring rollyshoes with you no matter how comfortable your 6 stilettos are
its not very big and all the tables are reserved with bottle service
the table in front of us had asked for a lemonade 5x in total and didnt even get that
the steakhouse formerly known as mad onion has a wonderful and comfortable decor and open all night long
i had the double pancake pork burgers topped with lettuce cheese and tomato with pad thai fries 15
and for what you paid for i had a slight feeling that i lost more money than what i spent at the hofbrauhaus
i had the leak soup which was good and the spinach strawberry salad with grilled salmon which was very good
our waiter found us a perfect cozy booth and gave us the cafe menu even though we were sitting in the restaurant area
the food is a wonderful change from typical cuisine
the urban outfitterslike decor lowlevel lighting and barlike atmosphere from feast and fiji sushi still remained
the steak was very flavorful but tough and chewy
the food here was absolutely delicious
we tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out
the new owners who say they are the original owners stated they didnt change any of the original recipes
it came with rice and black beans
the sides were generous and delicious lobster bisque gargonzola mac  cheese king crab gnocchi
my suggestion is to come here for their oxtail soup and their cal prime rib special
lots of flatbreads charcuterie and small bites appetizers make for varied options when ordering
alex   steven got right to work and in no time freaky fast
obviously i will try another dish to see if it is cooked any better than my favorite
i did not like this place at all from the moment we sat down i was uncomfortable
fridays is always a good place to get a meal but ive noticed their prices go up
the entire staff at the sb are great and i found another place to give a great fast
made the trek from glendale to tempe to try this place with friends after seeing the booth at phoenix comic con
one of the best restaurants in phoenix sky harbor airport
the ingredients seem to be fresh but we have never had anything that was amazing or made us say wow
also some of the employees werent very friendly
if this restaurants review was soley based on the staff it would be 5 stars all around
it has got comfy seating and eating areas
but the corn cakes are superb and i just want to make a meal of them with some of that lamb they slow cook
the hot dogs just werent that good
i thanked her in front of him and said this is what i was expecting
for being as busy as they were they were well staffed attentive and fast
further more no one ever returned to the phone after 5 minutes
the crepe is a thin delicious pancake drizzled with hot chocolate and topped with raspberries blackberries and blueberries
this place will definitely be a treat meal staple in my household  especially once the delivery service starts up
we went on a monday evening so there wasnt a lot of people but they do have buck a shuck oysters from 47pm that day so it was a huge plus for us
the ambiance is so nice and chic
although its a bit ironic because who wants to eat more of something they dont enjoy this would be a 1 star review but it is 2 because of the good service that was provided by the single man running the entire place
there was also a live band playing which made for a really nice sunday brunch and we had a great time here
it was an amazing experience and i highly recommend buddys for your next special occasion
it was probably one of the best tasting foods i have ever had
i dont care about those who park here and go to the dorms and what not even for a short period of time
great addition to the neighbourhood
the chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it
this place is mediocre
the atmosphere is nice  dark and brooding with a hint of sexy
thats the only way i can describe this place
fried kimchi dumplings 1025 with hot chili oil were also a crowd pleaser
the staffs are all friendly and are willing to let you sample pretty much everything before you make your purchase upon request
i was so disappointed and on top of it the pizza was 2100 i felt ripped off
and a spicy peanut sauce
i always leave room for dessert
the food itself was tasty well portioned and very well presented
i had the chorizo autenticos which were very good as well as the street corn which was delicious
we were together with the family of 5 and they ordered chicken teppanyaki  only
the biscuit was a flaky moist peace of heaven
after more discussion about vegas cashier apologizes and perhaps starts to think customers receive veggie dogs and ask for relish and guldens mustard because they have seen them at every other hdoas
we wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal
first fridays has turned more into a freak show rather than an art walk call me oldfashioned but i actually like art on artwalks
anyway wicked spoon ill be back for you
so rather how would i describe the food
we made the best of it though and had a few jokes to keep ourselves entertained
flight i found this place on yelp
hopefully there will never be a wait during lunch as i see us returning often
i had some sushi for lunch the next day and it was great then went back to the beef short rib for dinner again with delicious green tea ice cream
no other place on campus has this problem
all in all it was a very clean place very friendly and colorful waitstaff and ill definitely try it again
i decided to get the shrimp pad thai and an order of cream cheese wontons
i love kultura because their food is just like how i like to cook at home
i just wish i wrote down the name of the winery
he absolutely loved it
i do like this place
for the appetizer we order the hot bollix which is a creation of their own that is a combination of irish bacon potatoes irish cheddar cheese and a few other things fried and served with hot sauce and ranch dressing
good taste though
bread was good sauce was great ordered a chicken avocado tomato sandwich called razzle dazzle with extra veggies the two things i need on a sandwich tomatoes and avocado were missing
ive told him ill buy if he flys
their buffet menu has now less options not much of choice in desserts and main course
we traded a half of each
dobra tea is a beautiful combination of extensive tea collection and ornate decor
i must start off by saying we eat here quite often
i get wanting to turn tables but if we wanted fast food we would have went to nothing but noodles and saved ourselves a bit of money
the slaw is what made it go over the top
i feel like i have to try it again just to see if its always like that or if it was just a bad batch
i am not sure if this restaurant is for everybody because if i were to take my grown kids there they would not appreciate the authentic mexican food because they have not been exposed to it the only food they know about is tacos burritos enchiladas tamales chiles rellenos nachos etc
it has diced garlic on it to add more flavor to the already flavorful meal
after waiting 45 minutes with a house full of hungry little kids play date  i called them to ask about the pizzas  and thats when i found out
the only reason i went is because my mom likes it
it was solid
if youre a tourist or not a las vegas local reading this review then i urge you to ignore everything i typed and go here youll have a great time
this was the standout dish for me
i also tried the lyonnaise potatoes and they taste very similar to the potatoes my grandma prepared for us as kids
in here i can get my favorite chinese food and hong kong style durian crepe
ok for you first time noobs the way i see it you only have one of three options
pretty good spot to hang out
the fries were super good though
in all honesty it didnt really bother me personally but you could definitely hear other tables conversationsand they could hear ours so much so that they wished me a happy birthday and doted on the fact that my boyfriend bought me a kindle and how much they loved theirs
we just visited in january and the fireplace was going
btw if you bring in a groupon they expect you to order 1 dish per person dinning
breakfast for 2 arrived  and that was just mine
this place is garbage
im not even sure if it was even rice because it tasted very mushy
ordered the gaucho steak
there were 5 of us on a thursday that arrived at 500 maybe 12 a dozen people there having drinks
and to boot the restaurant has an extensive beer menu
which is great because their appetizers are ahmazing
in my opinion he looked ridiculous in it and much more inappropriate but at least we got in and had a good laugh
appetizer green mary lou reminded me of a crispier thicker quesadilla
the stew did contain many small bone
im sure a lot of other people really like this place but it just wasnt for us
they are constantly short staffed and it seems the owner could give two shits about it
fabulous little place
these are seriously good chips too
walking into this place we were greeting by 2 staff members saying hi to us as everyone else after that who walked in the door
my preschooler loved the food and the staff didnt seem to mind that she dropped her fork a few times and we needed extra napkins those with kids know how meal time can be
i dont get why this place is so famous other than most people are lemmings
the cake was very eggy tasting more like an omelette in flavour than well cake
very good option for us west siders
we waited about 15  20 minutes before realizing that we were probably going to have to eat at the bar so we ordered our food which was a bit of a drawn out process
i got the barbacoa tacos and they were delicious
surf and turf gal and i swapped bits from our plates and while hers was good i just loved mine
ask for a seat by the window the bench is cuter and the two person table is cozy and bright
then i graduated to tacos el tizon where they melted cheese onto the tortilla as a taco base
if youre a nonsmoker then i think youll enjoy this place quite a bit
we love ethnic food but rarely eat mediterranean style cuisine
a little hard to find its downstairs under copacabana
coffee is good but could be better
if your friend was a fantastic chef and host
my three year old son who is very picky even loved the dish asking for more
ive got pretty much no complaints
service was attentive but pacing was off
i have an issue with food invented by peasants now reduced in size and increased in cost
five drinks  a total cost of 105 is ridiculous
the hummus was okay not bad but nothing special but the baba was really good
they have a very nice bar which when i hit it up is usually just me and possibly some poor sap who has joined me and a couple dozen engineers from the various software companies around the area
and the food is very mediocre
thomas the maitre d is beyond kind and makes the experience great
i think most people judge  it by its appearance as opposed to anything  else
i hope the owners are reading these reviews because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether
so many games
but not very keen on quiet in a sushi restaurant
the beef shank was not super tender but was still enjoyable esp when dipped in the raw garlic sauce that comes with it
brain masala and butter naaan
the sweet potatoes w marshmallow topping were definitely sent from heaven
also we sat in the booth and it was uncomfortable the bench was made for tall people and im not short at 57 so it was either sit up and away from resting my back or bring my legs up so my knees couldnt bend and feet couldnt rest on the ground
the food is dry in the evening as mostly its the leftovers from lunch hour
i dont get the hype this is not good sushi
vinsanto is the best italian restaurant i have visited in the vaughan area
that said i have a hard time accepting any business as a brewery that brews only from malt extract
my pint of beer which they had brewed themselves was only 450 and it was pretty good
today wasnt my first stop at wesleys deli but it may be my last
i ordered a cream puff that was nearly five dollars and have been throwing up all night due to food poisoning
went back in november and something changed
great tap selection
this past sunday we were in need of some delicious breakfast and decided to pop in regardless of how busy they seemed to be
first this is by no means a seafood restaurant
nice atmosphere decent food and great beer
coming from a worldwide foodie who is also comes from a 3rd generation german family of pig farmers this establishment offers some of the best bacon and bacon dishes i have found
plus tg has that cheap lunch special
i would  recommend this establishment
the chicken is breaded very lightly jonny described it as japanese chicken nuggets
place was dirty
max brenner knows chocolate
weve changed but durants will always be old phoenix
overall a good place to get ramen but there are better places in my opinion
for the main courses we got the uni pasta in creamy tomato sauce and beef hamburger
great service  jenna was our waitress she was awesome
big fan of this place
horrible food and service not so good
it is a small restaurant but nicely decorated and clean
and get this its good
i havent had many drinks with more sugar though
this deal also includes your choice of meat and an order of eggs
the pastaw as perfectly aldante and the sauce was so creamy while bursting with the earthy mushroom flavour will visit again
the hostess was very friendly and prior to getting seated i asked a waiter passing by if he had scissors
clearly in america were used to absurd dining experiences massive portions fasteating and so on
i fall into the category of the person who loves the food and cant stand the staff
at first the server was a little abrupt because of my active and loud toddler
if you want to get to barcelona without any travel time this is the place that will give you the vibe
we each ordered a combo  i ordered the chinese chicken salad with tomato soup and the hubs ordered a half sammy with the cream of mushroom soup
we were wrong
up was a newish restaurant in shadyside and we found the entire experience very enjoyable
i cant imagine what it would be like when they have a rush
both times ive eaten here have been because ive been there for a show  but even though i was one of the folks there for the show i find it really irritating that all the people coming in for the show have to go through the restaurant to get there  or stand and wait in line next to a table if its a big show
that said ill definitely be back probably during this trip
my favorite was the hawaii classic  ahi tuna was delish
the breast was over cooked and chewy
plus they allow you to bring your dog to the back patio
i decided to look for someone to serve us at the bar and still i got no service
takoyaki myself and another friend were able to stay later until 1130 only after most people had left were we slowly receiving our sushis
he was kind but you could tell he was new
so im standing at the counter to order and a girl names bailey took her time to walk up to us
the staff are so nice n very attentive
our server antonio was fantastic
i feel like a lot of people give this place a hard time
his hong kong wonton noodle soup had only 3 wonton
i used to come here when i was young because my dad knows the owner but i never came back until around 10 years later
overall great place to eat a sushi meal
i dont do bad customer service i dont care how amazing your productfood is
friday night but we were seated immediately the staff at the front door is warm and welcoming our waiter justin was excellent the manager mike came by our table to make sure everything was ok he was super nice too
save yourself the trouble of breaking the bank at one of the fancy steakhouses on the strip and head downtown o
the prime rib and steaks are  awesome
especially for the kids meals
no need to sell it
we were definitely not impressed and after figuring out that the patina group owns this one and the others in socal we were further disinterested and it made sense as to why we werent impressed
we came back today upon alan the food and beverage manager request to make it right
the rigatoni was tasteless with a bland marinara sauce
as they are mistreating their employee
my personal favorite are the pork and mushroom dumplings
i would say i wish they had nicer tvs but i did like the touch screen thing they had in the rooms where you can get information on the resort and local attractions
i asked him if he could turn it down so we could eat lunch he told me to go fuck myself
the concierge was super nice and recommended some good places to eat but doing a quick yelp search was a good backup
i believe i will be coming here a considerable amount in the near future
we decided to make a full date of the experience and also have dinner at the theatre
thats nice and all but the experience still suffered and he also had an attitude as if he was doing us a favor which frustrated me even more
i tried the caesar brussel sprouts which were tasty but if youre looking for seafood id venture on and check out more places
all three dishes were outstanding particularly the seabass
in fact the ordering experience and food prices left me thinking 3 stars so an average of 4 sounds about right
if you are like me and eat ghost peppers for snack ask for max hot
pros  food was great
my husband and i went to lazizas on 1232015 around 2 pm
pretty lame went here for breakfast since the only other choice inside the hotel was a long line at the starbucks
she started to get the sour cream all over the wrap the guac fell out and she did not put any more in i was loosing my protein also
en fait cest le seul caf tudiant rentable dans tout luqam
made it a little difficult to finish
i prefer a saucy parmesan flavor
ended up throwing up and did not recover until evening time
dinner with a view
i will say that their godfather dessert is pretty good
the unlce louie rustica is amazin  and so is the spinach artichoke dip
i def recommend it
besides being utterly disappointed with our steak
so if you wanted to eat any of the asian side of the menu the wait is 20min for your order
they are sisters sisters
weve actually been there twice
the staff is good
well let me tell you its glorious
even though the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seating at the bar we opted to get a regular table and let the bar be available for the couplessingles
china town has so many great restaurants in the area but this one is not going to be on my radar in the future unfortunately
on the outside i would not take a date here but on the inside i would
thirdly  chez chilis decor ranges from the sinological to the surreal
ive been going here for 15 years and it is always perfect
my gf especially appreciated the pickled peppercorns in the spice mix
there are a few tables inside with very basic fluorescent lighting and close proximity to the register
i am glad that chandler is starting to get some really good places to eat like bld
the last time i called in i placed my order and was told itd be 2530 min
thank god for bbq sauce tabasco and syrup or i wouldnt realize i was eating food
it is a smoking bar with a bad ventilation system
i really wish the young kid would stop greeting me by saying are you ready to order
although there was some good sashimi and tuna salad there were no good rolls
they squeeze fresh orange juice right at the baryum
cant say anything is excellent but average or above
took advantage of bar specials and lovely ambience
their wedge salad was great
i give this restaurant 45 only because their portions are small for the price plus they hate to give you salad and chatny according to the number of people who will be sharing it by the way it is same with all the desi restaurants apart from this lets talk about positive things
this is a very nice atmosphere and great on a pretty day to sit outside
my husband and i were very disappointed in the service we received here
skip chipoltle you wont be disappointed
we certainly dont need to be insulted by those at the grotto anymore
the curry had just the right amount of spice to it not burn your tongue off so you cant enjoy the food
i had a walleye sandwich which came broiled instead of deepfried as i requested i kept it anyway
the waitstaff was charming and attentive and very well informed about their food
the spicy spam musubi is amazing
he said up north were used to a sweeter sauce for the beans so maybe it was just me
the service was great though you may have to wait a little if you have a large party in which i did
its next to the sports book at the mgm grand
fabulous caesar salad and the sea bass was literally the best i have ever had
i gave it two stars because the service was good
then after a bit our appetizers came
most servers truthfully cant stand their regulars but shes actually genuine
all the salmons came under cooked and one frozen
avoid any words with the assistant manager she should never be aloud to talk to customers
great for families and kids as the bar area is tiny
ive had the crepe which is egg ham and cheese and it is absolutely delicious
i have been to this location about 45 times have to say such an amazing shop
my friend and i came here for dinner on a saturday using groupon
too bad i am from the states so i wont be returning as often as i want to
they know what theyre doing
i love this place
popped into what used to be blunt a couple of weeks ago for a cuppa and a bite to eat in the evening
another table ordered the surf  turf near by  his steak was undercooked too
very good food for the price
eating  eating  cut another piece to share with my friend and she stopped me and my chix was raw  i was so bummed
we had a good chuckle thinking about why a restaurant would have a small large and an extra large sizes instead of just simply having a small medium and large
this was our first  time in several yrs but we like great sushi on a budget
perfect portion size and had a unique and very flavorful taste
i was sitting outside enjoying my lunch catching up with one of my girlfriends when the waiter came and took away the patio umbrellas and rudely stated that they were closing early because they ran out of ingredients
the atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice its pretty large
ordered the 3kabob combo
this charming bistro offered everything tantalizing food outstanding service and the perfect environment to relax and enjoy
this place is horrible
after moving back from seattle in 2013 i really missed having access to great food from around the world until i found la kabob
i feel like part of the incrowd whenever i dine at barrio cafe
we asked them about it and they said on the house
eh sadly the last few times weve gone thereordered takeout from there its been less than awesome
this place alone is reason to visit montreal again
its much tastier
i have been waiting for a decent mexican restaurant to open in my neighborhood
want to eat like you just hit the jackpot
if we didnt have the clam problem i would have given three stars because it was just ok i dont want to go to anyplace that would serve someone a dead clam on top of their dinner i will not be back and am thinking i should have given one star
meat carving stations
but i am in if my friend says lets do it
at that point i had no harsh feelings towards that jimmy johns location
the mac  cheese had a little bacon which gave it a nice smokey flavor
they give you as much free delicious and warm bread as you want with balsamic
nonetheless a really great option when in the area for a late night snack
great authentic mexican food
i served tables for 4 years usually when things go that drastically wrong a manager comes to the table and sincerely apologizes maybe even adjusts the bill accordingly
weve had their pad see ew as well and that was really yummy
i now understand why this place is a popular lunch spot
he would make you pay for both
nice location nice decor  very modern and straight and amazing food  we had the indian dinner for 2  which was enough for the three of us
it is a little tucked away but worth the trip
our waiter greeted us quickly and he gave a nice overview of the menu options
now the reason why i am bringing this up is because the bb location is fairly removed from any major hub like the annex to the north little italy to the south and the harbord village near spadina and as such i can only imagine that outside locals traffic would be in general very slow
a friend of mine suggested biaggis along with a couple other restaurants as a place to go for dinner on a friday night
but there is someone there to help you if need be
had to ask several times and by the time i got it my food was cold
some recommendations i would give for first timers would be orange chicken twice cooked pork salt  pepper squid mongolian beef yin  yang fried rice black bean squid vegetable curryfeel free to add meat of your choice kung pao shrimp 5 enjoy delicious food 6 split the bill 7 laugh at the fact that you just had some of the best asian food ever for a mere 57 dollars
weve visited several times with similar experiences each time
795 for a build your own pizza unlimited toppings awesome deal
very tasty  2 chicken biscuits the biscuits and chicken were very tasty
this was a big hit with the staff for sure and really i got off pretty cheap considering that we fed a total 8 people for right around 20
excellent salsa  drinks were delicious but mostly ice
the buns are a bit fragile but its whats inside that counts and dam is it delicious
items were constantly being refilled with fresh replacements
no bias and no gimmicks
stuffed mushrooms were good but my least favorite out of the three
one of the best parts of the meal was the free margarita with the yelp check in
it does feel like youre going to a friends place for a good breakfast and a hang out
we were all very stressed though because we got there at 1pm and didnt get our food until 140pm so we basically had to scarf our food down in 10 minutes to give us 10 minutes to drive back to our office
we tried poutine about a month ago in toronto and it was nothing like this
while the dishes were generally wellprepared with good ingredients the menu was very limited and all the dishes were overpriced
it is always packed unless you dont mind the wait
first off the decor is much nicer and the art more tasteful and the food is just plain better
it was only a few bucks but its the principle of the thing
a good solution for both our tastes
located in downtown vegas right across from fremont street firefly offers up a clubbeylounge area for party goers that want to avoid the crowdedness of the strip
i would not go back if you paid me
he is the who wrote a book about his mother keeps talking to him from the grave
reading some yelpers and also having followed chef jose andres and his accomplishments we figured wed give this place a try
all in all a great place
nice work on turning things around
i was writing a review tonight for a terrible experience i had at jersey mikes down the street and decided to look for something that was close and had good reviews
the burger catergory is nuts
my friends drinks were a cut above mine
the sangria was delicious and the prices were good
nice atmosphere and friendly staff at this fire stationthemed sub shop
the bartenders seem to keep the folks at the bar entertained with their flare style of bartending tossing of flaming bottles
all of the walnut cakes looked the same and i really really didnt want to accidentally bite into the wrong one because i once had a horrifying red bean paste incident at asian legend
this was a very nice place servers are friendly and food is amazing
this is a great place to grab drinks with the girls and enjoy some shareable bites
i know you worship me
unique art lines the walls
great to have las up closer to our part of town
casual breakfast place with a good amount of options
i really enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the sausage inside though
the service was also very attentive and friendly and our food arrived quickly
for starters its very low quality food
i had the tempranillo which i liked but wasnt amazing
ill be back soon
im really torn about my rating for paladar
than guess what happened we sat and sat and sat and waited for our check
not a bad version at all
very rarely do i feel so passionately about a business that i review them mere hours after leaving
was there for brunch and loved it all 3 of my friends meals were perfect and we loved the atmosphere and decor very very good
yes you heard me right
the workers where so nice and helpful about what was their favorite
had multiple arguments with the cook who was also helping by walking out the orders and serving tables i took my food to go and it would have been fine but i asked for sides extra fries avocado and jalapeos on my burger etc  was charged for all of that but got none of it didnt even want to say anything or argue it with the waitress because she already seemed a hair away from snapping
apparently the service changed and this is where they lose me as a customer
it was classier than your regular sports pub and has a restaurant bar and lounge all spaced nicely into one neat package
for such a new restaurant the customer service was already in line
we were quoted a 45 minute wait by an asian woman who seemed less than pleased to see us
there was no issue at all redeeming it and the staff upon arrival was very courteous
give it a try today and let me know how you like it
i am sure the finest organic ingredients were used but the beans that accompanied my street tacos were probably the tastiest part of both meals
when i told them that it had to be chicken i felt as if the person was frustrated with me by not taking what they had given me
one would think being the palace of anything would generally infer that you have some sort of specialty usually having to do with you being the palace of that particular itemwell not here
i usually come to this location because its close to work but ive never had an issue with their chicken salads at any location
really the worst crepe weve ever had
all of the boys were in heaven with all of the selections
the sports book staff was really the only positive experience i had during this and previous visits and unfortunately is not enough reason to return to this hotel
some of the greens were wilty  soggy looking instead of vibrant green  when i get salads they really need to look and taste fresh  especially when panera is now all about clean fresh ingredients
das oggi wurde mir als guter italiener in der stuttgarter innenstadt empfohlen und ich kann mich nicht beschweren
yes it costs about 400person for the full tasting menu without wine
not worth the wait
the place is cute and it was busy and everyone else seemed to be enjoying their food so i plan on trying againbut definitely staying away from the aforementioned items
i cant believe this is like a step down from robuchons flagship next door
while the food was good it was not amazing
try the steak bites and the gouda plate they are divine
my motherinlaw wanted to leave but we just had them bring out new plates
by far of the best hand made burgers ive ever tasted
the french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck moremight be worth the upgrade
the insides were still cold
the restaurant is located in the front of the venetian so overlooks the strip making for a nice view at night
but here im excited to try more
we eat vietnamese often and this is definitely going to be our new place
they misplaced my card for two days
they do live music here and my band was scheduled to play recently
price wise its not too expensive
the food is amazing and very authentic flavorful beautiful
good bbq joint dry rubbed chicken is my favourite of all the meets
fries where a  step up from the norm and for a price of under 7 bucks it sure beats any fast food chain
i should have been offered a discount free drink or some incentive to come back
at just under 40 per person i expected at least a bourgeoisie feed lot
sounds all good right
this is the loss of the 2 stars as poor service can ruin an experience the food was pretty good though
wir bekamen gleich einen tisch zugewiesen und dann sassen wir da
we were sat outside and sitting outside isnt too bad because they have heaters by the tables
i ordered the kababe kubideh which was a ground beef and lamb kebab served with basmati rice  torshi makhloot mixed pickled vegetables lots of parsley and dilltomato and onion
the chef knows what heshe is doing
service was efficient and could be friendly depending on the server you get
food   not bad just pretty bland
okay so this was after all a huge misunderstanding
i tried it  since it was ayce but really didnt like it
we be back for more pizza soon
we were still waiting over 25 minutes later and no one came over to check on us
the girl with big boobs across my table did get extra exceptionally good service
in fact for the first half of my visit i did very much
definitely get the meatballs
there was also a beautiful black and white movie playing on the wall during service which was a lovely touch to the sophisticated vibe of the restaurant
its an acquired taste
on the other hand the krokiet croquette was kind of bland for a fried crepe filled with meat
as for the fries heres a money saving tip
ive gotten a bagel sandwich with egg at einsteins before and its not usually one of my favorites
i used to visit this place when it was still called myth
greek food is pretty good stuff too
my new go to place
we love jasons deli and there ice cream
we thought this dish was just ok  nothing exciting
complementary refills were frequent and timely
because everyone is so rude we all stop buying from this subway i will be calling corporate office to complain about the staff
zur erklrung beide lokale stehen unter derselben fhrung
it was slightly salty i had the salmon with the goat cheese and spinach crust
i dont know i read what people say i understand they come here for 5 years but i dont get why
you will be back every time you visit vegas
there are not many places to eat compared to other airports
the butter chicken was excellent
if you dont speak spanish dont worry they are very nice and understanding when you order
so the beef schwarma is 599 and the total bill came out to be 779 which meant they charged me 180 for tax
i am disappointed though because these past two times their quinoa was not fully made so it did cause me some troubles that day later on
there were three of us and we all ordered different things and they were all delicious
well what can i say
the waitress was nice enough but just seemed extremely confused in general
i thought the pork belly would be crispy but it was fatty and still yummy
totally try this place out
the algarve shrimp tails caught me off guard
we usually order food for 35 people and its always very good
great food and service
maybe we got a grumpy chef
we typically order the panang beef chicken in a farm pad see ew and house thai salad
bangers n mash on point
sorry some people are new to this place and dont know the menu
the falafel was delicious and i loved the crunch of cucumbers and kale slaw
i will definitely be coming in more often
i waited way too long for my food
was 795 plus 3 for juice
great place for a late dinner
dont be discouraged by the lines as they move quickly
i also ordered a regular side of macncheese and a drink
i had the man salad and she had the kale something or other
stopped in at apache and got a enchilada plate red cheese actually white cheese that was melted
although i dont think i would recommend the brownie i will certainly be back for happy hour
it was very basic
they call you by your name every single time and were nothing but smiles
unfortunately it was just too sweet
i was never asked how my meal was and never asked if i wanted a refill on my drink
i love quiznos but was not a fan of this location
die stube ist nicht gerade schn ausgeleuchtet
for one order of chicken katsu curry with rice and coleslaw we paid around 1000
not bad but i dont get the hype
as always the food and service were great
the one i had prior at sushi style was pitiful in comparison
the pudding was a lot thicker than i would have liked but still tasty
we reminded them of it as they brought the others but sure enough a few minutes later they returned and admitted the order hadnt been put through
if your looking for for gourmet pizza keep looking
you know how i feel about giving out 5 stars so you know its good
thanks burger king for the unsanitary conditions and tolerating a public health hazard
the salty and crunchy skins marched well with the smokey honey dipping sauce
my biggest complain about that is that if all of those walls were knocked down and all of the rooms were eliminated they could probably seat another 200 people at any given time which would alleviate the wait in the line but getting more people in at once
a porcine server suggested we try the other side of the restaurant where it would be quieter so the baby could keep sleeping
i came here for lunch a couple of days ago with a client
they also serve  breakfast and the prices looked very reasonable for fountain hills so we will go back to see if its better than the dinner menu
you can taste the house made in these bagels
good sized tables and booths for meeting and talking about stuff with coworkers etc
fyi make reservations
we agreed to that
i would also suggest the rice pudding which is spiced with saffron and cardamom sometimes sneak it into your takeout for free
great place for lunch and dinner
if youre a fan of seafood in general and especially raw seafood you want your restaurant of choice to hit the mark every single time
yep eyes and lip still attached
prices range from 4 to 6
maybe because i get the ranch theyre fresher
guacamole prepared right in front of you for an appetizer is also a must
the service and desserts were wonderful
but being a dim sum fanatic i still go even if i cant speak to them
beef bison chicken  veggie and pulled pork are the options amongst the burgers
the food is tasty always fresh
the soup was probably my favorite part of this dish
we went for lunch
my only complaint for all the los locations would be that sometimes you get dry tortilla
our server kept hounding me to fill out some kind of survey on an ipad saying it would only take a minute when it took much much longer
after putting our name for i table i decided to peek into rakuwhich surprisingly had open tables and an empty bar
also had the vegetable raviolis which were absolutely divine
once we caught it the result was mixed to say the least
die bedienung ist tatschlich etwas unfreundlich und schlecht gelaunt
im pretty picky is amazing
i take the pics for fun not
toppings were great time and service were wonderful
melt in your mouth
nothing to see here folks  move along
service was a 55 as well our server was very patient since witness our first time and even offered recommendations
stopped by for lunch after a long vegas night
i decided for queens feast 2013 my friends an i would try sullivans
reminds me of those familyowned italian neighborhood food places we really loved in brooklyn the place has that authentic vibe  is the 1 italian deli in vegas thats like the ones back east
i had the street tacos and they were amazing
im a fan
i like sushi but im not an aficionado
i feel like they were tostitos
the buratta the steak tartar the made to order bread and the pasta
my husband ordered corn on the cob 14 of an ear for 200 and no butter and we both had cole slaw
if your looking for fine dining go downtown scottsdale
which left us wondering just what that meant
the medallions should have been cooked medium
im not too big on writing reviews but im pretty irked with this place
everything seems to be local
im usually skeptical to try out these little neighborhood pizza joints because of past bad experiences
everything considered i wont be back
huge salads nice sandwiches good price point
perhaps this can be explained by lack of experience
note to the ownersmanagers my tiny group and i agree that although you have problems no matter how big never
i was staying at planet hollywood and the miracle mile mall is right next door
service was amazing
and the service is not good at all
the way the dishes are cooked are suited for vert americanized chinese taste buds
i have always been fascinated by the brewing process and all the different kinds of beer there are in the world
we didnt tip very much since we had like 5 different girls help usor something like that
we got our order to go but the restaurant appeared clean
the only reason why it gets 4 stars is because the restaurant isnt super clean
theyll make your order pretty quickly but if you want to be superefficient you can phone in your order in advance
overall  i didnt enjoy the food
this place is the bomb always fast and always delicious
well not long after the train of wait staff brought out their million dishes we recieved ours both our waiter jason i believe and the manager im assuming came and told us that dessert was on them sweet
the 2nd time was about 20 minutes and they 3rd time the quickest wait was only like 10 minutes
we will definitely be returning
price 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine80 not including gratuity
i have been to johnny mango a handful of time for brunch lunch and dinner
since it was only 820 am
there specials are mi quang and bun bo hue
on to the meal  we both had the socalled snow crab cakeswhich should rightly be called potato croquettes with specks of crabtotally unremarkable and false advertising to boot
the only reason i did not give it a 5 star is because the burrito artist neglected to ask if my brother wanted tortilla crunchies in his burrito and he was crushed to find out his burrito was crunchieless
this poor chicken died just to be half eaten and the rest discarded
im usually underwhelmed andor turned off by the standard franchise gimmick but it didnt feel like that tonight
a very interesting place cool art everywhere and might i add that as huge fans of paninis theirs were just the best weve had
i will have to come again to give a better review
if youre set on eating turkish there may be other places that does it better
will stop there on every trip to vegas
i tried both
the pesto dish was extremely good
my comment about all the noodle bowls is that the broth is super tasty
the alex was great keep it up man
loved the birds too
it was garbage
they havent changed the menu in so many years
you just get to drive up press a button and order whatever youd like off of their tasty menu
service has always been friendly and consistent while also helpful
service was quick and the lady was friendly
the kang hoh was less vinegary than renu nakorns a good thing but contained something resembling overcooked beef stew meat not pork as listed on the menu
but overall the food was tasty
the decor is nice and clean you can tell attention to detail is important to the owner
steaks were amazing and the appetizer was tasty
the sauce the cheese the toppings
the counter and kitchen seem overwhelmed and orders come out wrong or missing toppings
i see on the side they sell prepackaged chocolate that are all more expensive than godiva  if i thought you were worth it maybe i would come back but sorry this isnt holts so dont expect customers to pay the price
the place seemed clean although i didnt check out the bathrooms but i would imagine they should be ok at this point in the lifecycle of the restaurant
the salsachips were okay
stopped in for lunch for the first time
highly recommend this place
im a sucker for a good burger
wrapping up a lengthy yet fun late lunch we shared a piece of red velvet layer cake and an apple torte
the dough was extremely thick and there was very limited meat
the squid was perfectly cooked soft tender and just melted in your mouth
took 2 busses to get here from the strip and welk worth it
candace the bartender is great
i am so glad to finally check off bob
christina was an amazing server
pasta salad was not my favorite
the chicken didnt seem freshly made and the skin on top was like a sheet of rubber
after 10 minutes i asked again and one guy said they were still defrosting it
the service was fine while we were seated at the table and ordering from the menu but when we were perusing the wine selection looking for some gifts and bottles to take home no one offered to help us
they also do take out if you are looking for a night in with great food
the only stardocking drawback was the price
beers are serious and food is very consistent
after seeing the wizard of oz at the smith center we decided to grab a bite downtown
its a little different presentation indian food in a mexican burrito but the flavor is very good
next time ill try the eclair for dessert and update the review
it wasnt bad but its definitely not the greatest
the bill for all and our carafe of sangria about 5 wine glasses or maybe 6 depending on how much you pour was 13500 or so
das ergebnis war ein traum
theyll rip you off with cheap mediocre food
lolos tickles me pink
no good flavor and somehow a horrible after taste
walking in the music is not to loud there is a bit of a wait except for the bar which we ran to  happy hour is minimal some small thin things to entice your palette chose the firestone a very lovely beer
we would be seated downstairs in the kitchen
lame service and the cook and server need to go
dont assume because they have other successful norske nooks this one doesnt need work  effort to make it
i think perhaps they wanted their tofu to resemble meat but it was dry like a piece of tofu jerky and completely tasteless
staff is miserably slow
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best
ill definitely be back
they were very tasty
the food is good too
inside the shop theres star wars walking dead and a lot of awesome art to look at
my chicken was very bland
it just didnt go well together
the location is perfect for north strip employees to grab a bite off strip and for off site meetings with it being very accessible from the airport
thats right every tuesday pop on over to angels trumpet for a massive hearty downhome tv dinner served on an actual compartmentalized tray filled with good old fashioned comfort food
this place is now at the top of our list
still furama is a reasonable choice when youre looking for chinese and vietnamese baked goods and desserts
loved the 20 coupon offered that yelp links too as well
just try harder guys
i really thought of giving this place 4 stars due solely on desserts but if i gave it 4 stars did the 2006 version of the wynn buffet deserve 7 stars
i recommend you spend your hard earned money elsewhere
they refilled my water often and quickly accommodated our requests for more soy sauce and even what the weather was supposed to be for the next day
so my friend explained what happen and again and this person had the same response and walked into the kitchen
we stopped here for lunch because they were running a special launching a new menu item hokkein street noodles
the old saying you are what you eat is right on
i hate to make the comparison but theyre like a better version of chipotle
the fries are crisp and very large portioned
i will definitely be back
lucky for this place their burger was great  other bartenders were friendly
freshly baked and warm and the hummus was authentic
a cocktail lover will be positively euphoric upon setting eyes on the list of treats in this place
we were constantly bombarded with people talking about the food and drink menus asking us if our food was good
the tacos were flavourful with fresh house made ingredients but not the best of what the city has to offer right now
i went with the sage fried chicken and waffels
i dont think ive ever been treated this poorly in any asian restaurant
i recommend the fried milk dessert pumpkin mock sharkfin soup classic sweet and sour pork you wont believe its not meat
some top show stoppers were vegetable korma paneer idli sambar veg pakoras bhelpuri and naan
and my taco plate was around 10 too
we have been to flemings across the country numerous times
i was pleasantly surprised
my only complaint would be that the prime rib was a little cooler than it should be
the hanger steak was a little chewy for my liking im not the biggest steak fan though served with a potato risotto which was perfectly fine
these had a pleasant yet mild flavor but not as spicy as i had hoped so why the three stars
the ladies were s nice
came here for the first time today
went to pf changs for my sister in laws birthday
it was a really nice decor
the chicken was obviously a frozen reheat
talk about wonder woman
eat somewhere else
the first two were very very good and the third was ok the jerky was excellent and not too tough
the food here is simply amazing
had the tater tots
we meant to go to pampas for the cheap steak n eggs but ended up here due to their better prices
staff sucks obviously just wanted to go home
you wont regret it
oh and its open for food till later in the night
the atmosphere is not what i expected
the lasagne had a nice mild overall flavor slightly bland
the italian and meatball sandwiches are my favorite
fast and friendly service and delicious food
a cute little restaurant with some very good food
im a meat and carb girl so i loaded up on the protein
like i said im not a huge fan of indian food but i ordered the chicken tikka and i loved it
if you are a whiskey connoisseur youre sol
i would definitely return
the staff is extra friendly and they always make me feel welcome
the wait staff will be as stuffy or as relaxed as you let them be
take the kids to the chefs table at the napa rose at the grand californian where 11  14 year olds are very welcomed
troy was out waiter he was very politeand prompt with the service even with the kitchen backed up
first i was by myself with a book for company
our server rae was amazing
chicken fingers are generally a kids meal but canes makes it an adult feast
there comes a point where a server should come to tell the customer hey the kitchens really backed up were sorry
hit this spot when you are ready to throw down and grab an uber back
just make sure you go with a big appetite if not i recommend the chefs bento box it is very similar to the omakase just a few less courses
what an amazing concept
entrees wagyu filet wagyu skirt steak and wagyu strip with potato puree roasted peppers and brentwood sweet corn as sides
they truly have a noteworthy pastry chef who dazzled with creations like butterscotch parfaits salted caramel macadamia nut whoopie pies and sour cherry nut clusters
so gut wie im chinapalast habe ich noch niemals chinesisch gegessen
im not sure its fair to compare this place to kbowl but the ambience service and food was much much better in my opinion
keep up the great work
on a gin tonic  was very cool
i rate their burgers better than five guys  and smashburger but on a different level than inout
the black bean soup is almost fat free and the best ive ever had
i specifically ordered the lemon tart which was combined with some sour cherry concoction and was truly delicious
they were bloody red which wasnt what i ordered
for one yogurt and a drink it came to almost 1000
most of the negative reviews seem to be based on the fact that these people didnt know what they were doing
came back and almost dropped dead of caprese nirvana
my husband and i came in around 11am and they were serving their brunch menu
take a photo of that too
review for kaskade during labor day weekend understaffed nice decor  ambience its a pretty large pool and lots of cabanas  vip areas
je suis tombe  la renverse en mordant dans un taco  la fleur de courgette
we sat for about 5 minutes before anyone said hello and finally pete showed up
anyhow great place for some korean grub if youre hungry
i got a pesto shrimp spaghetti which almost tasted like nothing
service was quick attentive and very friendly
but after we reasoned with her the system was miraculously restored
sweet and spicy at the same time
first there were probably as many people in staff as there were eating
we decided to try this place out after reading all the great brunch reviews
not sure if the rest of theaters were this way but this one was
they have other locally made products as well  soaps pastas skin care products accessories and more
while the meal took 4 hours it flew by because of the wellorchestrated and choreographed talents of the kitchen and restaurant staff
we were hoping that the foodservice would make up for the atmosphere
for about hour and half of wait and 32 its not much better than chinese buffet you see any strip malls that cost 12
the bar was also cluttered dirty and mostly unattended
if i could give a zero star rating i would
nothing special and not bad
favorite dishes are the kim chi calamari and the lobster bisque is insane
didnt have a chance to try any desserts this time
simple good food
my usual order has been an 18 white pie 22 with added caramelized onions pepperoni and mushrooms
i ordered the shrimp and grits and a mint julep
which i paid
my wife and i shared the jambalaya for dinner it was very very good
pros drive thru inexpensive quick food is good for what you pay for coke products and friendly people
better than pyramid
and my first bite into this dish i was truly delighted
not much of an ayce sushi joint type person and this place definitely hit the spot
tip concord on a saturday night is the worstso be sure to add about 20min to your travel time
he said the sauce was sweet and sour like with a kick of chili spice
not the plastic sushi you get is scottsdale but the familyrun small business version that makes america great
ambiance was nice
i really liked the flavor of the seasoning used in the breading on the chicken
thanks for a great experience
as i left a doorman was getting set up to clearly welcome clubbers in a few hours
i only wish that there were some pickled carrots and radish on the side to cut through the fattiness and oily texture
like i said it was a big order and only half was eaten
they do give a lot of meat and i had a hard time eating the gyro so i eventually dumped everything out on top of my salad
my boyfriend and i discovered this little gem while on the way home from the grand canyon
cool lounge music makes you relaxed
if you think our service was bad during our ordeal another table of 6 was seated behind us and they left after waiting more than 15 minutes for wait staff that never came around to even take their drink orders
but i feel like you get your moneys worth for sure
hours are 4pm  10pm and this place is always busy but the flow of clients in and out is fast
the absolute best chinese food in arizona
will be back with all my friends
now that i have gotten the warning out of the way i can brag about the food
i would come back next time
coffee with almond milk completes my meal
came here on a wednesday night and it wasnt busy at all compared to a weekend night
the henry inside the cosmopolitan is a 247 diner with lounge and table seating
seriously authentic italian food housed in what looks to be a former circle k  sneaky
lots of good sandwiches to choose from
despite it looking nicer than some other campus bars its really just that its newer im sure you are still going to run into some silly silly people
a confusing pricey all over the place menu that only a wannabe foodie could love
we ordered the chilli chicken dry and vegetable fried rice for pick up
for the first drink we waited 20mins after that we decided to go to the bar to have our drink kylie was really eficient and serve us right a way
not much else i can say about the place
the shop itself had a wee make over last year and looks great inside perfect to sit and escape the busy streets
overall this is 5 for me in charlotte
portions the portion sizes as many have already stated are gigantic
and are near philly a sub mecca so i have high standards for subs
je ne le recommande pas
but the last few visit have been more then unpleasant at this location there was two managers i spoke with today first being the female manager that seemed if she couldnt be bothered to take my order very rude an snappy during the whole order
as a bbq guy that both eats and cooks it
burrito for the not so big eaters as its still a decent size
now i will only go here after my friend took me here a few months ago
it has a cute interior and the employees working that day were very nice and helpful in answering my veg questions
i could only purchase a whole cake for 10 so a quarter slice would cost around 250
update 12112016as wonderful as always
theres upchuck e cheese for that
i took home a piece containing walnuts and was surprised to discover three thin layers of puff pastry two layers of nut filling and a remarkably aromatic rose water soaking syrup
a 30minute infomercial on new cars
2 cheese platter 2 cheeses bread with a few nuts and spreads
while it was a bit challenging to eat in the dark thats of course all part of the experience and you cant be afraid to get your hands a bit messy unless youre really that good aiming a fork and knife without the benefit of your eyes
the room was so packed that even the servers didnt make it to our table once to refill our water i did it myself
i had the fish and chips
they are very expensive and nothing all that great
we sat and waited clearly finished for our check and finally had to get up and ask for it
the interior of the restaurant is very white giving the impression its very large and spacious with interesting paintings on the wall
its a very small place  about 10 tables inside and a few on the front side walk
seriously as a lapsed vegetarian i love the food here
we also got a small order of the doughnuts which were hot and delicious
thats ok in america but come on you get a weekly wage
green is good
drink menu was great
he has the manager jay come out
this time the seabass on drunken noodle was good but the fish was as crisp and juicy as our first endevour
a well concocted menu in a prime location
it was a luau gone wrong
the service was great
ugh what a disappointment
if you want to go i would recommend visiting on a weekday around 2 pm
the dinner menu is vast starting with their tapas style appetizers and moving on to the usual suspects
the sign of a good restaurant so its hard to complain
highly recommend this restaurant for health conscious consumers who want there food to taste fresh and delicious
i liked them all though i found some chicken pieces to be hard but overall taste was good
i tried the 3 amigos which had salmon tuna and yellowtail with red onion cilantro and wasabi aioli
the place was pretty empty for a friday night
got our bill quickly and departed on a good note
ill dine again but definitely not at this location
sashimi was fresh service friendly atmosphere nice
environment small eatery but very clean
today was coconut
little did we know we were launching the best chain sub sandwich restaurant ever
the ramen was very flavourful and quite heavy without being overly salty
its actually a steakhouse
wtf is that about
maybe i was expecting too much
a little disappointed went back this weekend and dined here again for lunch
his name it bruce a  read his review too
entertainment was so much fun
they are 24 hours so be my guest
we have so many fabulous pizza places in the valley but for me this is definitely not one of them
every time we arrive to pick up our order the order is wrong or they have run out of an item
2nd course lobster was bland filet was cooked not per order and incorrect rice was delivered
the green curry is decent dont bother with the pad thai the noodles are too gummy and its just not authentic for my tastes
there is also a dedicated section for wholesaler for pick up and ordering but it wasnt in the way of the general public browsing through and making purchases
i recommend breakfast menu
just a great local spot to hang out with friends
i ended up taking my time and enjoyed my food
my wife thought her bolognese was outstanding
i got the detox island green and was pretty disappointed with it
my sister asked me to have dinner with her after spending all day in the er with my grandmother
but the girl who ran the cash register was sitting on the counter playing on her phone
darker woods an expansive bar an open kitchen
if you check in on yelp you get a glass of wine free
postagesized oldstyle hippie joint complete with emo folkie music playing in the background and a motley assortment of salvaged furniture all cobbled and slapped togethervegetarian mainssmoothiestisanes theyre not much for the real stuff fairtrade coffee
we wont be back for mediocre food at best
really two could have split one order
one curry portion goes well with two bowls of rice
personally dislike the experience here
lots of these places popping around vegas now
the shrimp came out and were delicious although they had a fairly scant amount of pistachios dusting them
even if you reserve a table they make you wait for so long
the service was superb and the mango salad was to die for
they have signs in the booths where you can change up the letters and we spent a whole 15 minutes writing our message
we also tried a rib and it was fantastic
employees were not at all helpful or friendly
first we ordered the thai tea and some fried dumpings
dont be mean
the three of us waited about half an hour to get seated
one day ill have to try a shot of authentic turkish raki a strong aniseflavoured liquor
went here for a pre game hookah session before we hit the strip
friends also thought the same
i would definitely let my friends know about this place and i would come back to try more of their dishes
it was thick and packed with flavor loaded with pine nuts and not overly drenched in olive oil
though i do not need to taste the pad thai again i will gladly return here to taste some more of their dishes
all the food had amazing texture and was very wellcooked
the best in town
also their rice pudding was fantastic
i like the coffee here much better than anywhere on mill or on campus though not as much as cartel which is a bit further of a walk when youre at asu
the whole place also smells like durian when we walked in
they lost the half star due to the noise level that seems to be  a part of a dining experience
crinkle fries were pretty good i dont complain much about fries as they are my favorite but i dont like steak fries too much because its like eating an entire potato  cane sauce was decent it was pretty much a hybrid of mayo based sauce mixed in with chili of some sort not too salty which is great with a little kick to it
please someone who oversees this place so something about your restaurant because i know for a fact im not the only person whos stopped coming in because of this
looks to be a popular mid week spot for professionals committing to more than an afterwork cocktail
it is awesome and so fresh and light
so delicious
i wish i hadnt filled up ill have to come back from denver for dessert sometime
wrong move and poor salesmanship
and i would totally come back and go thru the crappy wait and service all for that salted caramel white hot chocolate
from first walking in i liked the decor and that it was so brightly lit
our waitress was ok everyone was friendly and appeared to be trying hard
without a doubt the best burgers hotdogs and sandwiches in az  if not all of the usa
i will not be going back
the busboy was more attentive to us and it wasnt even busy in our section at all
the biggest negative here is the service
that usually is great for me because i hate when a restaurant gets in a rush to bang out orders
salmon tataki and white fish carpacio are really good
there are plenty of cleveland culinary treasure who would be more than happy to take your business and serve you food worth the expense
if i go back for it ill ask for it more well done
i may even find myself going out of my way to pick up some coffee from king coffee
id still love to try one but i probably will only try once more to get one
if you order an appetizer one day it may be totally different the next time
anyway the food was extremely bland as if they used no seasonings
omg the food was spectacular
we were told that all the beepers were dying and to return later to get one
its not like you need the table so stop rushing us
i could have done that myself for free
the wagyu steak was cold and chewy
i ordered the spooning relleno peppers with cheese and chorizo breaded and fried a huge plate with 2 relleno and rice and beans very tasty
it is refreshing to see creativity in combining textures and tastes and i want to support the yonaka artists in their tasty creations  you owe it to yourself to experience this wonderful  taste adventure
i have to write more
bought a living social dealvery pleased
aber den blick kann man auch so haben wenn man am see entlang schlendert fazit enttuschend ungemtlich berteuert hektische atmosphre weil die tische so klein und so nah beieinanderstehen
slow service unjustifiably arrogant attitude by the staff cold lobster hohum sides
i hope they can get their act together because this section of town could really use a new and exciting fine dining establishment
we are new to the area and decided to go eat at picazzos organic italian kitchen in goodyear this past weekend
we thought we had experienced honey toast before but not untile we came here
i feel like they missed the mark a bit on the seafood dishes we tried
i found this restaurant on yelp i cannot begin to say how very good the food was
not one bit
postino central winecafe  pretty cool history on postinos
the waiter who was actually the owner as he told us said  its a lunch although that was not denoted on the menu  which was kind of confusing in itself
their service was also great  the yelp checkin offer is only valid for one free dessert per table but the owner gave us two on the house
i liked the brisket the most it was amazing
im sure there are plenty of people that love the sandbar especially my inlaws but it is definitely not my kind of restaurant or bar
we always get the philly cheesesteaks and crab fries so i cant speak to the other menu items
i enjoyed the salmon entree with grilled asparagus and my hubby enjoyed the shrimp and grits
fortunately there is a winking lizard tavern there one of the eighteen locations of this northeastern ohio based chain
the pu pu platter looked like it had been leftover from someone elses order
we didnt know what to expect
food was better than average
ive had much better but i guess this will do when you are hungry
loved the burgers here had almost every one
just asked if we wanted something besides water
try the porkveal ravioli made with shallots
drawbacks very crowded which is actually a good sign
and is hard for any 1 person to eat their whole plate in one sitting
the meatballs were huge and the bread was fresh and it was loaded with mozzarella and parmesan cheese
i can understand a small juice but a large cup of juice being the same price as a cup of coffee
i randomly decided to go to pittsburgh while on a roadtrip and wandered into morcilla
on the way out we had to look around the souvenier area and picked up a few things
it took 20 min to get our water order in when the restaurant wasnt even packed
pretty easy to find off a main road from the outside it doesnt look like much and my husband started putting up a fight to even pull in
the combination of sweet juicy and crunchy makes makes bachi live up to the hype
these attitude of  workers ruined our dinner
i was a little bit overwhelmed at first
and to top it off these women just got up and left didnt notify an employee or anything
i absolutely love this place
i ordered a single patty with cheese and bacon and some fries
we arrived at about 5pm and the place was completely empty told the truth about no wait
it was the cool place in the warehouse district with the party atmosphere but it wasnt quite as packed as the velvet dog or the barley house
it is to die for
all in all well worth it
on last time in though they seem to have forgotten the roll part
highly recommend this place as well as the enchiladas
if you go id recommend the wings and the tri tip sandwich but steer clear of the combo plates
i came in to gamble and noticed a commotion at the bar
the mens room stunk a bit
this place is good
food was horrible
the service has always been great and no matter how busy they are the servers always stop to say hi and smile
the rolls were excellent as well and tasted very fresh
wouldve been nice to eat together but it wasnt a deal breaker
you can tell this place is more about corporate up selling as well you cant walk through the line without some poor under paid employee half heartfelt trying to push their over priced cookies and deserts on you
the best mexican food i have had since la this place makes authentic mexican food
we went to meet a few friends on the 5 steak and a beer night fully expecting swill and shoe leather and ended up having about an hour to kill due to late friends
the restaurant itself is set up so adorably
they have a rather large space and can accommodate quite a bit of people at any given time
we made a reservation about 2 hrs in advance and had no problems getting it
if she didnt have the brace on we cant imagine how serious tonights injury could have been
i thought the eggplant was mistakenly beef and i didnt eat it
i love this place
you wont be disappointed
i will be back soon with more to report i definitely have my eye on those improper nachos but in the meantime do your tummy a flavor and get there now
delivery was as stated 2030min
they were slammed and didnt think they could delivery under 90 minutes
i highly recomend it
you cant go wrong with pretty much anything though as everything ive tasted from here has been delish
what are kids doing in sin city
the negative reviews here are dead wrong or  written by people that dont know chicago dogs beefs or maxwell street polish served at a typical chi town hot dog stand
pretty good especially since the bread comes out hot
i imagine old town coffee house probably shines at breakfast
quality ingredients and family recipes
the owners are so sweet and kind
i love my american style cuisine
excellent food and staff
i had my reservations with au pied de cochon once i read the yelp
its perfectly spiced and some of the best fried chicken ive had  ever
i also really like what they did w the space formerly known as darcy magees
another of my vital hangover destinations you might be noticing a theme here
the service was so horrible that i actually complained to the manager which is very rare for me
at least i didnt eat a rubber band
friendly and quick
my food was fresh served with a friendly smile
i remember enjoying everything we had
first they have recently upgraded the food and cocktail which are worthy of the best restaurants in town
they have four or five beers on tap a wall worth of wine selection and some happy hour drink specials as well
the ugly i ordered a margherita flatbread
after telling the waitress that we could not eat the artichoke nor finish the eggplantnothing  was taken off the bill i hear they are closingit would be the best thing for them to doand throw the microwave out onto the railroad tracks
i picked the shoyu ramen with seaweed egg some bamboo shoots a piece of meat and scallions
it came out with sauted spinach which was so good
sidenote both locations have great atmosphere fun interior design and are clean
i didnt mind as much since we did get one of our meals for free
for desert we decided to have the fried zucchini bread and it was really good
yesterday i was at the applebees on 80th and bell
all the staff was very friendly and i expect by now theyre probably better at knowing whats what
the bulgogi was  super yummy and i loved all the side dishes that it came with
btw i felt so regret to choose the ice cream and sorbet as  dessert but not the cotta
dafr gibt es hier jetzt das unvermeidliche asiatische buffet
they have a parking lot in the back
i sent them back and to their credit the head chef came out to apologize
we are suddenly blessed by plethora of greekmediterranean choices in south charlotte and id rate this among the best
the penne ala vodka damn girl that was off the charts
the meats they toss in here arent typically what youd find on moms dinner table so make sure you read the menu and are cool with those
i have never had a bad pizza from here
we get it you took forever to open so things had to be rushed but downtown gilbert is always packed  there shouldve been more training and more staff
food  drinks theyve got the normal drinks like orange juice  coffee but they also have specialty juices
i ordered the chicken souvlaki with potato and rice
i see a new ad with a tostada that appears to have green goodness on it
this sandwich was very good compared to the drakester
i ordered the no
it feel like you are entering an indiana jones ride at disneyland
im going to give morning squeeze a strong three star review
whatever i came to see hot men and drink anyway
great value for money with the prix fixe menu and the service was excellent
i enjoyed it at first i second guessed my order thinking most likely it wasnt good be that good but i was impressed its wasnt like a original philly cheese steak the bread was different the meat also but it had great flavor
dont ever eat here
i am staying at the doubletree across the street from rbg grill which is located in the radisson hotel
bad service and bad burgers cancels out outstanding patio views
a serving of chicken paprikash is great in the fall or winter
this is a nice long bar counter copper or steel i cant remember but its well polished ergo very very shiny
thanks for a great dinner
i had the meatballs
so give yutaka a try
when we entered there was no one at the hostess stand nor any staff visible anywhere
the bad i have to agree with another reviewer that the ipads take away from the ordering experience
i must say that i have quite a liking towards expensive food
when im hungry and dont feel like cooking this is where i go
i couldnt slid it far enough away to not be nauseating
it was very flavorful and quite filling
we decided on delivery so we looked online at what they had to offer
dinner is more expensive
there are handfuls of great restaurants in the tremont ohio city area i cant wait for south side to close so there will be another pleasant addition
i ordered the angus ribeye
today for the grand opening the opening for dinner was pushed back 30 minutes without warning so many people were waiting outside and even after the 30 minutes delay ingredients were still not done being prepped for another 15 minutes or so
i love everything about this place
the shop holds maybe 20 people or fewer
been going here since birth
also you can get solidly good breakfast food especially if like me youre a fan of biscuits  gravy as well as decent selection of sandwiches  salad for lunch
the best thai food in the valley
i always make it a priority to visit this place at least once when im in vegas
the filling is complimentary to the shell
the price is more than affordable especially if youre feeding an entire family
at least the food will taste better
loud environment and groups are welcomed
come for the food and take some baklava to go
my friend got the mango stirfry with shrimp
not a ton of ambience here but all the staff are always friendly professional and the food gets served up pretty quickly
beef is high quality and cooked perfectly buns are really good too
yes there is only 2 sets of towels
the fish market has been here awhile and it is still going strong
there used to be sushi and spinach and a few other things but now those things are gone
i felt like i was in a little nyc joint
the clam chowder was soso and no better than what you might get at dennys
this was my second time to thai house
jerk chicken will set you back 1150 and if you want some delicious plantains theyll charge another 3
beef brisket on the other hand i was not impressed
make sure you go for a nice little walk after wards in the park
green tea was a little too creamy for my liking
i loaded my dog with ketchup tomato and a pickle
i recommend skipping this restaurant
i was with a group of 10 mostly men
cant wait for our next visit
the wait staff is helpful and cheerful
additionally there was literally only one vegetarian option on the whole menu which is surprising for a mexican jointwhere were the cheese enchiladas on the menu
the margheritas are great the staff is attentive and friendly
the woman singing even sang happy birthday to my friend after one iffy coworkers notified one if the employees
will be back to try other dishes
nice big glassbut had a lot of ice
it was really really good i ate everything
i liked the fries and tried the salt and vinegar seasoning
i knew they were doing well based on awesome reviews here but i never had the desire to try it again
first timers need to go up to the bar and get their into to chinos food tasting
die perfekte mglichkeit fr einen mittagstisch ausserhalb der kantine
this dinner includes vegetable soup  peking duck 2 courses scallop canned mushrooms with baby bok choy
i had a hard time deciding what i wanted to eat so i went with the spam masubi fried shrimp and the chicken and rib plate
these were also very tasty and came with a side of coleslaw
for the money its a nice place for a individual or couple to go to and have a good hot meal
after a morning run i chose the hearty koftatofu scramble and was not disappointed
if you want to talk about way way overpriced food try nobu
i would highly suggest you dont invest your time or money gordonramsay steak
i felt plenty of love and tradition baked into this dish
u get few  off
and when we got our bill he had told the waitress to take that roll off that wasnt included on ayce
the coconut tart and beer tarts had delicious fillings but the crust was too tough
love the shwarma
when we got our coke it tasted like it had root beer in it
we will never return to bravo
the meal wasnt cheap but was much cheaper than a similar one on the strip
and for 7
i will not be going back and neither will any of my coworkers
a suggestion  cook less cool good and keep the place clean and ventilated
the reviews are true this place rocks in a big way
parking is okay compared to their business
the food  a for effort and creativity but the overall taste wasnt to die for
my 7 ounce flos filet was adequately tender but didnt have enough of a  wallop in terms of flavor
its been several years since ive been to a buffet of this caliber so needless to say i was starved for the variety of options available at a smorgasbord like the one at aria
surprised to find a good greek place in the food court at a mall
youre better off getting mcdonalds breakfast at least their service is better
i have never seen cold crab legs anywhere but in  las vegas
great food at a low price
their salmon teriyaki bowl is it
lori is always neat professional  courteous and most of all a great server
the gentleman we had for a server tall dark guy and dont see his name on the receipt was very good and quick to refill water and wine
it dyed our teeth black and our fingers
my boyfriends food almost tasted like when someone uses a nonstick pan to cook without throwing through the dishwasher first
she was super friendly and was on top of our beverage refills while we waited 2 hours for our meal to be edible
the cheese was processed and flavourless mind you nearly all pizza joint cheese isnt actually cheese so i dont know that this sets them apart
highly recommended if youre in town your body will thank you
ive been here twice and everything weve tried has been tasty
great breakfasts for those who dont eat meat as well
met up with a few close friends to celebrate the gfs birthday
prices are fair
everything was a winner
i take it home and the bread is stale and hard
the service was great
mary  joseph really no pun intended took care of us at the bar w a grey goose martini up for him and an appletini for moi
so we decided to place an order via amazon restaurants
however the outer rim of my pizza was pretty badly burnt and tasted awful
enough said delicious ribswet ribs with a nice amount of meat on each solid dish stuffed poblano peppermight have been my favorite dish of the night and very filling mac  cheesevery creamy and you get that hint of smoked pepper i am drawing a blank of the last few but i think we doubled up on 1 or 2 of the ones i mentioned
i ordered the tuesday special  two falafel wraps for 699  the new owner said he had not seen me there yet and gave me a single falafel to try while i waited
this used to be an oxygen bar with red swirly sofas and ottomans
the salad was coated in a red wine read raw onion vinaigrette  buyer beware  my head turned in to a breathing onion odorizer
earls opens up the big windows on nice days
i like dave  busters
i am most definately a fan of sonoma grille and would recommend it to all nonfoodies and foodies who can truly appreciate the difference in styles of food culture and atmosphere and a great time
that was the best part of being there in my opinion
i only tried the jerk chicken which was moist and flavourful
we ordered mango lassie which was twice the size of any lassie we had before price however was 350
we came saturday morning at 930  it only took 10 minutes to seat us
i ordered the el diablo burger added bacon and jalapeos
could you provide a name so i am able to address this situation correctly and according
save yourself a trip and go somewhere else
joshua the hibachi master was hillarious
of course if you know some chinese its helpful but you can always look at each dish before deciding anyhow
did i mention this 3 course dinner was 20000
we shared the lunch prix fixe 20 includes app pizza of your choice and dessert and it was plenty
she shushed us
than other curries from competitors but it seemed more authentic to me
i am still daydreaming about the pimento cheeseyum  they run fun promos from time to time like free zoes cups bring them back in and the drinks are just 99 cents
another favorite is the habanero wings you get a ton of wings since its an appetizer and the sauce is sweet and spicy
the ladies restroom was a pleasant surprise
great pizza in gastonia
the staff is as warm and friendly as the food is out of this world
i dont know how health inspections work in north carolina but i do assist in health inspections in michigan and if i saw that kind of infestation locally i would shut this place down
but from my experience in the food industry and customer service i was a bit shocked what we experienced without much effort to right the wrongs
i also had a chai latte here
lastly the staff doesnt strike me as the friendliest around
get some yakitoritempuramaki rolls for 13 each
great dish btw it delivered and was bomb
our waitress was very attentive and thank goodness cause that jerk snuck up on me and slapped me like 3 times lol but it was worth it
i ended up getting my bagel togo so i can chow it down at work
if you want some authentic italian pizza with good ingredients order here
but inattentive and slow
so lets just pull the bandaid off
and i like the 5 footlong promotions but i just cant bring myself to try the mortadella
i had about an hour give or take
we ordered i dont remember the exact names the pub sliders pretzel sticks and the fish and chips
it does get crowded from time to time but they have an outdoor patio
their kfc is better than bonchon
the people are pretty and well dressed
best italian beefs on the planet
the lady at eat24 tells me they are refunding me and just confirmed it will be another 45 minutes
the service is friendly
we made our reservation for new years eve after viewing the menu online and from the look of it there were many options for appetizers entrees salads etc
die neuen haben den kleinen gastraum komplett zum positiven umgestaltet kleine tischchen mit geschmackvoller deko angenehme musik
there are definitely better korean food for the money
next time i am going to try the steak tartare i love you jacobs
after the cake and with our bills on the table we waited 45 min just to pay
the sirloin was overcooked and the gnocchi portion was tiny
our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the spaghetti al anatra its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish
portion and price was impressively affordable
the pieces fish were chilled not warm like in some places we went to and exquisitely sliced in large portions some places do a hack job
the sushi which wasnt all that went away
also itd be great if this place did get a little bit more diverse
may who we had spoken to several times told us there was nothing they could do about it now because its the driver that messed up and was supposed to come here first
nothing remarkable about the food or the service
the ramen i got was the nagoya style with chashu  supposedly the heaviest and most flavorful of the choices available
this was my first time here and will definitely be my last
came here on a friday afternoon around 5pm
except the vig is only meh
highly recommended for parties upstairs
came with the house salad
giving this place 4 stars for the good food
sure i can get a fantastic one entree meal somewhere for the price but sometimes i just want to try everything like a little fatty girl
we ordered our pizza at 710 and it didnt arrive until after 900  i called several times and was told it was on the way
it was very tendor although it also did still manage to retain some of the gaminess from the soup
mine tasted a bit off kind of mustymoldy
the meat in the beef teriyaki was mushy and had strange texture to it my friend had to ask if they could cook it some more but came back out the same
the spinakopita was very good done perfectly
the eggplant itself was weird
thank goodness we have yelp to alert those savvy travelers
and my compliments to the chefs
after experiencing just a taste of what this truck had to offer i had to splurge for the maple and bacon glazed donuts
the ambience is almost a country chic with hip decor
pretty good i suppose but the beef pho was a bit bland and lacked color i wouldve liked to have seen some veggies in there rather than just a few pieces of beef broth and noodles
she even let us know she will be there until 1215am so we dont have to rush there
the shrimp was pretty good but it took a while for a starter
lots of free toppings to choose from
all around the worst fast food joint in anthem
also weve bought their bread and little holiday goodies and they were amazing too
just seemed like some fancied up bar food  and maybe hit a miss that night with the kitchen
its a nice addition to the markham area
we went yesterday for christmas dinner and were visited by chef seonkyoung who came across as incredibly humble and genuine
well to answer that no seasoning
everything was on time when we arrived
heart attack city disguised in greens and other leafy matter
after the food was brought out our waitress walked by 3 times without checking on us
musubis are simple and normally delicious but i dont like the way they make theirs
will definitely come back
the biryanis were extremely tasty and were in ample proportions
so we stay and keep to ourselves
plus the service was top notch
im looking forward to the next time im back on this side of town
love this placeso much better than that other burrito joint
i havent eaten in the restaurant itself because im such a messy eater and no one wants to see me eat ribs in public but while waiting for takeout i notice that it has a fun lively vibe especially in the summer when the front is open to the street
so far here are the dishes that we ordered very delicious entree house fried rice binagoongan fried rice crispy binagoongan  bistek tagalog lechon kawali ginataang sitaw at kalabasa  crispy pata  not so good or just ok pork sinigang not that tasty bicol express first time ive seen bicol express that looks like adobong pusit grilled liempo for some reason it has that after taste that is not pleasing  the one star that i didnt give is the food that not quite good
in addition the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains
good happy hour deals
i had the chicken pita with a mountain of fries for just 795
love their catfish baskets but customer service is hit or miss
i didnt like the food or atmosphere here
overall the ambiance and the service was really good we will be returning sg is a higher nicer than you then other pts and other sierra golds
my go to location d
ok it took a bit but we returned to pab
ive had kaiseki in japan where the dishes are also simply prepared but with much more detail to flavor combinations for example a simple mushroom dish would come with 1 large bean and one vegetable in a simple sauce
im not going to waste my time and write a five page review about this stupid place
i found the prices a little bit on the high side but i would certainly return for lunch
also had asked about the milkshakes and as i was requesting something that wasnt on the menu our server told me that it was unfortunately not available however she agreed it was a flavour that should be available
who knows maybe it was because this is such a new mcdonalds and everyone wants to go here
great pizza and friendly service
the salad was so good and to top it off the had anchovies like a true caesar salad
i ordered a mac n cheese sandwich tasted like nothing
after dinner my guy asked me if i would go back
my patty melt was also very delicious and savory
heres the deal
i do like the texas toast
good what ever it was
the hostess said it would be 1520 minutes and it was 15 minutes awesome
if you want somewhere to mingle and meet new people this is not it
great views outside the windows of the banquet hall with excellent staff
dishes didnt have a lot of flavor to them and seemed like they were just average all around from temperature presentation and taste
have it your way
from what ive had here i can say that kabuki is an incredibly decent establishment that far surpasses a two to three star rating
she had not stop talking about the ham  cheese crepe she had here last year
just a note if you know you have an addiction to earl i would highly advise staying at a hotel far away from planet hollywood or else youll soon find yourself blowing money not at the casinosbut at earls
not its not just the best entre at this restaurant its literally the best country in the world
i always order the steak kabob platter
weve eaten here dozens of times
im troubled to give it a 2 or 3 but ill go with the 3 because its just so freakin cheap
the service was relaxed and personal  the chef even came by to ask how our dishes were
where is the consistency
finally we got a veggie pizza which was also just ok all in all 3 stars or aok
i mean dont get me wrong  the food is authentic mexican
and the food is fantastic
food is wonderful
i wouldnt dock stars for disinterested employees at a mcdonalds so i wont do it here
so i would recommend just getting their popular dishes theres a page in their menu for popular items because their other dishes are not up to par
i ate a small personal size pizza with pepperoni sausage green pepper and onions
on my last visit the waiter dropped sushi in my lap when it was finally replaced it was awful and then we had to wait 25 minutes for the checkand no it wasnt very busy
its got a great view and the menu just feels fancy
i had the vegetarian pasta which was about cheesecake factory quality  not terrible but not impressive at all
overall mediocre experience but one of the convenient restaurants to go to  if youre going to watch a show at the mirage
love the waiter there
well there were red onions all over the salad i had to pick off and some type of shallots or other similar onion relative chopped into small pieces that could not be separated
and there was a piano player which added to the already classy atmosphere
if someone was ever looking for a home made breakfast in a restaurant look no further
but the good was only ok  our table had the house made lasagna which was overly rich and lacked enough sauce to give the noodles some content
carlitos is a wonderful local place that everyone should check out
on a weeknight the place was not busy so the man behind the counter helped me right away
this is the only place in charlotte where i can get consistently good cappuccinos
they get fresh fish and steak shipped in from different parts of the world
tuna tataki is also another excellent item on their menu cons  service is a bit slow
the portion size is pretty small as well  but youd think youd get more for the price youre paying
for this reason i decided to try the scallops and the short rib stroganoff
we waited 20 minutes for our order meanwhile we could see her standing there laughing and talking with other employees
expect 1hr if you go for lunch break
triple george absolutely fit the bill
i suspect that its cheaper for them and possibly for the customer
chips and two salsas came soon and they were not hot so most people can eat them the chips were fresh and crisp
it seems that in the evenings this place is very quiet but i am sure the lunchtime crowd is huge with its location close to falcon field boeing and apache helicopter
unfortunately 1199 doesnt get you too much in an allyoucan eat veggie buffet
ive tried the nest egg for breakfast which was a great deal
also my husband was walking with our daughter when the ordering was starting and needed an extra minute
and of course thats the only one in vegasi gotra move back to la to get this deliciousness in my life  d
only one thing iu think i would like would be a fresh salad bar as well
the smokyness was very nice and powerful which i really liked
not loud with music rather conversation
he was so busy but was right there to check on us and be friendly
this was her pick so i know it has to be good after all she picked me order guacamole and humus appetizer  the street corn a shrimp and a duck taco
we were visiting montreal for a week and tried this last night
it actually taste better imo
just average food
hier komm ich auf jeden fall wieder her
meh i have had way better
will tell my friends
you did me right this time tao
top lokal super italiener
as usual they make up for the lack of decor and intimacy with very competitive drink specials and food items
one of the best meals i have had in recent memory
sitting here now its been one hour since we ordered 2 appetizers
id recommend this place for sure
this place was great
i have to say she had to have been the rudest waitress ive had to deal with in my life
warning do not wear your best clothes here and come here prepared to get disgustingly messy but its worth it
the honeylime cilantro aioli paired perfectly with the fritters
im from texas houston to be exact so ive had plenty of mexican food in my lifetime
unfortunately it was so awful that both me and my friend had to send our drinks back
it definitely sated my cravings for brisket thats for sure
the delicious fried calamari was gone from the menu and replaced with a bruschetta made with a tiny sliver of prosciutto cream cheese and jam
arribas rates their spice level by a rating scale of 13 peppers
not really a major issue but not as smooth as it could have been
if mad men were a restaurant it would be durants
when my husband and i moved we were sad to be leaving our beloved pizza shop in bloomfield
the sushi was worse than gas station sushi
finally i told what i think was the owner or manager and he said he would do it
however since im being precise i thought i would point it out
yall need to close down
if you value customer service  do not go here
my husband then ordered the mac and cheese entre with a regular salad and mashed potatoes on the side
second star is for the bowling alley
and a cherry lemon sundrop
apple pie oatmeal crumble cinnamon ice cream caramel sauce the oatmeal crumble was a nice touch but i didnt love the crust or the apple filling
i get the feeling that this is a restaurant that people come to more for the drinks and the atmosphere than the food
we were seated within 10 minutes
we came from south gilbert for no other reason than to come here
worth the wait in line
i hope it changes
acid jazz impeccably clean and tastefully modern
then it took an additional 30 minutes to get our check
the food was great and the atmosphere was awesome
the garlic tuna and cajun albacore are must tries
13 soft shelled crab appetizer special deep fried  lightly battered lots of meat  great dish
in any case it was a nice side to go along with the breaded and fried meat
several dishes that i thoroughly enjoyed include enoki mushrooms with bacon poached egg with uni kikusui their specialty fish asajime chicken hamachi belly kobe beef liver sashimi and fluffy cheese cake
its not bad but it didnt scratch the itch i get when i crave indian nor for my wife when she craves thai
i definitely was not impressed with this place
the other guest had a traditional pancake breakfast and it too was good
with arborinfused blanc tequila bay leaf syrup lime and a sherry salt rim this drink will kick start your flavorful ride the right way
i ordered the arsenal chicken salad
ive already went over the fantastic servers  chef kris so how about the rest of the chefs who make the food happen
oh nothis is now a fallen angel of a formerly heavenly restaurant
despite not receiving 5 stars i would still return with maybe more people to split the food
my company caters from maggianos every year on our of our busiest days
we really enjoyed the pasta and we are used to downtown food so that says a lot
the service is always great and we always leave happy
the concept appeared new and the food looked good but i dont know we never got to try it
but food was great
that being said i still wasnt impressed
like in hong kong the waitress are busy and impatient usually unavailable
my recommendation char kew tiao lor mee and laksa
the lobster tasted too fishy and the ravioli had a rubber chewy texture
i asked what the best things are on the menu he gave us ample choices and we decided to get an appetizer to share and an entree each respectively tamale chile relliano  mahi mahi you get a bread basket with 3 things
i read a comment about a pathetic 500 breakfast and could only think that he was at a different restaurant
id definitely go back and glad i popped my red robin cherry
braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel
daughter loved her caesar salad
food was greatbut their is a little issue
the service was good but the seats are really close together and it is really loud
no room for dessert but i really enjoyed fogo de chao and will certainly return to one of their many locations
can someone tell me what i am missing
i couldnt believe how tasty the shrimp was d if you like to eat shrimp youll appreciate the way they prepare their shrimp whether you eat the tail or not d i walked thru their kitchen to use the restroom
do not recommend this place
great for lunch or take out but a notch under what id expect for even the most basic dinner spot
we had lunch which involves a multiple choice menu
dont expect a cheap all you can eat menu here
we asked for 8 originally and then asked for 6 instead because 8 would be too many
i had a chicken burrito with all the fixings
we had the ayce traditional rolls
i choose this place over any fine dining japanese resto in the gta
obwohl wenig los war mussten wir relativ lange warten
save yourself some money and go somewhere else
i observed the waitresses walking around clueless trying to figure out whos order they had
found this place while searching for sushi
he explained that hed had to microwave the sake as ipho was not equipped with the proper sake heating equipment
that comes with yogurt house made granola dried and fresh fruit
a serious disappointment
come enjoy a bit of cajun food here in vegas
the food came out speedy
good price and portion
great place to eat and drink very nice and clean and the people are friendly
bravo jimmy  joes
it was a bit pricey for a mexican restaurant but it is also considered upscale whatever that means this is vegas were talking about
no worries though simply ask and you shall receive
youve never had a milk tea until youve had one filled with boba and topped off with their sea salt cream
i was very skeptical when i walked in and ordered
i got the beef noodle soup and the person i was with got the noodles with yellow curry
te flavors were really good the right things were spicy and some more mild
the steak was a little on the tougher side
the chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served
also the bok choy served with my entree seemed a bit limp when served and there was a piece of skin underneath my salmon
ill be back because i really want to try the other menu items
service nice and owner nice but the terms best and authentic
do not eat here
the restaurant offers great views and even though we didnt get to try it we heard the high praise of their cheese cake
great food tonight havent been in a while new menu items very nice had ribs needed a tad more sauce but very good
i appreciate the huge assortment of sushi you can order on the all you can eat menu from sashimi to rolls to your dependable appetizers like potstickers and sunomono
we had lunch here today and we will be back
the mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the broth was delicious
dinnerwho knew that the bunch place was open for dinner
die probier platte war die kulinarische faust aufs auge sehr stimmig
one of my favourite features about cloisters is that the only noise comes from the customers conversations
go on guys
i wouldnt recommend any of them the tots were fried dried bits and the pickles had a chewy coating
i love the other giuseppes and because of that the anthem location earned a visit
asada tacos are okay
cream corn and lobster  this is probably my favorite dish
the service was solid and the drinks were on point
the guac was most disappointing to me  it was way too mild for my taste and pretty expensive
it tasted like a crumbly tough corn dog
you will not be disappointed
all our food arrived hot and delicious
the food was just ok everything seems very basic
the best thing about it was it was all gluten free and just what the doctor ordered
you eat in a pitch dark room
went with a friend and the line was almost non existent  prices were fair  food was what you would expect mid day at a buffet
all of the staff was very pleasant but again id suggest asking for stephanie especially if you need help picking what you want to eat
one of my favourite places for ookonomiyaki
give it a try
there were a lot of menu items that caught my eye such as the kimchi bap poutine and tiramisu milkshake and ill definitely be coming back to try them
i promise to revisit this the next time we go
nice staff  good service but food didnt impress
and the martini well it is belvedere you dont need more explanations hello
saturday closing is at 3 pm so everybody can spend time with their families
or vice versa
went there tonight a saturday night at 8pm and the place was empty only 4 tables of people seated in the dining room and a couple of people at the bar
most items on there menu are 512 each
cedarlands tomato stewed okra is tender firm and not at all slimy
this location is a crap shot
the sides were great too
you can quickly see their cooking staff is passionate about cooking the best meal for each guest
the wine is quite good as well
its a little bit more expensive than some of the others that are nearby perhaps by 4 or 5 if youre going for lunch but its well worth spending the extra few dollars
most of the food i had tasted ok but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad
we overate ordering something like 1214 rolls for 2 people
it was quite a walk from the joint back to the hotel and along the way people were tryin to buy a slice for 10 bucks each
my husband and father in law ordered the sausage egg and cheese sandwich on brioche and i had a bite of it
just ordered a pizza at midnight i called it in the employee that answered said it would be an hour before i could get a pizza i could tell they didnt want to deliver so i asked for the manager
it was a really good balance of meat and vegetables and the salsa verde was amazing
not sure if the patties are cooked to order but it felt as if it was cooked earlier
the prices are on the high side for the amount of food you get
as should have the allies in september 1944
spicy pork and pineapple we ended up ordering another serving it was that good
my wife and i love this place
i was hesitant at first because of all of the options but the staff was friendly and patient
new to town and definitely found a great spot
a champagne and tea bar fun
i also got mustard and mayo which meant my sandwich was now swimming in mustard and mayo
went to another bar for drinks and was feeling a bit hungry so stopped in
like the fondue other minor things have changed that once gave strip house its own unique charm
the pizza was so bland i couldnt believe it was from sbarro
while this is not the best italian food ive ever had i would challenge anyone to find better at this price point
easy life boba is one of my favorites with its relatively low price friendly staff and great boba drinks
i would eat here every day if i could
kabuki kabuki it is always a go to place for my friends and fam especially since we live out in the west valley
from out of town and have heard about this place from friends
no crispness all softlike a pancake
der gastraum ist hell und freundlich
noodles galore and steamy buns
this is a really good south american street food place
sinon vous pouvez manger debout il y a des comptoirs haur
it wasnt bad just wasnt blow all your calories on it good
the salad was great and when i questioned my waitress about the quiche she advised it they make their quiche ahead of time and store them in the freezer yupi think next time ill have to opt for a less fancier and more diner  diner dive type of meal lol
like a dennys
definitely not the usual central phoenix crowd
the cook should have thrown it out
een beetje krap maar dat verhoogt dan ook wel weer de parijse sfeer zullen we maar zeggen
the beef jerky was delicious as was the deviled eggs which are the best ive ever had
and well be forever grateful for that one new year eve when naive me and friends neglected to make reservations for dinner
just fucking sad brown ooze topped with melted cheese
options were heavy and service was slow
the shawarma was even better this time how is that possible
fortunately its close to my house so i can satiate the postdrinking munchies that inevitably happen
im still eating and writing this review  i travel a lot for work and prefer not to rent a car so when im out its hard for me to find good places within a reasonable walkingcab distance
i call bs on these rave reviews
best hash browns ive ever had
i enjoyed it a lot and the beef tendons were very good and added a lot of flavor
the menu planning was done entirely online and confirmed with a phone call prior to us travellingthe food was outstandingmy father and uncle both sons of italian immigrants agreed wholeheartedly
fries and a shake are a must try
the stir fry cooked the food till it was burnt while attending to other task
did not like my beverages found them watery and the wine list is meh  the food is meh
maybe i should suggest to the manager to install a speed dry
the interior design of the restaurant is one of the reason why i wanted to try this place
after an hour and 20 minutes we were able to sit down
this is true customer service
the atmosphere is wonderful
nonetheless i told her i would come pick it up even though i wanted delivery
the service was amazing and very helpful as far as making suggestions when asked
my reason for the 4 star rating is because my food although delicious it came out cold
perfect combination of cheese and my daughter ate the entire serving which enough said there if she ate it all its good
not quite sure
all they care is customers money
the furniture is modern
favorite lunch spot
they have a beautiful patio area
the hapa sake was the best part of the meal
pizza was only ok the mushroom slice was the better of the two
soho maki bacon wrapped kurubota sausages stuffed mushrooms  i dont even like mushrooms and they were delicious hydro bib black cod shrimp tempura roll spicy tuna roll my least favorite but still appetizing even for me who doesnt like    spicy tuna albacore sashimi some complimentary fish with pop rocks i think sashimi trout  second least fav but still good the sauces are paired really well with each dish
the food as always is tops especially for the adventurous
she never comes back with my coffee
the stewed chicken is falloffthebone and is very well seasoned
wife and i stopped by after a show for a quick bite
my husband and i had thee best breakfast we have ever had
this place is great because its opened really late and always easy to get a table
i had a burger with all the trimmings and it was prepared perfectly
never had an issue with either
like a bean smoothie wtf
there were only 2 tiny pieces of corned beef and the soup was bland
the alaskan king crab leg appetizer served chilled with a little bit of lemon and tabasco was amazing we should have ordered the larger portion
the plus is that we didnt have to wait for a table
sausage and bacon a tad salty but very satisfying
the pork dumpling was definitely the winner
my husband and i try pizza everywhere we go
i mean its called viva las arepas right
ordered the wagyu beef sandwich but it came with a little extra in ita small blonde hair buried in the sandwich
as i sit here writing this i wonder if anyone would ever even touch the salt and pepper much less use them
i didnt get to go to the elite event at mercadito boohoo so this was my virgin visit
the restaurant is a small pizza shop on pearl road attached to the office bar where i have never been before and the parking lot is small and cramped as is the restaurants lobby
out of the two i preferred the heuvos rancheros
epic fail hello yelp
this is the best restaurant in scottsdale
my friend invited me here
the pasta ive had there wasnt horrible but it also wasnt anything i have reordered since
cant wait to go back
des cendriers qui aspirent la fume de cigarettes pour viter denfumer les voisins
two points to steak n shake for good followthru
iced tea for me coffee for husband
if a cook messes up a couple of steaks and that is the worse thing that happens
not somewhere i would come everyday but a nice treat every once in awhile
anyway the food was pretty terrible
nothing to see here
again the view is amazing and the owner was friendly but the salmon was on par with the frozen stuff from the grocery store while the steak was very good received rare instead of medium rare
ricos does brunch
the corn tortillas not flour
my date had asked if we can be seated by the window overlooking the fountains of bellagio
this is the first time i tried this place for lunch
usually excellent service
three small tacos with a side garden salad is just the right portion as well
the building is phenomenal and the staff were kind and helpful
cant wait to go again
plus the service was fantastic friendly and fast
calamari was also lightly deep fried and didnt taste fishy
au riz souffl avec amandes graines de citrouille etc
i had chocolate souffle for desert
also they have bottled domestic beers for only 1 all day every day last time i was in so get down on that why not
this particular location is clean and the staff is so friendly consistently
you can imagine what such a thing does to your appetite and getting a new dish did not change that fact
todays visit was the worst its been and i dont anticipate us returning again
the service was not very good as our plates kept piling up after we ate and were not cleared in a timely manner
it was an interesting dynamic to have bacon inside the waffles
i believe the place stands out for the wafflewiches
very high quality food and outstanding service  the managers would walk around and enjoyed interacting with the employees with smiles and even a hug here and there
food the meal is simple and not much to choose from
i love this place
its not that im that much of a connoisseur i wish its that my expectations have grown to be that high
it was starting to look a little bit like a matchstick house about to catch fire any second now
the food was delicious and the waitresses were very kind
if youre white supremasist a mexican hater kkk confederated arpaio lover and so on this might not be your place
will definitely return sooner than later
i am not basing this review off of the actual barrestaurant as i havent been there enough times to warrant a full review rather i am basing it off of the wonderful party they hosted for us
it started out a tad confusing
i came here with my mom niece and a friend for dinner
the ribs and burnt ends were delicious
everyone in our party loved their meal
the yellowtail was excellent and my favorite
food came out out of order and not complete
we will go back to try the bowling since we have the pogo passes but i dont have high hopes for it anymore
the seasonal vegetable tortas and tacos are also excellent and though i cant personally comment on the dishes containing meat i can say this i had taken my brother and sisterinlaw both foodies and carnivores to gallo blanco during one of their previous visits to phoenix
there are plenty of chicago style pizza places on west side
hummus was just great
vick our server actually had the chef make me an additional portion to take home for naan dipping
i didnt have one but the long island comes in a can which is pretty cool imho
we had a funny waiter who loved to interact and talk with us
well my food is gone my water cup as dry as the sahara and ive resorted now to downloading and playing some iphone game about breaching a beach
anytime i am somewhere warm i actually look for a tommy bahamas restaurant
the manager if that was the manager just chatted with the receptionist staff and did not go around to check with customers
i have great memories of heading to a similar style of restaurant when i was a wee girl
this place is awesome
i guess it really shows that i cant go without soup and noodles for more than a few days
if you are looking for typical uninteresting asian cooking  you wont find it here
i order from them often  i would highly recommend you do as well
food is great in terms of portions
tasted like regular rice with shrimp their pad thai had lots of flavor to the dish
they are always out of something
i did not want to share it with anyone
enjoy guys
we wanted to eat family style and try a few things out
went downtown with my family to celebrate my moms birthday
during our first and likely only visit the best part of the experience was the service
by outback steakhouse harkins theatre mall scottsdale 101 robert called on our way over to make sure we were coming
i reccommend this place to anyone who wants filipino food
good place to grab a beer and an appetizer
now it might be that my taste buds are ultra sensitive right now due to a low sodium diet
so much great flavor and it was so filling
based on the reviews and the atmosphere i was hoping for more then what we got
ramen sora is definitely one of my top three in the city if not my favourite restaurant ever
thus we scheduled dinner after the show because of this
all i can say is holy cow batmani believe in wings again
consider yourself warned and check it out
i ate a few bites because i was starving and we were still an hour and a half away from home but it was so vile that i just left threequarters of it on the plate
we ordered the fried green beansboth the beans and the sauce that come with them were wonderful
food so i tried the little fries and i chose to go with the cajun style fries let me tell you those fries are wonderful
it is on the pricey side but the food was decent
i read the yelp reviews and couldnt resist trying komex for lunch
server was lovely
hoffentlich wird dort nie renoviert
got damn that thing was delicious
but after the appetizer course is when things started to get off course
i would say this place is eh
could not wait for them to try to get it right
humble premises amazing food and great prices
the staff were also friendly and though there were several people in the store i only had to wait a minute before being helped
in this case i think i liked both the beef and the bison equally they were seasoned well
love this place have been eating there since i was a kid
the beef brisket quesadillas were really yummy
just wish they had some discounted specials for locals
i know how it gets i use to work in a restaurant
i came here today for breakfast hoping to get some of their delicious quiche but they were out
i did not think staff was remarkable
the waitress graciously assists you at the table if pay by cash
not spicy or tasteful at all
i will continue to look for quality thai places but thus far thai orchid is near the top of the charts for my section of arizona
the garlic potatoes with mayo werent too greasy but had a weirdly acidic aspect to them
i had the thai monster bowl
my husband had the chicken pesto fettucine i had the chicken and mushroom pasta yum and i cant remember what everyone else had
for those complaining about the service get over it what do you expect from a bunch of old timer greeks working all day in that heat
much better value than a 89 pulled pork sandwich you buy there
took us three orders to get our drinks on the table
you will love this placejust a little to old of crowd for me
seriously ive only been here 5 minutes and have already almost had my water come out of my nose
definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area
if youre in the area and craving greek food i definitely recommend popping in to gyros plus
lucas made some arrangements for us to taste all sauces
i looked around and theres were empty tables everywhere so im not sure why it was slow
if you are in search of local flavor give it a try
the restaurant itself is beautiful with a huge window facing the mall
it might have been what we ordered
one of my favourite brunch spots in the city
the dessert crepe itself was soso  soggy on the bottom from moisture
ive never walked out of a restaurant especially  after waiting but it wasnt worth our time to stay
tried both the asiago and california spinach
we had an excellent experience at china poblano
i landed ona potato
the restroom was clean and freshly scented
we had the pizza cones which were stuffed freshly in front of our eyes but they were much smaller than i had expected
ohand we got a free pie to take home because our guest check was over 30
i was very happy with the food quality and would try it again  just maybe take out from now on here
i popped in here for a quick bite cause whos not a fan of hot dogs
i feel so much better
however the fava on flatbread with guanciale was excellent even though it came out too piping hot
they also have a martini menu which would be fun to try but not for lunch today
i heard their coffee was great and their watermelon juice was amazing
location is perfect and surrounding all other bars and restaurants that are close to campus
the bun was soft and toasted perfectly
maybe my next annual vegas trip
they then explained to me that is how eggs are cooked but they would overcook some for me
usual great service by alex as well
see you there for some italian goodness
make sure you get there before then so you dont have to resort to dennys
what a great find
very friendly came around multiple times to make sure we were doing al right
ive had some overly sweet ddeokbokki sauce and it just completely ruined the dish but not this one
the cold brew refreshing chocolatey
the portions are huge fresh and delicious
why hide it
the spazmatics really made the night a lot better
went here for the first time this morning due to pamelas being jammed
great service and yummy food
i have only ordered delivery and never eaten in the dining room so my review is based on their take out menu
if you do decide to go make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night
so many better choices in town
i thank antonia and renzo for introducing me to this place
im talking chais people get your mind outta the gutter
when we checked out he didnt give us a lid i had to asked for it haha
i was a little shocked because you could tell i barely ate it
when asked if there was  lunch specials we were told not on cinco de mayo
and its not that mcdonalds garbage
one of the best indian restaurants on the west coast
cant wait for winter to start going on friday nights again
we get to yoshinoya and i am automatically thinking or not thinking since i may have been too hungry i will get a large beef gyudon
the fish is average and the view is great
my bestie said the food was delicious
the quesadilla was a greasy mess of goo
its better than their buffet
i actually loathe mustard  id never had bbq sauce that wasnt sweet  thick so mabels unique sauce was a bit of a shock to the system thin liquidy  yellow with a heavy vinegar taste
i decided to try the pumpkin bread with butter rum sauce and cream cheese ice cream
the falafals were fresh crispy on the outside but soft on the inside combine with the sauce greens and shell itt the greatest combination
if you go you must have the stone crabs
try them you wont be disappointed and i swear im not related or employed by them
yes it is a long wait on the weekend but to me its like um duh people go out to breakfast on the weekend
it was a sunny day and i was with great company so there could have been worse things
we went on a friday afternoon before the dinner rush
ive dined in here before and the people working here are nice and youll notice they have repeat customers especially from residents in sun city
the manager paige is awesome
totally coming back here
all in all if youre thinking about eating here go for it
this was not sushi ricethis was your college roommates rice cooker at work and though the maguro and shiro maguro cuts of fish were cut just fine and presumably because of their high order rate kept fresh the failing of that rice pulled the rug right out from under themliterally
its the best greek food that i have tasted in phoenix
theyre possibly the only certain delicious item on the lunch menu
we both agreed the burrito was better all the same ingredients plus refried beans rolled up into a tortilla it was delicious
my one critique of the seltzer drink was that it became flat within 30 minutes
their enchiladas are just perfect
overpriced and simply not good
there was just nothing special about this experience
then we waited good 25 minutes for our last dish risotto
without the deal i dont think this wouldve been something thats within my budget
i got the carnitas pollo and barbacoa tacos
i mostly really like south side with one exception
the salads are pretty badthink about getting another veggie or potato for your side dish
was fun to be in a japanese restaurant that was playing reggae music
oh my goodness
ive tried a lot of ayce sushi in vegas but goyemon still remains the undefeated champion
this is a good bar for women to not get grossly hit on in
i think in my five times there i have really only enjoyed one of my meals enough to recommend to people as a definite yes go there
both were fine but i found that the tapioca lacked sweetness
isnt that a mexican dish
chicken fried steak  i only had a few bites but i liked it
be sure to get your parking ticket validated by bc
in fact i could not identify most of the wierd creatures that were cooked and served up
burritos tacos chimichangas nachos etc
had to try it just for fun
they said they only had raspberry
i wonder if it was sitting under a heat lamp for too long
service the service was excellent
the third item i had was a chicken curry on top of a bed of greens
i came here with a craving for banh xeo
the waiter said okay and left to take the order of another table
i wouldnt mind going back and have another one of this
his knowledge of drinks and his friendly charismatic personality made our trip to vegas a plus
itll all be great
i do think the food is overpriced and i wasnt overly wowed by some of the dishes like i had hoped to have been
bring on huge quantities of scrambled eggs bacon etc wash it down with gallons of strong black coffee and thats a meal made in heaven
lower end pizza
the chicken was horrible and it did not have enough sauce
i love the options provided and all the ways you can vary the meals
after looking over the menu we chose the nonvegetarian platter and chicken vindaloo which was plenty for two to share
although using fresh pasta was commendable overcooking it was not
i guess just like most breakfast place  its not a big place but it does hold a terrace
there may have been 8 small pieces of steak in it
makes no sense but online said ther
when the hostess is there she doesnt really do much of anything
would eat here again
highly recommend this place
a year ago this place was awesome
fairly expensive but well worth it
there were only 50 coins instead of 100 that i paid for
the wings are always perfectly cooked nice and crispy
great place go there
uptown alley is the answer
i got the braised beef short ribs which came with gnocchi and swiss chard i had the cipollini removed due to food allergies
how did it take someone so long to come up with this idea
not because its not delicious to go had it that way the first time and it was great but because you will miss out on their amazing salsa
the atmosphere was very friendly and the waitstaff was super attentive
this was a great place to stop and eat breakfast
the food is good but a bit pricey
i ordered from their lower fat page on the menu the guiltless grill an asada steak with seasonal veggies and a side salad
someone had the pancakes which seemed a good portion but heard it taste pretty basic
the waiting time was a bit too long for a breakfast
one of those guys turned out to be mattie himself
the greens sitting under the quail were delicious
food not nearly as good as last time
wonderfully surprised by the tasty authentic food served here
ok drinks and ok food
theres a big sign above it indicating this
but guess what i have to tell her again
30 for a seafood buffet off the strip
die teller wurden erst mal wieder in die kche gebracht danach zu unserem tisch
first i love the decor and the entire feel of the place
my con is the bread is a little too thick for my liking but delish
it reality should be 45 stars but this is my first time here and i dont want to waste 5stars on only one try if possible
my favorite server is natalie shes always upbeat happy and does a great job
very calming artsy atmosphere
had to keep a watchful eye and continuously give instructions
still having a moment over here
ill still come back
die preise gehoben ehe durch die lokation und die zentrale lage als durch qualitt des essens gerechtfertigt
i have been to a few taco spots in my day from la street tacos off pico whittier east la even found some gems in the bay area but hands down this is definitely one of the best spots i found in vegas if not anywhere
it was okay but i was looking for something more flavorful
the details are hard to find out because their website is not up yet and they dont list any info at the restaurant but apparently this is a local and ecofriendly establishment
not listing sour creamcrema
i went with my brother and my one year old niece and the staff was incredibly attentive and made sure we were taken care of
bread was too thin
i watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a ton of fries
i know that the taco has become very trendy as of late and that a few places in the city are serving up some great tacos but none are as amazing as seven lives
i was excited to try his lobster but i didnt even finish it because it was rubbery
fooddrink 5 i love the duck salad drinks are also creative and healthy
the service was good  three out of four of us asked for alterationssubstitutions  our server  the kitchen were very accommodating which was greatly appreciated
some new options would be nice management appears to be making an effort to be more friendly to customer too which never hurts
she answered my questions
thats the best
great tai food
he responded yeah they increased the prices
absolutely worse food i have ever been served
we had to ask for the manager after we were still waiting half an hour past their 30 minute estimate for our seating
i recently moved to concord and have driven past this place several times
we brought our check to the hostess she asked how was the meal we told her awful she rolled her eyes and ran our credit card
the first time i went i ordered some weird vegetarian specialty roll which i couldnt finish because there was ginger and some other things inside it which i could not stand but i will blame this on poor ordering choice however the second time i went i ordered the right things and was much more satisfied
i was pleased with my first visit to manuels mexican restaurant
the dining room is peaceful and the wait staff are attentive and patient
she always gets the paris texas red yam fries
they stick a table tent with a number on it directly into your pizza hopefully someone washes these
theres other places that are equally good in taste and quality that cost much much less
food that fills your mouth and soul with flavors that you didnt know existed
why have we allowed restaurants to get away with a complete blatant robbery  250 for a drink
addiction americas taco shop pork aka pastor
i ordered the speciality crepe and it was mediocre
i didnt try it until the following day for lunch when i went home i had to ask her where she got the food from because i was quite impressed with the taste
service was overall very friendly and helpful
they made him a new burger and comped us for it but the food over all was still just not good
i have had the pork ribs the chicken the brisket and the beef ribs
eat first before coming here
i love texas roadhouse and go quite frequently
bam extra drink added to my bill
id say average
thats quite unique
makes ordering easy for someone as indecisive as i am
unfortunately we didnt really feel like we ate all that healthy there mostly due to the sweetness of the dishes
skinnyfats is mmm mm good
this is by far the best value summerlicious lunch i have ever had
their pancakes were my favourite so light and fluffy
yummy yummy thai food
the madeleines were okay pretty similar to what i can get at longos
we also had a couple beers
you get your moneys worth
jacks has lived in the shadows of its better known rival  corkys and lennys  for years
after your meal dont forget to wander fremont and gander at all the freaks and inappropriate tourists
a breakfast burro is pretty huge and the one that i got was the size of a breakfast burrito
whatever the reason i was willing to wait
the menu is absolutely massive and it would take forever to try everything but i guarantee theres some serious gems hidden in the three pages of food
as for the food ive yet to complain about any of the food items on the menu
upon walking in i was impressed with the over all  decor and style of the place
the meat was tender and moist and was pulled nicely but still had some nice and crispy chunks
has enough table n chairs too for groups
possibly one of the best restaurants in the world
the only item that didnt go over well was the gazpacho shooters
anyway its worth going just for the beer but not for anything else
nothing fancy about this place but its all about how it taste
booths and tables are both available and there is a large parking lot
good mix and serving sizes  brie comt and blue with ample compote grapes and crackers
i agree with some of the other posts  they seem a bit forced and uncomfortable
the tomato sauce was bland it was topped with mozzarella cheese underneath the cheese the sauce was tomato paste with water255 chicken wings were sliced into half wings as 2 pieces from one
the food might be great for all i know but the service is unbelievably poor
when the waitress came by she asked if we were done with the salad never asking if anything was wrong since it was clearly not eaten
what a sweet old ladie
recommend doing take away and enjoying their great biryani at home
also good that they had a prix fixe menu with drinks included to get us served in decent time
rosatis is a chicagoland staple
she is the definition of excellent customer service
this is a really good ramen place they are very consistent definitely one of my favorite places to eat in toronto
i had even resorted to desperation by begging the swiss chalet operator to let  me receive deliveries from another location and was told no
with recent refurbishment it offers comfy seats to enjoy your drinks and a big screen for those allimportant sports matches
she kept our drinks filled as best as she could since the restaurant was completely packed
warm and welcoming lots of cool are and things to look at
it was hot fresh well seasoned and falloffthebone tender
my favorite part of the experience was the way the waiter grabbed the tablecloth from all sides and simply swooped up all the dirty plates revealing a clean tablecloth underneath ready for the next customers
like to play games
so we literally found menus that were lying around as we couldnt find any wait staff apart from the bar tender
overall its probably 3 stars for the food itself but an extra star for the vibe of the place cool 50s style great oldies music comfortable booths etc the friendly service and the good time that we had
it was my sisters 21st birthday and they did the great job
if you cant appreciate the adventure of visiting a restaurant thats in an old building around the wrong part of town then youre missing out on the some of the most authentic food out there
they were very good about repeating back my order multiple times leading me to believe that they pay attention to detail and want to ge vegan orders right
the pasta was perfectly cooked and they give you a bunch of clams
server and manager were great
we had to walk to bar to locate waitress several times
food is always good and consistent service was good too
omelettes were fantastic
generous portion of clams too
i honestly dont know how people manage to be nice to drunks but i guess were their bread and butter
the 35 dinner menu consisted of an amusebouche  3 courses
we were talked into a skillet cookie to top it off  not something id do every time but well worth it
i practically drank a gallon and our server never even let my glass get less than a quarter of the way full
love the food but the service was not even close to 4 stars server was very humble and nicewhen we actually saw him
when we final got seated it seemed an inconvenience
90 of the table were empty what a joke
overall im glad i checked this place out i will be returning to try the monday burger special 5 for the haverhood burger from 610pm normally 11
the price point is a little high but sometimes its worth the value and lets be honest its just nice to spoil yourself from time to time
dish smelt like smoke and taste watery and burnt
so many good reviews i just had to try it
wir haben uns fr dieses men entschieden allerdings zt
i love their bibimbap
the potato masala is very mild and the chutneys have varying degrees of spicyness
got us everything we needed and explained the menu perfectly
extremely affordable at 2395 per person for dinner
just a disappointment
what is there to say
have a few drinks at the bar and enjoy the ambience but plan to have dinner elsewhere
they were also very oily which wasnt settling with me very well
staff is friendly and will make sure you have a great meal
why only three stars
but a great experience tonight
if you want to feed yourself your wife and all of your brats for 30 go to steak n shake and save us all from disappointment
this is the real deal people
complimentary bread soft crusty warm yummo
decent foodalong the lines of aladdins in flavor but more expensive
an hour later i remember why i had come in the first place
we need something in this area to call our place keep us the good work well be back over and over again
the wife had the prime beef filet topped w the peppercorn sauce
see the restaurants own video on youtube httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmz9ahwcj5mwfeaturemfuinorderlistul  the atmosphere is cordial and conducive to just eating
she openly disapproved of my request to take home our leftover liver pate
we had the artichoke appetizer
this is a poor design
however i dont go to restaurants for the ambiance and decor
this brings back memories of the mouthwatering goodies i encountered growing up in europe at the local konditorei
on my next visit in a few months i will be skipping the strip steak house and going to the buffet at caesars palace 5 yum
the restaurant is a bit small and since it can get busy you will feel a littled cramped
they also have dessert if you are into that
green beans sucked and were cold
this place is a chain known accross the country where the hell is the marketing department from the corporate office in finding out why their location sucks balls and has a rating less than a motel 6
i like this place
it was this action that kept this review from being a one star
vegetarian options are way better here
the bacon was thick but had over 50 fat so that wasnt edible either
moist moist moist
this also makes navigating through the parking lot a complete exercise in stunt driving between cats sitting randomly and suddenly moving to try and get to a soon to vacate pump or just pedestrians playing frogger through the lot
we sat at a high top in the bar area and were approached right away for our drink orders
however it was underwhelming
i never had a good meal here and service is blah
i think it was 8 for 12 inch pizza
however we havent been here in awhile because we were so busy planning our wedding
i actually got to enjoy it on its first saturday at dinner
the pep pep was alright probably a little too basic even though thats what they were going for
sauce was weirdly tangy
when youre feeling extra hungry get the euro fries carne asada fries or the sweet potato kimchi fries
looking forward to the day i can give them a 5 star rating
she was actually there earlier and was waiting on him
the best restaurant experience ive had in las vegas regardless of price point
the cashier stand has everything in clear view you can stand by the side and watch your drinks being made or take a look at the variety of desserts they have on display
once we asked for the sauces they were a fun element
no one showed for a while so i went out to ask if we could get some service while also mentioning the state of our theatre
by far the worst pizza in vegas dont waste your time and money
it is not a traditional indian restaurant it is modern meets indian
update had all you can eat and its a little overwhelming since there are so many specialty rolls to choose from but everything i tried was so delicious this is definitely my new all you can eat sushi
there three of us
i had shu mai bananas foster banana pudding corned beef hash and fried plantain
my daughter had the bacon cheeseburger and i had the brewmaster pizza
this night was particularly cold and windy so inside was perfectly fine with me
so while i was dreaming of crunchy bacon dipped in duck fat what i got was soft duck fat in baconlike strips on top of my burger
for 12 tip i think there are a lot better choices nearby
i loved fat choy
sometimes you just want to eat something delicious in your pajamas and on your couch
so there food is sub par compared to other locations and they always mess up our orders
loved the food
it is also kind of out of the way so you probably wont know its there unless you know where to look beforehand
those little guppies dont know how to handle their liquor yet
the papa a la huancaina potatoes with a cheese sauce appetizer is another simple yet tasty dish  also a great vegetarian choice
everything was very very well cooked
there was barely any sauceit looked like my plate when i heat some spaghetti up at home in the microwave and all the sauce dries upso the whole dish was dry
a little surprising because he normally doesnt comment on things like that so it wasnt just me being crazy picky preggers lady
what i am saying is that you basically get the same thing right next to each other just presented in a different cover
we just had to try it
wonderful food with bright lively interior
i would also add a little more sweetness to fhe filling
so if you are thinking of eating here just know that its good food but you may have to wait longer than expected
i was especially happy with how the poached eggs and korean short rib complimented each other
the bacon date wrapped meatballs are delicious
mmmhot sakeserved best when it is hotso drink up and dont let it cool
they tasted stale and were not crunchy
very affordable and a great service and nice looking atmosphere
thats right  lunas is one of a select small group of places that keep getting better sunflour fiamma and lunas
she got a manager who agreed that there was about 40 ounces in the pitcher and i asked how then would it be more expensive than buy two large sangiras which would have been over 46 ounces
the service was very poor
i would say this is solely a pizza joint which we doubt well return to try
secondly the place is pretty hip
check this place out and get the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes
if anything come to woburn garden for the experience not for the food
i had to ask for their hot sauce twice they gave us two basket of chips for a party or 5 and never asked whether we wanted more i ordered the green chili and the pork was wy overcooked  the sauce was flavorful their taco meat way way too dry and it took about  10 minutes for the server to pick up the check  the bill had tips calculated for 18 and 20 percent
i know there are some places where you get way too much food and i respect the fact that ingos relies more on taste than quantity however with food so tasty i want my belly just a little bit fuller
the reason i say this is because this place is so popular its not easy getting a table not because of the location buts its famouse for its burgers
ok i admit i have a love affair with this place
i had over easy eggs that were over cooked broke  cold
good pizza but
as my eyes rolled in the back of my head i sucked the bones from the pork chops like a gumless baby and cried a little when they were gone then wanted to curl up and go to sleep on my back because by then my stomach was poking out
he treats us so badly because i prayed
a recommended landmark and a worthy place to have a grilled to order burgers dog chicken steak fish or veggie burger
the food at grape street is incredible
the food was delicious as well
smelly like a clogged restroom or back flow from the sewagedrains
pricing and food is great which makes it a great option to other expensive steak houses around
the service was good and i thought the quality of food was a bit better at this location
service wasnt anything great and i got the impression that she was getting towards the end of her shift and wanted to go home
the only restaurant in the casino open 24 hours
fantastic service and food
fireworks at the old port were visible at midnight on the snow covered terrace
the tables are large enough so you could throw your backpacks whole life on it
average airport bar food
but when an offer for a groupon appeared i couldnt resist
great first impression from this chain restaurant
add carrots and couple other things
this was the first time i have ever visited a cheesecake factory and they set the bar for me and my future visits
i remembered the burgers being amazing the first time i tried them
love this location
good food is what im all about and this place hits the nail on the head
definitely a lowstress goto option in the venetian
vegas does this to diners perceptions
i had to prompt her to ask for my phone number for the reward points because she doesnt ask
they open at 10pm for drinks and serve a small food menu usually around 11pm depending on when cowboy ciao closes because they share the kitchen
i havent been home to pittsburgh for a while and i was really excited to get out and explore the food scene
we didnt like that
auf der toilette war es sehr sauber nur war es dort noch klter wie im restaurant also das ging gar nicht und es gab auch nichts zum hnde trocken das gert wo da war ging nicht also kam man mit nassen hnden wieder zurck an den tisch   wir hatten uns alle sehr viel mehr erhofft schade eigentlich
i will choose steak and lobster the next time
so if your a mai tai drinker have one here
burgers are great and im obsessed with the tots
its so amazing being able to order anything off of the menu
seriously do it
ask for waitress aimee  she was friendly and professional
only 10 pieces so if you have a bigger group you are going to have to order more at cost
i ordered a pasta dish that came out a little on the watery side instead of saucy
ranch and honey mustard complimented the spicy hot sauce of the hot wings
it wasnt worth anything
good break from all those ayce places
and for something a bit different the lobster roll is another favorite of mine
would not recommend
especially since i hear they are closing soon
the service i had happen to be on st patricks day
as you can see im a big fan of spicy food so if you are too i highly recommend it
its probably a fine burrito for most torontonians but not for those who have known betterand if you dont you should know better
easy to find great service  the food was delicious
definitely not my place of choice for a buffet experience
our entrees came out and i took two bites of my crab cakes and quickly started to feel ill hubby shared his steak with me which they raved about its genetically mutated  value
i appreciate the quality of the calamari but the beauty was drowned a bit in the heavy chili sauce
my wifey and i ordered the abc burger brie avocado and caramelized onions with sweet potatoes fries
i enjoyed my jambalaya  my husband really loved his shrimp poboy
the lovely manager explains that he had already started the order before i realized my wallet was not in my purse
the vegies were burnt to a crisp i mean burnt
gonna return for another great date
i got an order of burnt ends to take home and the knocked my socks of with the seasoning and smoke  yum
their special fried rice is always a hit as well
the shrimp and lobster bisque that also had gnocchi in it was poured in a bowl that looked like a flying saucer tableside
lorenzo the bar tender who assisted me was great refilled my ice tea gave me a to go cup before leaving and brought my check in a timely fashion
i find that montreal is lacking in the saladhealth restaurant department so if you want a healthy yet satisfying meal mandys is the place to fill that void
when people order alfredo we understand its going to be white
i got the beef kabob with two sides
even though we were pretty full the waiter talked us into ordering the monkey bread for dessert
well love garcias as a great neighborhood restaurant with good food at a reasonable price
dont forget the liver and onions
most that ive had are the correct amount of spicy
stopped in for lunch burrito  enchilada style red
i should have taken this as a sign
the girl at the window didnt seem too friendly  but whatever maybe it was the heat we got our food and waited for the girl to ask of we wanted any sauces since apparently they have a pretty good salsa bar that didnt happen
the tables seating six people and more are nice because the middle of the table has a bar where servers put the chips and dip making them easily accessible for everyone
i love their garden omelet and have eaten their omelet more this past 3 months than i have ever eaten in the past 10 years
this handdrawn noodle place is legit
he was very attentive and answered all of our questions on the menu plus added some of his own recommendations which were all fantastic
fast friendly service
my favorites would be the carpaccio the crab cake lettuce cups the thai chicken flat bread papardelle pasta and holy smores pizza
nothing on em just potatoes
we had a cup of their chicken tortilla soup and it was delicious
all in all good if youre in the area but i wouldnt go far out of my way
a really nice clean place for board game enthusiasts
stuck in an undesirable location thats seen as the cheapest fast food option by far within 20 blocks but on the other i had a friend who worked there and told me all about the terrible working conditions useless managers and the overall mediocre food
this time it was done right and is worth giving a shot
also i noticed an increase in prices of the lunches and it definately was not worth it
the good thing about this place is that its a food truck so you get your hot dog freshly cooked and if hot dogs arent your thing the menu is pretty extensive and covers other mexican fare
personally the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet
we walked in staff was super friendly and engaging
the hash was a little under seasoned but nothing a little salt and pepper cant fix but once all mixed together was a nice hearty good portioned breakfast
i ordered some street tacos al pastor and they were okay
the best fries in the valley in my opinion are those at bitter  twisted
when i first opened the container i was disappointed as it looked like a typical boring takeout rice dish
insisting that its the best thai food in phoenix
just great tacos over all
i do have to say that their chicken paprikash soup is out of this world
we ordered the curry shrimp and paid over 13 for the dish and recieved only 5 shrimp
i have tried pizza salad bread sticks pasta and wings from here on separate occasions and they have all been outstanding
also after the 3rd one you start to crave other booze
when i treat myself i order the strawberry shake
we started off with the fried pickles and bacon wrapped jalepenos
my husband and i came back on this trip specifically to get the french macaroons
3 shrimp donuts
we found a table for 4 people and squeezed 5 the food came quickly considering the sheer amount of people there
will definitely not return nor recommend this place to anyone
i want to start by saying the atmosphere at this place was amazing
what an amazing breakfast concept
i ordered the jinya tonkotsu black with thick noodles
ive never had this issue at any other enp
it didnt make sense
if you like a big sandwich they have the best
then going to the bar myself to order
here is what i loved about gbs food  their drinks are very fresh they take a little while because they are made with fresh fruitsjuices but they are worth the wait
my one complaint was the mango lassi  it was horrible
the pulled pork was delicious and i was able to get extra salsa guacamole and sour cream in little cups on the side meaning that my main entree wasnt completely slathered in distracting toppings
did you guys forget to pay the gas fired spit grill bill
i cant understand why so many good reviews
everything we have ordered there measures up quite well especially the tiramisu which is by far the best ever
food was amazing
if you are open minded and to attached not to glitter and gold this is a place for fun
came out to perfection  and very quickly
the whole experience was a joke
im pretty sure i used all of it because thats how i live my life all in
i think this is the perfect hangover spot
considering the decor location and very helpful staff the right chef could really set this place apart
i usually dont eat the rice but theirs was good
meal with the spicy baby octopus and its exactly that
for family of 4 we had professionally made burgers at professional prices
the chili resembles something that you can buy in a pet aisle but it makes up for its awful looks in its personality like that one girl in college that always wondered why you never wanted to hang out in public with her
then after that the entrees came after sitting there for about an hour and 15 minutes and the place wasnt even busy
there were no snacks and the kitchen was closed
as i said food was delicious and we finished within 1520 minutes
beer was exceptional so i wasnt unhappy overall
as we left it got a lot busier and tables 4 inside and a few more outside started filling up
we also offered a little appetizer to munch on and some dessert at the end of the meal
a good start
the tempura vegetables were absoultely delicious  grade a quality
not terrible just cheap
paul took special care of us right at the sushi bar even from the upcoming unreleased menu and maggie was on top of everything
we sat at the bar which is kind of smoky not that i was bothered
no joke  i would drive 4 hours for this dish alone
the short ribs and buffalo burger were amazing
the danny special sushi roll was good but a bit greasy
i was also directed to the condiment station
am super glad we found this place as they deliver as well as offer dine in  nice to have options besides pizza
this was my first time at an unos in about ten years
but just an hour or less later my stomach started cramping up
the tips among cooks servers food runners etc are pooled
on the plus side the gal at the counter that made my pizzas was very nice but its a shame i dont see this kind of business surviving
he even told the waitress to give them a discount
the saltiness was exacerbated by the cheese and the red sauce
the seasonal veg was also really nicely cooked  shredded cabbage and carrots neither covered in butter or dried out  just right
the dish had so much tastes
trust me you will not find a better place
for lunch items i tried the mashed potatoes which were presented nice and i think they puree it
it was definitely weird ordering food in english because im so used to ordering in korean at korean restaurants in la and no im not a fob born in the us and just bilingual
this is my favorite next door sushi place since coming to chandler
i came here thinking it was all you can eat which is wasnt so it just added to the disappointment
perfect lighting and a nice air flow threw front and back entrance
you will regret it as every tastes terrible
i had the lamb gyro on a pita and it was pretty good
that had incredible flavor   frozen vinaigrette red mullet chanterelles and natural jus foiegras bitter infusion artichoke and black truffle souptoasted mushroom brioche and black truffle butter guy savoys signature dish american prime beef tenderloin oxtail pommes boulangre sooo sweet and tender and baby heirloom carrots and fine cheeses  quince and apple chocolate fondant crunchy praline and chicory cream
very cool place
seafood sampler was outstanding
we werent greeted and eventually just decided to sit ourselves
i will never be back
grilled asparagus theses were just ok seaweed salad always good because you cant screw it up
now this is where the experience falls apart for mefor me
the ambience the food the people
having been to the plaza midwood location numerous times we are excited they opened closer to where we live
inside its small and a bit squeezed
they have an ordering window through the bar so you can get the best of both worlds
the size large is super large though
the meats are dry and overdone
our office will look for nonfastfood chinese somewhere else
i would say its even worth the drive if you live further out
our server was extremely friendly and our noodle soup was delicious
finally the boss came out and told him what everyone ordered and how the food was distributed
im actually rooting for you
excellent food at a fair price with great atmosphere
everyone was quite helpful and friendly
i should have explored the wall of sauces 24 i counted a little more carefully  the sammy was a bit dry
this place is so close to my house so its convenient quick cheap and relatively healthy providing me with a serving of black and pinto beans fresh vegetables in a corn whole wheat wrap
the fish was tender and flakey and it had guacamole and a chipotle sauce on top
folks there are very helpful and know their stuff
the ingredients are natural  the food is truly authentic
mama rosa opened the first restaurant in the 60s and it was very small with only four tables
a friend has done this many times and there have been no problems just many accolades to the staff and management
fyi i was here back in june 2k10
then as im eating my husband told me how there was a family of 6 that came in after him and they got their food to go before him
i have to say that were going to be here alottttttttt
but otherwise it was good
i can appreciate the idea
but this monday we decided to come for happy hour their house craft beer is actually very good and 3 for a pint what a deal
the staff working there is what really sets them to the lowest you can be
this place was horrible their service was terrible and the food was ok no napkins were given when the food was served and i had to ask for a refill
der aussenbereich ist mit verschiedenen grossen pflanzkbeln ausgestattet
the food and service will be much better
two of my favorite beers combined together
this i learned the hard way
ive been to sansotei for three times
we usually sit at the bar because that way you arent forgotten but that is at most diners
no i am not kidding
salad was good
reminded me of home back in so cal
everything ive sampled so far from the sichuan menu is absolutely delicious
it is kinda hidden since it is located in a small mall called richlane mall
oh and a word about buns they are placeholders imho so i dont like them to overpower the burger
aside from happy hour ive had very mixed experiences with the food there
not a shred of pretense
i just dont get this place
everything was about 9
i noticed this with other groups as well
we would have jaleo is just one of those places you feel like more of an inconvenience to the staff
i tried a variety of items most were xlnt some i didnt care for for some reason most of the sea food was bland  however there are shining starsthe broccoli beef contained real beef non of that mystery meat stuff the short ribs were just xlnt same for the wings most of the chicken dishes were good too
she told me her favorite was a couple of noodle dishes and the black bean sauce
mein freund hat den lasagnepie und auch den haggispie probiert und kann auch diese beiden empfehlen
i love how the menu is fresh and healthy
two people for lunch and we shared the parrillada for two with shrimp
we ordered our drinks or at least attempted to
by the way that in and of itself is completely rude fortunately for her the tips were already calculated in the bill
there was a miserable wretched lady next to us wearing sunglasses inside throughout her entire lunch and she complained about everything
this might be the fact that we are in the south and there isnt a large vietnamese population in nc
i mention this because one of my most common culprits of a ruined day is fighting over parking
the decor is pretty too and love the ipad ordering system
when i said dont you prepare the actual food
fr die momentan wrmere jahreszeit bieten sich verschiedene salate an
i couldnt eat any of it
to top it all they turn up the music louder every hour or so and the servers do some kind of a performance
you should golike now
worth the wait
wont be back anytime soon rather spend my  on food that someone cared about cooking
what she did do was just put a slight amount of frothed milk on top which only had a subtle effect if any
even the pot stickers were tasty thai people rarely eat this but it was good ambiance of a fast food restaurant and small
sehr grossrumig drinnen und auch draussen hat man gengend platz zum sitzen um etwas zu essen und ein bierchen zu trinken
bought dinner for four people lo mein noodles chicken egg foo young chicken fried rice and general tsos chicken and it was less than 30 bucks
the owner is very very rude to his customers
overall it was a really swell experience and looking at the photo of the meal made me drool a little bit just now
chinato should be very proud to have her as an employee
it deserves the business every bit
brown paper packages filled up with meats these are a few of my favorite eats goat curry jerk chicken rice beans plantains great value thick accents no ambiance
bitte koch wechseln bedienungen austauschen und auch den bier trinkenden chef hinterm tresen auswechseln dann ist das restaurant voll
the service was very good
there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken
im far from vegan but coming here i dont mind acting like i am for the day
for those who want to gamble or watch a few sports games that is an option at ebc
this is a cool little place down in a basement well actually its a garden level spot in market square
i was pleased with my meal
all in all the food tastes absolutely fine for what it is supposed to begeneric takeout style overly americanized chinese food
ive stayed here a few times and always had a great experience so its the place i always recommend to friends visiting edinburgh
and thats sad because i prefer local spots to a large chain pizza place any day of the week
i ordered the chicken parm and it was the best i ever had
i had the spinach and almond enchilada and chile relleno it was good
2 having said that this place does well with small groups during the lunch time hours
will definitely go back
will definitely be back to try another sandwich
two people can easily share a meal and have leftovers
i imagine its street parking only
ordered a half dozen shuckers choice and they shuck them right in front pack it on ice and mignionette and other condiments are in bottles on the counter
i hear the pancakes are also very good and the bacon was thick and chewy
i had to ask about it later and when we got it it was very thin and very stale
less than youd spend on a manufactured and plastic tasting meal at applebees and the like
i love this place
there are lots of other things on the menubut were sold on the chicken
i was disappointed with the food and the service
this second time we went we were there for brunch there was only 5 tables at the restaurant and it took forever for our food to come
the only reason i wouldnt go back would be for a lack of groupon
the gelato was as delicious as it looked and is a musttry for gelato fans
nevertheless the service was very prompt even for a lunchtime
my boyfriend is partial to the dennis sandwich  a perfect blend of slightly spicy with fresh cilantro  and my favorite is the chicken pho
thanks pinches for a wonderful experience
i want to try pretty much everything on the menu
they even went so far as to say that if we did choose to sit even in the bar area read nonhibachi our friend could join us but she would be not be able to order from the menu
everything is fresh high quality and exploding with flavour
5 paying customersapparently things are going so well they dont need our business
the traditional peruvian plate called arroz chaufa  was a tomatal rip off
he said he was sorry yet our experience was destroyed
boy were glad we had that empanada because smell of that food was incredibly good
overall some things worked
the fun part is the hipster staff and chefs
if youre not a fan i am sorry
hopefully the food is not equally sad
however i like to look at boston pizza restaurants as a sports bar
im not vegan and it still taste normal to me
the food however came out quickly as soon as we ordered
after 15 minutes i decided to leave
for a 6 dollar meal it was great and has great portions
this place is really popular while we were waiting for a table more people came in and after paid our meals and left there was still a crowd of people waiting
this is definitely a must visit for delicious comfort food and an awesome atmosphere
im a huge fan of postino so i wasnt really sure what to expect
after our meal one of the owners of the restaurant came by to talk to us he was a very nice person and you can tell hes passionate about his business
we sat down and waited for water or bread or a hello but it didnt come until 30 minutes later
they too enjoyed the look and taste of their dishes
the lobster tail was hot well seasoned and presented nicely atop the tail shell
our group ordered 3 beers 4 waters 2 appetizers and a salad the drinks came out in 30 minutes while the food took over and hour
the louisiana chicken pasta is also always a perfect choice
i keep going back to work my way through the menu and have not had a bad dish yet
i always get the 7 carne asada plate and the food is amazingly and consistently delicious
for my main i had the striped bass
best gluten free pizza ive ever had
both in my salmon and the caesar salad
got the carne asada street tacos and they are quite possibly the best tacos i have ever had
after that the service was great
the server must have been new because the service was substandard
after a bad experience and leaving another restaurant on church street we decided to come here and it was a nice sunday supper that was just like mom would make it
wed return for certain
my girl got the lilys mixed salad and she was impressed as well
some of our favorites were the pork and shrimp shumai shrimp dumpling sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves ang roti canai
the fish was cooked excellently and the flavors of everything went great together
we tried the smoked wings and this was a bit of an off day i suspect because they were pretty dry
sad jessica ruined what was to be a nice relaxing anniversary dinner
what else could you ask for
the waiters wear these retro white tux jackets
its official we love rm seafood
then found a hair in my food
had i wanted to eat dinner at a dive bar i would have done so and certainly would have paid a lot less
the italian sausage is good and not the pellet stuff you get in other pizza joints
last little while the quality has slipped
having this marketplace to walk to is priceless
when a line does build up the team of employees works together to get the customers taken care of
service was barely given had to almost beg for refill on tea food lacked flavor the shrimp were tough pricey for the portion salad was good
the ambience and decor is very warm and homestyle with a classic cafe interior
in actuality no follow up was offered
they give you free bread
sandwich is dressed with sprouts bacon and avocado
typically they are 36 each but with the buy one get one free deal how could you just have one
i need to come back and try another entree
ordered an aloo gobi cauliflower and potato roti and it tasted like chef boyardee sauce with heat
he was just as rude as the other people and really didnt care if we came back or not
little bit on the pricey side but if you appreciate locally grown food with flavor this is it
got a little harsh but i let the waitress know and she fixed it right then and there
the food is great but this lapse in service is unfortunate
while we were discussing possibly leaving for somewhere else the gentleman behind the counter started walking us through the ordering process by asking us things like sweet or savory
im a repeat customer and i  recommend you try it
the service is excellent  always greeted with a smile upon entering
when we arrived the hostess took a little while tom come and greet us but it didnt bother us since we had the chance to snap a few pics and she even offered to take one for us
thank you for being so fast  helping me get my boba tea
try ml for a special occasion or a dressy night out
always someone there to give speedy refills
there is also a chicken strip place right next door my little cutie pie wanted
something magical about the sauce they use and the crust is very original
the cook kept using profanity along with the waitressescashiers there
ordered prime rib with soup as sides mine was the clam chowder she got the french onion
yes i am one of those who gladly will embrace christmas preparations as early as october midnovember is definitely leaving it late for me as i stood there chatting away with my 105 lime and soda not the most expensive ive had but not the cheapest a glorious aroma filled my nostrils and past my eyes floated a plate bearing beautiful golden and crispylooking battered fish
the old fashioned is truly a treat
the earthiness and texture of fried mushrooms was the main accompaniment but the real star was the rich moist fish
update 121015 fried mushroom app is decent fried mozzarella stick app is very average and namethatchicken burger might not even be as good as some of mcdonalds premium chicken sandwiches
great ambiance and quite classy
we started with a few apps calamari octupus crab cakes tuna tartare carpaccio and the beat salad
he could use some brushing up on phone etiquette but in person service was good
for opening day they were also giving away free dessert
if this is the location inside the walmart i would rather crawl across broken glass and then dive into a pool of rubbing alcohol than eat at this location again
the service was attentive and excellent
we started leaving a few people at a time and consolidating our tables and the servers were very understanding of that overall 810 additional notes you definitely need to come here
i just need to come next time with at least one less person
3995 per person for food we had to cook ourselves
will definitely attend again
ive tried everything from their burger to the hummus to their sushi to the pot pie gnocchi
the icing had a weird texture and an oily taste
unser fazit fr mal schnell vor dem kino ist das restaurant ausgezeichnet fr mehr aber auch nicht
i loved it
they also had bafun uni pasta which i should have gotten since i believe that was just uni and not tomato cream
there is hot seafood cold seafood egg tapas pork beef bread tapas vegetarian tapas multiple paellas family sized pigs on a platter this is truly a restaurant where the biggest issue is deciding but having small plates makes this so much easier to do
i see some other reviews referencing the wait timeit took about 15 minutes for my togo order and everything was made completely fresh
like the pho it was nothing to rave about
i love their try for 2 combo where you chose 23 of salad soup and sandwich
checked in again she told me i was next to be seated then seated 3 more tables
service we sat at the bar which isnt huge i think there were between 1215 stools and the  server was very friendly very helpful and very nice
the hashbrowns taste average
we have been to the supper club twice
all in all i wouldnt hightail it back to try out their other rolls unless it was just convenient because i was seeing a movie
say no more
i carried back a plate with various sushi rolls noodles shrimp sliders and even a cute metal basket full of tater tots yes a bloody basket of tater tots
its worth the hunting that youll need to do in order to find this place
i had chili chicken plenty of times before and i know the difference between freshly cooked food and old left over food very well
plus it makes you feel more like your steak eating companions to have this retarded big portion on your plate
the light sauce is perfect the cheese is very fresh and very tasty
several things that i liked about this buffet
i didnt say anything cause he was with his chick and i had to fart
finally a great place to get excellent quality baked goods as well as super service
im a simple guy
did i mention their menu is huge
i informed our server it was strictly for yelp adding purposes and that i wasnt going to order anything else
the sushi was pretty good and there was an okay amount of variety
quality service is just as important
i wish i could say they are great like everyone claimed but they are not
still i felt that the accompanying sauce was a bit too strong for meat of this quality
the salads are passable the samosa and vegetable pakoras appetizers tasted dryold but the curries they offer are well done
i dont know if thc is just growing their business too fast to keep that special charm they had or what but it just wasnt the same
5 chicken wings 8  this was nothing special but pretty crispy
great dish during the winter in toronto
no seasoning on the steaks as far as i could tell
the beans were good but the gumbo was utter crap
i appreciated the theme and story of the restaurant as well as the comfortable environment
the dance party at the pool on saturday was a little too daytona beach for my taste but sundays more laidback island vibe was more my speed
definitely a five star experience
it is a wonderful restaurant even if you dont have a special occasion
the food is soso come for the drinks and the chilling
i have to agree with the served with an attitude service comment in the reviews
the sushi menus on the tables are filthy
i always recommend this place to everyone i know
maybe im biasedive been cooking for just under two decades and am mexican american
yelp 2016 100 challenge 64100
its a nice idea but this restaurant is putting on a facade and youre better off not going
we have tried dumplings all over us and this was on par with chicagophilly dumpling places
seriously we were swatting them away from our food
food and drink are sooo cheap here we ate 3 burgers with fries had 3 pbrs and 2 redbullvodkas and the total came out to 2468
i have tried both locations and neither disappoint
the alfredo sauce was real bland chicken parmesan too thin and mainly breading
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because they dont serve alcohol yet
better portions than panda
outside of the salmon which was outstanding there wasnt one of the entrees that i wanted to have more of
i know the place gets pretty packed when there are games on
the food is always hot and very tasty
none of these things should have been going on during business hours
it definitely did not disappoint
and while it was good it wasnt great
this place was good but didnt satisfy my ramen craving
he made sure that everything was going well and that we were happy with our food
it was easy in and easy out but the choices seemes somewhat limited
the coffees were tasty and the ricotta cake was just wonderful
the tortillas were not the usual prefolded taco bell things
staff is friendly and nice with the owner acting as the host
youll be so glad you did
decor is modern and the place is clean
while filling and a decent portion we ate the whole thing
the meatball sub sandwiche will feed a family of 4 with no problem
but not four peaks
they said not to do it any other way
great value for money and pizza tasted amazing
this used to be our favorite pizza place in madison
i hate to shit on a local business but i work hard for my money at work work that i do with a smile on my face only to pay to be treated like a nuisance on my day off
first of all let me say i really like the feel of this place
i learned never trust anything from philly in one sip
the quality of the food is vastly better than just about any fast food place out there and is cheaper on average
the service was great everyone was so friendly and attentive
i might even leave a tip in the plastic container by the register
so much on the menu i wish i could have tried more
you wont be disappointed and be entirely pleased
we hadnt made reservations for our sunday night dinner so we called that afternoon to see if they could squeeze a group of 8 of us in
started out shaky
brick is a really cool concept in the strugglingtosurvive arizona center
if i was his manager i would instruct him to say sir for your safety please no jumping into the pool
i feel bad about doing this most of my reviews are 5 stars but we ordered several viands from djs  all of them were grease factories with a bit of food in them
i do wish they had some food specials but the drink specials beat out all other happy hours in downtown
i have no problem paying 435 for a tasting menu but it better be excellent in concept and execution with service and tools to match
the blue cheese dressing was a work of art
and their havana dream pieoooooo mmmmgggggg it was a dreamsimilar to tres leche cake it was smooth and creamy and the perfect amount of sweet
the cilantro  the lime
staff is always very friendly and they give delicious chips to start off with
service is great they treat you like kings there
i then asked if we stayed after 400pm would they honor the happy hour rates for us
they have delicious heath bar and caramel gelatoplus their waffle cones are darn tasty
people are right
this place has great potential  i am going lightly and regarding it has opening weekend pains however at least 4 front of the house employees working and only 4 people in there my friend and i included in the 4 i expected clearer direction
so anyway there i was making a daring move to go to a place id never been for my birthday daring to my friends anyway and it was one of the best experiences ive ever had
every dish had truffle in it and was well done
please tell the kitchen manager hes doin a great job
we all four order cocktails and he stops back after 10 min to apologize that the bar is backed up and sorry for the wait
after a couple of pitchers of sapporo and a ton of dirty plates we finally hit our limit
ich habe bei meinen bisher fnf oder sechs besuchen immer vor der tr parken knnen
we went on a wednesday night and the live music was good
the staff was super nice and patient they were constantly smiling
i tried a baja fish and short rib taco  very little going on here and looked like they were prepared by someone who did not care
my server counter service only was very difficult to understand nice enough
it is so great to see some new dining options come to the mononabroadway area
the combination of the french bread perfectly cooked corned beef and accompanying sauce was very satisfying
we ordered the wing sampler with three flavors and wild fries
definitely will be back to try the bun and rice dishes
someone finally told me it wasnt pronounced mah jer lees like i had thought its pronounced mar lees
ive grown attached to it
since we got there early it wasnt crowded and my wife and i were able to chat with the bartender
5 more visits and i am eligible for my free medium poke bowl
it tasted like ammonia
our server edith and the rest of the staff were difference makers
he said both were ok nothing amazing
they are also known for their hai nan chicken rice
we had to wait about a half hour for a table but the hostess and everyone were very nice
the fillings spinach tomato broccoli etc
there was so much food that it took me two meals to finish it all
lol i had thought my last visit was a visit to hell because of the cashier but upon revisiting ive come to realize it is the management
the correct response is good luck
the food here is unbelievably amazing
was in the area so i decided to stop by and try this new place
jerks charged gratuity on my card even though i gave cash tip and wrote zero on receipt
service was good
mind you i have a tory burch leather bag and the leather part was on the glass
i was overcharged 80 for 3 beers and 2 well drinks
we started by ordering a bottle of white bordeaux and oysters
the management must not care because the place looked horrible i saw drips going down the sides of the booths from people washing em down but not drying it
with your aunt and mom in the kitchen peeling potatoes for potato salad with smiles and laughter
the warm glow coming from the windows
went here to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary
we shared the poutine appetizer which was overwhelmingly gluttonous but wonderfully executed and tasty
der kartoffelsalat war eine einzige pampe
glad we went but next time im in vegas not sure i wouldnt head back without trying another similar restaurant first
we didnt have one and were told it was a 45 min wait
everyone had a variety of the items that were on the menu
while the tv thing was cool and the sushi presentation was quite nice it was probably some of the worst sushi ive ever eaten
takes a bit of time but worth the wait
unfortunately they dont have tonkatsu ramen and looks like nowhere in pittsburgh does yet sigh but they had some other good choices to satisfy the craving
i ordered the grilled chicken with pink peppercorn cream sauce and it came with veggies and potatoes
i had the prime rib which  i was reluctant to order but it was cooked perfectly
came here tonight after being disappointed from congee queen in toronto
yonakas decor is pretty hip and the food is japanesewestern fusion
pros  really tasty food like really tasty  the chips  salsa come with 3 different salsas each better than the last
i dont know why everyone hates in this place
the slices were so thick and loaded that i was full after just one
i got the broccoli and beef this dish had quality in it
we had the 7 course menu with wine pairings which was great value and delicious
to top it off i felt rushed when she was taking our order
aint nobody got time or money for that
i needed something and your sandwich and pecan bar helped me remember that with every hardship you have to deal witheventually comes ease illumination and experience
the 4 stars is for the excellent service i received
the best part of the meal at dragon pearl i think is the dessert
if you ever get there i recommend you give it a try
we had the entire restaurant to ourselves
it was a friday night so it was very busy and we were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait for a table so we decided to just sit at the bar
we ordered our food and portions where generous
she pointed out that it was a 4oz shot that she pours the only kind they do
i ordered the warm goat cheese
goodby burgers and barf
the craft beer was excellent as well
reviews and seeing it made me want to check it out
ne halbe stunde hat es gedauert bis ein kellner unsere bestellung aufgenommen hat bis dahin hatten wir nichtmal getrnke
let me begin by saying that i feel that i am bbq snob
what i really liked was the extra seasoning they offer on the table which includes seaweed spice spicy seasoning curry black pepper and lemon seasoning
thank you very much torontoim getting fat on this trip
the salads are amazing and so are the gyro sandwiches
the mussels were meh
these will be all over the country in no time
d present your paying customers with food in small amounts so that your paying customer has to keep requesting that more food is brought out for all of the guests
from the minute we walked in we were immediately hit with a very strong smell of spices
she went over to the next table and they complained about something and we heard her apologizing
on mondays they even give you a free sangria with your entree which is a very nice touch
at first i wasnt too crazy about it but soon acquired a taste for it
thus slices picked up while walking by it shall be
excellent pour un brunch
we both tried the seasonal  marzan
we arrived earlier and noticed the restaurant next door was packed
i was a little apprehensive when we first walked it the place looked too fancy to be next to a movie theater
where to start
we had a great experience and will definitely return
skimpin on the product and bad customer service is why i am done here
i still love their baked potato wow it is amazing
get some get some today
we were watching the chefs and prep in the kitchen and they were tediously measuring out everything to the ounce
weve been here several times and their pizza never disappoints the guys who work inside have always been good and friendly and the value you get for your money is well worth giving this place a try slices are pretty huge
its not a library and thats a great thing
still learning the fare and cultivating my pallet
we took the servers suggestion
we ordered and they gave our pizza to another house
was visiting a brew house that is next door and wasnt feeling the food truck offereings
wonderful family atmosphere with young boys talking loudly about their last game and multiple generations listening to every syllable
with 2 orders of california rolls as well 8 pieces per ordernot bad
not terrible but not attentive enough and certainly not as good as what wed experienced here in the past
next the ambiance
stop reading this and go now
if youre interested just ask the staff theyre extremely helpful and nice
if you were thinking about stopping in just skip it its not the good food it once was and the management sucks
ein schnppschen gibt auch immer hinterher
a styrofoam plate with loosely covered foil wrap and a styrofoam box for a wet burrito is unacceptable for food delivery or carry out
for my bunsik crawl i stuck with the ubiquitous and iconic combination of dukbokki and kimbap
will not be going back there again
sandwich hummus  veggie yes this is what its called
the pan fried fish is good as well  very flavourful with a healthy side of veggies
i adore this place the staff is wonderful and the food is amazing
ok no big deal mistakes happenthen we ordered 3 tacos each
the jalapeno slaw wasnt super jalapenoy which is good
it is my daughters and my go to place

unfortunately and sadly this will be my last experience at what was once a great place
this is the part that was surprising
i was happy to see all the drink selections again but i was also pleasantly surprised to find the food much better here than at the other location
bartenders are efficient and polite
our server promised the salad will arrive before the entree but it did  not
i had the short rib taco  only 1 less than a palm of your hand 1050
food the food was amazing
i enjoyed their hot and sour soup their salad and their spring roll but the food didnt really jump out to me
5 drinks at happy hour include the aptly named no
wish i could give it five stars
i grew up in michigan and one of my favorite mongolian stir fry places anywhere was within driving distance
the salad was on point
this place has a great atmosphere and amazing food
having only one cook running the entire kitchen by himself is probably what contributed to this
we stopped by here since it was on the way home and ordered a pizza to go
we had no wait
she said  the restaurant is located in a neighborhood where many houses have been converted into businesses
they told me that its packed on dimsum days
kinda wish i wouldve ordered the full order but i digress
i thought this would be a great addition to the sandwich
whether or not they claim to be homemade i cant remember but they certainly didnt look it
dont worry about making a mess the crumbs are going to fall all over the table no matter what you do
overall the flavors did not come together with the aioli and it just did not taste good
it wasnt extraordinary but i was not disappointed
the 1st amusee bouche is a little squirt of potato salad on a spoon with some fresh dill and some sort of foam
this place is fairly small and most of the employees seemed to be family
ive had churros twice so id give it 1 star
a little disappointed with my cold tacos i love a warm meal for dinner and was expecting a caliente service
and its expensive for what you get
hiding behind that taco was one tiny ass what they call a burrito filled with dried carnitas
you can order males or females
creme brle is amazing
not a fan of the special sauce but it was on the side
and the waitress was actually czech which was cool
the honey chicken and moo goo gai pan the the 1300 a plate price just isnt worth it
for around 23 we got 1 crpe 2 panini comes with chips and 2 sodas
this time did not disappoint
my brother had issue with his room and they found another one for him right away
this is a good chipotle considering one i went to previously never had their rice cooked all the way and had a bunch of cheese in the guac vegan here
ive passed by fleur so many times not because its to be overlooked but because ive eaten at kellers sf location and cant imagine what more i could expect
its the little things
i couldnt be happier with the meal
my husband had the teriyaki steak special with grilled pineapple and fries and i had a simple chicken caesar salad they put avocado in theirs yummy
terrible staff and crappy food
our table was also slanted and only stayed straight if i leaned on it
the restaurant itself wasnt crowded
best horchatta ive found around here
the food was great service was great and we look forward to returning of course
oh yeah the food itself was nothing to write home about
it attracts all types of people in the southend area
the grits were an absolute mess
my friend and i both felt pretty embarrassed even though we called ahead to check that this was ok the waitress brought us our teas but wouldnt take an order for any bites from us and didnt tend to us any further
i had the tapsilog
i loved the wolf in the basement pic attached and the play on the northern lights on the celing
my new favorite
the food was okay nothing special
this was like 3pm in the afternoon
i ordered a water to start and told the bartender i already know what id like the salad nicoise please
the shredded lamb is always my favourite there slowly cooked in pastry amazing
i decided a burger sounded good so i headed in
this place is so packed  and there is no empty tables anywhere
usually can get a good deal if you have gambled a little in the casino first
i would never recommend
the chicken and waffles were a little weak  the fried chicken had an overly thick crust it came with a sweet gravy instead of gravy and syrup separately that tasted a little off
she said the texture of the mushroom wasnt her fave
service is awesome  from a couple of the more seasoned wait staff but have had a couple of experiences that were really bad
amazingly enough i actually loved the az hotdog
slather it with some butter and youre in heaven
tons of bacon awesome
the parlor has so much more to offer than just pizza
the service was also great and all the waiters are smiling and very friendly
tamarind gives in porcelain dish and by the time it comes to table  the curry becomes cold
for the lack of bread with the entree and the fact that there wasnt too much chicken in my meal i cant say that i thought it was that great of a value
needless to say i prefer to just get takeout or delivery
things were plated better than they were prepared
miyagisan burger is bomb af
food was well prepared and served hot
everything from the filet wrapped asparagus to the shima roll was fantastic
security made us wait 45 minutes before speaking with the manager anthony delgado who was condescending and put all the blame on us
nevertheless the food was terrible i was the only one not to receive my food with the others and i had to pester the servers for my dish then the sauces that should come with it
i absolutely love this place
no burger in town is worth over 8 no burger
i could not believe how stingy the portion sizes were especially since i had ordered the same thing the day before at native new yorker and was stuffed to the gills and so delighted with the variety of lettuce and veggies along with the chicken
35 stars outstanding shrimp chop suey     from dining in the sundry of chinese restaurants in southern nevada i noticed that some chinese restaurants shine in certain areas
the grilled beef salad grilled beef with red onion tomato and cilantro seasoned with lime juice and thai chili 795 was an easy choice as this is one of the husbands favorite thai dishes
date square was very good
kobe ribeye steak was tough everything else was just ok  only good thing  was the lamb
the place is small but i was still able to get a last min table at 830 for the same day
we have been few a couple of times and love the energy here
veggies looked ok wasnt really any taste to the bowl unless you drenched it in teriyaki and soy sauce
dont bother with the prawns they werent very tasty
ordered the soup and only after 15 minutes after finishing the bread it arrived
try the whos your daddy  its probably my favorite thing about this restaurant
this place is a hidden gem in the cosmopolitan for the ones who want to spend less on food
as my wife and i were talking about it we came to the conclusion that maybe it just isnt cooked as well done as it is at other sushi bars
egg rolls were kinda good so were the wontons
really anyone who wants more gambling money can save on the food expense by going here
not too bad because they were filled
i thought that i was looking at a place with a  huge menu and a great atmosphere
crust taste like a saltine cracker sauce is just as flavorless
i had an absolutely wonderful time at coup des tartes i would like to thank the chef and owner
what a fantastic outing
talk about going above and beyond
today i stopped by to order the same dish i love only to be smacked in the taste buds with a new much spicier less tasty version
i mean it was all good but the pork stood out even amongst the strong flavors of the sharp cheddar salsa and onions
raku the savory side swept me off my feet two years ago
service was great
their sides are awesome too especially if your a fan of macaroni and cheese
i wanted to go here for my birthday for the longest time
taco itself was ground meat refried bean lettuce and cheese
and white corn
if they had seperated our orders it would have meant a little more work for the waitress up front but no terrible experience at the end
the staff here is friendly and attentive when they werent busy
i have found cheaper alternative options in the area where i feel the food is comparable
restaurant is cute and quaint seating is limited so get there by 10am on the weekends
i will admit thats sometimes the sides arent consistent but ive had more good days than bad
can i do negative stars
pancakes werent bad but like i said earlier nothing special
the waitress refused to let us sit in that table because she said that it was reserved exclusively for parties of six
the flavors are goodthe lobster was a little over done as youd expect from pre cooked meat that is heated back up
usually priced just a hair under typical retail prices
the homemade guacamole was good but the tortillas tasted like plastic
we ordered the nachos with chili to split between the four of us
we had to to wait a while for the food which is no big deal on a second day open totally forgiveable
but then it also came with some ribs
sure the view isnt killer here but its not that bad if you get the city view tower rooms
the corn soup with hominy corn shredded pork kidney beans and onions is low cooked
after that miss we skipped on dessert
i hope they expand to a larger location and bring all the same flavor with them
the food was as good as the photos i kept seeing on my instagram feed
hands down it is the best byob in pittsburgh
second the pizza was ice cold when i called back the wanted to give a discount on my next pizza or re heat it we already waited over an hourand last we ordered a ham and pineapple calzone and they forgot to put the ham i will never order pizza here again im not even going to rate the place they dont deserve it
the food is good the entire staff is friendly and the machines are loose cause they get a lot of play
prior to writing this i sent an email to them via their website that was more than 2 weeks ago and havent heard a thing back
de la cruz bistro will be a favorite for us for many years
in all a brilliant place
made for a very uncomfortable time
next time i go back i will verify the price first and then decide if i want to do buffet or order off menu
it helps that location is centralized and off the strip
we sat there for a little bit waiting but never saw her again
i have a few more reviews to write on the others ive tried
i ordered the baja fish tacos with corn tortillas
upon making entry we were greeted and offered to have the menu explained to us
so disappointed because i was so excited to finally go to this restaurant
id rather spend my money on the waffle house
why does it only come in vanilla when you have green tea and red bean on the ice cream menu as well
sour apple martini at 7
nice place but really go somewhere else
i normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule the food is never up to par and its a cattle call
the atmosphere is great
many unique items worth trying along with wingssaladsburgers
ive been working the fireworks booth in the parking lot and weve been using this place for the bathroom and food quite a bit
pricing is average compare to other pho places
at the lunch hour
perfectly cooked and seasoned
i will give 45 stars but well i cant
i got double stamps for checking in
it did not disappoint
then proceeded to argue with us as to how we ordered our drinks
ive been there for dinner twice in the last month for good reason
as far as the noodles they were pretty blah too
the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich
i also liked the spicy shrimp taco but most of the other tacos ive tried have been a little runny and not as flavorful
this order will change depending on the quality of the fish but oursman
grosse helle rume leckeres essen und lustiger name fr einen italiener wie ich find
you feel like you are in a dungeon
would we do carryon from them again
the pulled pork brisket ribs collared greens beans with sausage was all very good
during the winter the menu goes through a dramatic transformation
i could have said so though
basic food safety 101 also instead of refilling the cheese with a new container she just add the cheese on top of the old one no rotation of new and old  so no matter how food taste i dont want to get sick so i dont think i will be going back again
the shrimp dish was not even eaten and he said i was taking advantage of their service
we opted for what was left on the menu king crab legs shrimp and mussels
excellent attentive service
the snacks are great here too and i look forward to a breakfast soon
tried to get in on a sunday night on a prior trip to las vegas and were surprised that they were  closed at 900 pm
best margaritas in madtown are el dorado grille and great everything else
we loved chica
like all the other review said they hardly check on you
it is safe to say that i did not leave hungry
the red sauce is freakin delicious
if the soup would have been hot i would have given the place 5 stars
fatcat have strategy for everything in life
try the cannoli cake its so delicious
this place is salvadoran not mexican
16 galbi was cooked amazingly and perfectly tender was not that charred though i personally aleays love a little char and super juicy
the bartender did offer a coffee in return for the mishap but i didnt go to old homestead to try out the coffee
i just order the pho
on the opposite end of the spectrum and still in mandalay bay eye candy  the most godawful mojito ive ever had
for everything that we ordered plus tip it was a 100 dollars well spent
pros the view
they have a doggy menu that included a hamburger patty or chicken breast with brown or white rice
the chef paulina martinez came out so that we could thank her and snap a photo in front of the beautiful frida painting
but we got a variety of different dishes their chicken gyro plus salad the dolmades and their yalla fries
the last time i went the waitress told me no it had fish in it
this is literally my new goto for diner food
great deal great food
the space is beautifully designed with interesting touches and is slightly elevated from camelback road which gives it a nice view of the surrounding area without the sometimes grimy reality of west camelback road
it was a bit salty also
amazing veggie sub served with a ton of thin fries
i have never had any issues with my food orders here
she was on top of everything and we never had to wait for anything
great and easy location
omg32oz of cold flavorless red water soaked slimy tripe and a few kernels of hominythats it
the layers of flavors inside mars are very rich
these two ladies we met today are great ambassadors for this town very welcoming and friendly to us outoftowners
we get takeout and the rotis are so huge that they barely fit on our dinner plates
everything here seems to be a complete mess and needs some kind of a revamp
i love this place
hardly original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic wine bar in my opinion
im really surprised by the rating of this place
i wish the owner from this location could read this review
but this time it took 30 minutes to get my food
4 people that worked there saw us leave but didnt say anything
beet salad was sweet and had a slight tart with capers that gave a bit briny salty taste that balanced with creme fraiche and smoked salmon was tender and succulent hamachi crudo   the fish melts in your mouth with the truffle cream sauce that was  savory
fettuccine pasta  aubergine bistro  the pasta itself was good
the food wasnt particularly good i ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans
however the manager was super nice and because he realized how difficult waiting for food with hungry kids can be comped our entire meal drinks dessert and all
but i ended up unable to finish the one slice
i ordered on line and when i went in to get the food wow was it different than i remembered
the coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another
yes most is the horrid ticketmaster but greedy hob now has vip sections and price grades
we have gone to a few bws in the area and they are all pretty much the same
their pizza is pretty good  the 8 corner pizza is a great value and it tastes very good and the prices are decent
you cant go wrong with most of the appetizers they offer but i really enjoy their plates
i had the green caterpillar rolls
everything on the sampler was great but the beef brisket was by far the best of the bunch
i usually grab some iced black tea and run out the door but when the urge hits expresso is available
i dont understand why they wouldnt just give me a bag
all a 5 star dinner with friends
oh and very fair priced
every single time ive been there the waitstaff has been tremendous
i was afraid to let my fiance go to the restroom alone and insisted they go together
we all got burgers that were delicious and epically huge
first off we didnt need the appetizer thats how many fries they bring
als ich noch ganz neu in stuttgart war noch niemanden kannte und noch nicht wusste was ich mit mir anfangen sollte whrend mein zuknftiger studierte und ich auf den studienplatz wartete da bin ich gerne zu dinea zum mittagessen gegangen
fried calamari with spicy marinara san daniele prosciutto mozzarella and olives with grilled piadina spaghetti with three meats meat balls and marinara lasagna alla bolognese nice comfortable atmosphere
great big slices and the prices are pretty good as well
love this place before and after it moved i had been to this location before it was the place it was filthy and dark they made this restaurant beautiful the food is great took my son there last week had breakfast burritos plenty of food and the only place i eats hash browns because they are crispy
a mustdo at the epicenter
we explained that we were going to stay and eat and immediately received attitude
i dont care what a deal it was and that someone took me here
i was unfortunate enough to stay here last week
they bill their blt as the perfect blt and they arent lying
we sent them back  received fresh ones
the bartenders have a lot of fun crafting these drinks and as a patron i had a lot of fun drinking them
i initially thought it was a very strange set up as i am used to the ones in cali
not the case here
after my most recent visit i will not be returning
cant wait to go back
smash burger has the best burgers i have ever tasted
i cannot wait to go back
i started off with a flight of three ciders
tucked into the alley almost off the main street but the decor was pretty modern inside
i did this as a treat yourself type of deal to enjoy a decent sit down breakfast
service a bit slownot sure why
my go to is the chicken parmesan with all its caloric goodness
the steak special was a great deal
the crispy soup was really good it was a broth with some noodles and pieces of fried tempura
appetizers were great chicken quesadilla
it was drenched in sauce
not only is the food awesome but i was blown away by the fantastic service
got the grubatouille and it was so yummy and fresh
my wife had the quesadilla and was equally unhappy
the service is knowledgeable but casual and theyre always quick to joke with you or answer any questions you might have
if you are on an expense account and staying at mandalay bay you will have a nice dinner at stripsteak
peaches because it gives us comfort that they use fresh ingredients
not much on toppings and hardly anything around the crust
too bad i didnt feel the same about the pizza i ordered
this ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat
the food is not worth the price the service is really bad
i waited about 34 minutes for her to return to the counter not my table with a togo container
be cognisant of how many reservations you can handle show compassion and sincerity when an error has been made on your part though the food was good the service left a bad taste in my mouth
when your dogs are killing you you are sick of fast food or the fancy nosh you inhaled over budget sit here for a nice change of pace and a fresh saladsandwich
make sure to get there before or after lunch rush or youll be stuck for a while
im really torn about whether i will be back but i know that there are much better places to eat in vegas
i love this place im from new york and i can tell u these guys know how to cook from the pizza to the pasta salad subs whatever you think of is absolutely delicious this is real food as i always say family buisness are more appreciated in doing there craft then big restaurants everything homemade from the sauce to the doe this place is absolutely perfect a taste of italy in the beautiful desert cant go wrong with that and to you taste of italy cheers
there were strong spices flavours
the negatives to appear as a romantic restaurant it gets really loud even away from the bar area
id have to go back here for dinner or just drinks with friends to know for sure
the fresh hot pita bread was greatand it went well with the labni matoom   httpwwwyelpcombizphotoshedarysmediterraneanrestaurantlasvegasselectherahgjyxt1weqe5jtpwwherahgjyxt1weqe5jtpww which is dry yogurt mixed w garlic mint  a sprinkle of olive oil
we were led to our table and it was then that i realized the picasso not only has picassos all over the walls but also overlooks the bellagio lake and fountains
the place was packed on a monday night and the line long we almost left
they were quick to pick up the tips left on the table but not the mess
i got the short rib tacos appetizer  they were okay
we know persian food
there are a slew of servers expeditors and bussers all running around in comic sansesce tshirts
first trip i enjoyed a roast beef sandwich which was very good
the ribs are awesome
i put in another order coz i guess im here but seriously wtheck i was on hold for 15 mins on the phone even tho its another place thats my fault but waiting 40 mins for my order  it wouldve been understandable if the other girl told me that it was replace to another bww smh ugh
the entrees seem to be a bit overpriced  probably due to lack of competition
when we were paying the bill the waiter brought 2 mini bottles of amaretto to the table for a complimentary shot which i thought was a nice touch
our waiter was very nice and attentive
this hole in the wall filipino restaurant serves kamayan eating with hands feast for 15person including tax and drinks
35 walking along chinatown 2 i was hungry for vietnamese food
its rude and unprofessional
i found the crust to be absolutely delicious
flute  the bread was very chewy and tough to begin with
no one does that at an ice cream parlor
the service was impeccable fun kind and quick
all were great the flatbread was delicious and covered with fresh spinach you can taste the tahini in the hummus and the sandwich is amazing
i loved the care that each employee showed the ingredients and how it was placed on the pie even though they were slammed with customers
theres a fine line between outgoing and obnoxious
service was friendly and prompt
still tasty and filling
this place is the bombbbbbbb
while an upgrade for sure with a better vibe and food and wine list there are still a few kinks to be worked out
walked in were seated fairly quickly and then waited for about ten minutes before a server came over
plus the price on food is so reasonable
even the rumored original one in peninsula is really just a tourist trap anymore
we ordered a few salads the marthas vineyard salad with blue cheese and pine nuts dressed with raspberry vinaigrette is very good
lets face it
it came with a small packet of oyster crackers but those just soaked up the soup and didnt accomplish anything
have not had a burger here in at least a decade
also they had couple of dessert options one of them was cold gulab jamun
it was eye candy but just didnt pop in the mouth like everything else did
i went for lunch with a coworker
needless to say we did finish everything we ate
its a prime time for dinner and they dont have anymore uni
the dinner was beyond exceptional
so i pride myself on being a wing connoisseur as i eat them everywhere
ill be damned if i let a group of friends drag me to that dump again
our waiter provided great service and i really appreciated that he told me to best order my relapsesized burger cooked medium
okay bistro sports  pubhmmmokay
ick went here one night because the traffic on 51 was uber crazy and my bff was craving seafood
the meat here is very fresh
i am positive they reuse their oil for at least a month everything that they deep fried looks burnt
we were looking for something fast so we decided to stop here thinking it would be a quick and cheap stop
at 74th street and shea boulevard in scottsdale a combination of brewery pizzeria and pub fates emphasis is on smallbatch beer and woodfired pies according to founder and master brewer steve mcfate
cant be helped given the size of the business and its popularity
i cant describe it
its pure salt
food is well priced yummy comfort food
the actually restaurant is very small with seating for probably only 15 people but the service is good and if you get take away youll still be just as satisfied
with other food court option in the area i will not be coming back here
it wasnt as velvety as it should have been and didnt compliment the fish
the poutine was average at best and i certainly expected something a little more sophisticated than new york fries grade poutine but at a higher price
only con was the bun wasnt anything special or worth it
lastly if you go to the scottsdale fashion square location make sure to ask for patrick as your server
i love that they have vegan cheese as an option
food was subpar at most
he ordered brisket  hot links and ribs
it is cold and drafty
the prices very good and food was very good portion size  will visit again when im in the area
havent tried hibachi yet hibachi area is always busy
he is exceptional
they give you all the hot sauce you want and it is good
attentive efficient and friendly
i like having the option of going to pei wei
i kindly make a plea to the owner of swensons to open up a location on the west side of cleveland
i was here for a private party and service drinks and munchies were topnotch
i think it is safe to say im never coming back and regret even trying them out
the noodles are the perfect chewy texture and the bean paste is infused with flavours without being overly salty
the service was very welcoming and friendly
walls are covered with cool art and interesting pieces
choose your bun the type of sausage your toppingsso its a good minute or two before cashier takes the next order
its a small place but not as small as i pictured based off other reviews
id be careful eating at ruby thai
their meal size was also pretty small
you need to push 1 and 4 to unlock the door
i love that they are the first ones to bring this to las vegas
they only have have southern sweet iced tea bags for hot tea
read some reviews and since i could walk to detours if it wasnt a gazillion degrees out i cracked up the ac and drove over for some take out
this place is the best taco place in nevada
ultimately the problem lies in the rolls they have on offer
after we got the bill not only was there no compensation we found out that the price for the special was much higher than their menu items
i didnt but wish i had
at least the service is always good there
the only good thing about this place is that it is open late however the under cooked chicken and anorexic goat pretty much takes away from that
lets talk about their cocktails
food is fine nothing special overpriced as you imagine any other touristy spot in old port would be
there are are a few beers down stairs in the pub inside the restaurant where the bathrooms are they dont sell upstairs so go look
when i saw that they had fish and bbq it peaked my interest
we were looking for an dinner item at miku  they didnt have it for lunch but they totally bent it backwards n made accommodation to make that dish for us anyway
no drive thru due to location
ill return for lunch to try the blt grilled cheesethat sounds like its right up my carb alley
the chocolate it comes with is not overpowering
the lobster lady smiled as she handed us the huge chunks of lobster with a very light garlic dressing on a butter toasted roll
we have been loyal customers for over 4 years and sushi tower is always excellent service and excellent food
i ordered delivery and was pleased to get the food fairly quickly
im looking forward to going back again soon
the only negative is that some of the two top tables are pretty small
huge huge portions
i ordered eight burgers all of them completely different with so many twists and turns i was certain they would get something wrong
it was an interesting take on skillets but for the price and volume of food i wont be ordering this one again
i was given a little over a dozen cheese curds which were just kind of thrown into the small box
i ordered the cod
so for that i am giving it 1 extra star
the owners son came over a few times and chatted with us and all the food was served hot and in unison
it was incredible
if youre looking for a swanky place to impress your date this aint it
however the selection is very limited  theres no tuna at lunch and when you do bite into the fish sometimes you can feel the frost
i dont remember the pricing being bad either
you order your sandwich in some sort of pot head size joint penner or whatever the hell they are
i stopped here walking out of the mall and i very rarely eat at the food court i think the staff here did a great job today from start to finish
its unique for sure
they definitely created a menu that is unique not for the faint of heart or those that fear anything that comes from parts of animals that isnt eaten in the mainstream
which would be about 12 more than the 10 gobbler
only beef is that its not very big and they wont do reservations so it can happen that you cant get a table on busy nights
we were a group of 7  6 out of 7 ordered cora special including me
another home run
pricey but well worth it
friendly and eager to please
like really there is no other options i mean i understand that there is people who is hung over and need pho to be revived but having a medium bowl as an option would be nice
i am excited to see the finished product and will post a picture in a couple of weeks when everything is healed
its in the middle of all the forum shop stores at a dead end so you really have to want to get there to find it
our party of 5 was visiting fairport harbor for the tall ship festival
schmeckt prima sieht lecker aus und macht satt
the  lighting is dim enough to be seductive yet casual
we were there on a thursday night around 600 pm
very nice staff though
our whole group loved all the dishes we got and left with a full belly and smiles on our faces now to stay out of our food comas for the car ride back to la
it is kind of sad that the performance of the hibachi chefs varies a lot from person to person as the second time i went was by far the nicest to watch but all three were very good
highly recommend the dynamite rolls
the atmosphere is extremely nice and styled after many of the stylish restaurants youd actually see in tokyo
the service upon entry was indifferent
lobster and scallop sashimi really fresh
the pacing of getting our food was great
clearly we were done playing and on our way out the door yet were still told 3 times by a staff member just so you know were closing now
they need to advertise
i had a slight cold and the salt still shined through like the star of the show
wow okay
i was offered a side of fries or fruit and i picked fruit which was the usual fruitcup assortment of melons pineapple and grapes
i definitely recommend the protein pancakesthey were my favorite thing i had
this was the palazzo location
their cheapest beer is 550 and ranges to 9
this place is awesome
this is ok though as you are there to be in the pool i will say though before the entry man i knew i was with yelp he did not give me the time of day and made it clear i was not getting in and the guest list was closed for guys
im interested to give them another goround
im just so excited i found this place and so close to me
they brought out our pho while we were still eating appetizers
four stars for my attentive server who was quick to notice i was chugging beers like this was a highschool kegger minimizing any down drinkingtime between servings
the best part was the triangle dessert made from lychee paste and wonton drizzled with carmel or sugar syrup that was actually great
its either not seasoned right or not seasoned enough
i refrained from saying anything in reply for fear of spurting back obscenities
the patties like grain and vegetable and have a very homemade feel as opposed to the typical veggie soy glue served elsewhere
i cannot put my finger on it but it felt that there should have been more of an elegant feel
this place is off the chain
i wish good fortune to the owners nonetheless
while the whole experience is what people rate my burger alone was worth a 5star rating
brothers lounge was remodeled a few years ago and let me tell you the craftsmanship is awesome
i loved the great american food truck race who doesnt
hmm party of 25 or snooty waiter lives in restaurant and didnt want guests
i was a little odd at first but i soon picked it up in fact i really could have quite carried away with it
while we stood there he was on the phone talking didnt even give us the be with ya in a sec courtesy
i understand this as most of the dishes are slow cooked meats in sauce or soup
the sushis are excellent for an ayce place
i have to say that the bun is usually the best part of the sandwich
the hubs had the savory dutch pancake special
add all that together amazing food amazing ambiance not getting glutened i would give this place 10 stars if i could
i thought its quite a bit to pay for fish
can i share how lamb chops can make you cry with joy
our second visit also a weekday at about 6pm
service was friendly and food came out within a reasonable time
made for a filling dinner
i love dp so much
we started with the pepperoni pizza as our appetizer from their brick oven
the salsa and the services is off the hook
it was a quiet time to be in here
i cant say enough great things about fat heads and i will be back soon
sauberkeit der laden war sauber da gibt es keine einschrnkungen
total waste of time
we had  appetizer of the crawpuppies
nice and clean atmosphere
the steak came out as if it had been sitting and wasnt hot off the grill or even close
the service was simply outstanding we were treated like royalty and when one of the steaks delivered to the table we just a little overcooked they brought out the chef and insisted we allow them to make another
food is good quality so you dont feel hosed
the meat is just so rich and meltinyourmouth the bun and toppings done just right
the steaks were delicious and cooked to perfection
we ordered many things off the menu including the baked mussels
az kabob is a consistently great restaurant
this is mine and my wifes favorite seafood place
our server was fantastic and tried as hard as he could to service our table
ive been here about 5 times already and still havent had a single bad experience
staff was very friendly
my husband got chicken tacos
side of ranch potatoes is addictive  banana but muffin was a nice sweet treat
overall service was good
bilk was the closest and had delicious looking pictures
we will definitely be back for sushi and more of that good hibachi
who does that
i love this bar
oily coleslaw sauce from the bottle and a strangely thick breaded deep fried oval fish stick
location wasnt too full and was quickly able to get a table without reservations
food is decent nothing to write home about
i also recommend the steamed bunslet me just say these buns are incredible
i ordered the cedar plank salmon and swapped out the lobster mash for garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli
food awesome awesome awesome
everything was perfect super crisp green onions nothing soggy
we are very happy with the food and the service amazing
would not recommend this place to anyone
however if your just looking for a couple of rolls and dont feel like stuffing your face until you tap out they have been offering a 50 all rolls and nigiri for quite some time now
so here it goes wood fire beefcut in thick 12 inch strips
the beer is tasty especially the lager and dunkel
definitely a place to check out if youre needing a beer or a bite
the drinks are superb and the menu unique while being delicious
texture was perfect but needs seasoned
i always order the butter chicken all white meat
i stopped there yesterday and the place was empty
i will give them another chance but if they mess it up  this is it
if they last a year ill be surprised
so this was a flashback to my sonic experience
the r ambience is okay for a breakfast or lunch spot but leaves a little wanting for a dinner spot especially considering the prices they charge
how do you screw up a steamed 1 12 lobster
and then after that you get to throw all kinds of yummy toppings like salmon roe edamame sprouts fried onions and so on
didnt try it though
the guy taking my order was so unfriendly
want to pick someones brain about madeira malbec or argentinian wines in general stacy will fill you in on the deets
i could not describe how excellent the food is
will i go back
the fries were crispy and the coleslaw which i gave to my dad he said it was some of the best hes had at a restaurant
this for me was the most enjoyable dish of the evening with the most complexity and textures
but i hardly ever go to restaurants for udon so ive delayed my visit till now
next time well know that all of the portions are huge  we also split an order of the blintzes and a side order of the potato pancakes
line ups always but amazing service
each person in our group agreed that the food was just adequate
on any given weekday lunch you can run into local politicians pig farmers attorneys newscasters or entertainment performers ive seen all the above not on the same trip
but its money well spent
the worse customer service ive experienced
the service was horrible
its a mompop type place and they take great pride in serving some the best sushi in town
my wife gets the bbq beff meal and i get the bbq chicken meal always
i just had to knock down a star for the ordering experience
they pack on too much rice the roll is too large to fit your mouth comfortably and the taste is lacking
wellummmmmthe service was goodpausecan anyone here tumbleweeds blowing by
so loud with people talking over the already very loud music piped throughout the restaurant that we had to ask that the music be turned way down so that grandma with her hearing aides could stay
we were seated quite quickly i order the pasta di sicily with sausage the walnut house sauce with penne and a dessert
the whole plate alone could have been my entree and i would have left a happy happy girl
the huevos rancheros were so spicy and flavorful
sadly due to a relative passing i had to cancel the event
i know panda isnt real chinese food but nor is it americanized chinese its panda
leider ist der service etwas berfordert getrnke kommen zuwenig nach
the ingredients on their tacos are above and beyond what is on your basic protein in a tortilla
but we all know those who say it are lying through their teeth
thanks for the lovely afternoon tuckshop
you have to try the meatloaf  its pretty good
we had to send our food back and peter went over the top to make it all right
once this got a little cold it was disgusting strike 3 price is outrageous really for the quality of food and quality of service
if anyone had been to first food and bar you can understand how loud and horrible trying to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you and you cant because you will have laryngitis tomorrow from screaming
if there was no stars they would receive that
good shake consistency with amazing ingredients
will definitely be back the nervous waiter who introduced himself each time he appeared at the table never did come up with the sausage du jour info but the food was flavorful and the ambience warm
it was one of the better sandwiches i have had in a very long time
great friendly service and the brothers always have a smile on their faces to greet you
the squid was ok but not a lot of flavor
12charged 3695 per adult and 1095 for a child a price not inclusive of tax or tip the question of whether buddy vs brunch is worth it comes down to whether one prefers quality or quantity as well as an understanding of celebrity chef branding the recent buffet upgrades at wynn cosmopolitan and caesars seemingly a better value with superior service though certain items and the chance to sample several of buddy vs signatures without investing in a full lunch or dinner seems worth it for fans or those looking for a familyfriendly alternative to grand lux cafe while staying at the venetian
the manager owner i assume was sure to come over and make sure that everything was to our liking
the service was very good
really weird atmosphere maybe because i used to go there a lot when it was an hmv
ber herkunft der speisen anbau und produktion
990 for a cold wrap with tax
next time i think well try one of the margarita specials
service was excellent from start to finish they really make you feel special
she just wasnt getting it
my friend ordered the chicken fingers which were huge and i love that it wasnt too breaded
if you love and live for pho like i do then you must give this place a try
food was good but margarita lacked as it tasted like a mixer was used thus the 4 stars instead of 5
the food came out quickly  hot and delicious
came in sunday 7pm with a small group and was seated immediately inside
i tried them and the tasted like poorly done instant potatoes
now the fries i loved the fries
thanks rev team
i took 30 minutes to get our food
as usual this place serves quality dimsum and at a great price
i will be back
if you answered yes you must eat here
it might be a bit too authentic for some
i will drive out of my way just to not have to purchase from this store
ordered the seafood platter and was very disappointed
the gnocchi with lamb ragu and mint is okay but the evenly ribbed texture alerts me to this being a packaged gnocchi versus one made fresh
i dont like weird food or new food but after finding out about this gem at the scottsdale food festival over a year ago
but do try something here and maybe you might just end up liking it
the decor on the inside is certainly not what id expected from a bar in a shopping strip
normally when i get well done its a little tough and the prime rib i got here was so juicy it melted in my mouth
probably means in restraurant speak we already cleaned the ovens
easily one of the top 3 burgers i have ever had
i work grave came here to eat on my 30min lunch
pretty good selection of authentic style dishes chiles rellenos and other regional dishes
finally received some service and she was great
you can never go wrong at guarinos
1 last time i was there i bought the special to go  fries were undercooked
if you are looking for a solid sushi place n the east valley this is it
it was good but it didnt blow me away
my sons wolf pack meal was all hash browns
this place has awesome food and good prices
having ordered two chicken club sandwiches and some fries we found a spot to stand by the window and eagearly awaited our sandwiches
they have great food great prices on food and drink and a great atmosphere  both indoors and out
but we are very looking forward to try the new flavors we did not mind
you need sustenance now
seriously where else can you buy fast food tater tots covered in cheese
everything is amazing
this is easy  5 stars all the way
i asked her if i could wait for the next batch but she ignored me
its ok but theres better seafood in vegas
i had too leave early for hockey game
ate dinner here last night with the family
eat it or beat it
the tables were comfortably spaced
two thumbs up
come see massimo he will make you feel like youre at home
my main dish was the grilled lamb sausage with a crispy pita fattoush salad and minted yogurt sauce
great price and huge portions
plus they gave us a loyalty card buy 9 9 subs get the 10th free even though we just got 6 subs which was plenty of food
never going back i recommend anyone to take their business down loraine rd to moes in rocky river
it looked like the color of newborn baby poop
the decor is really calming
ive read some reviews and im confused because ive been here many times and it seems those 2 star interviews are people that are not being completely honest
im not that picky when it comes to gyros and already thought they taste great everywhere i get it but when i tried pita kitchen it showed me a whole new kind of deliciousness
we were charged 5 extra per person for being a group of 12although our server was gone most of the time
the drink came out and it was fine   nothing too special about it but it was refreshing and did its job as a nice easy to drink cocktail
will be back
luckily i was staying at planet hollywood towers and this place was right there n given the rave reviews on yelp n a friends recommendation we tried out this sandwich place
we had dinner there this week and truly were blown away be terrific service
what a hidden gem
the yelp reviews pictures looked pretty good so why not
the last time i was there was for a family birthday party
i ordered a brie and cremini mushroom omelet
it is light crispy nonbreaded and so packed with flavor that i just never want it to end
he  i told you wed be doing a lot of walking
we also had the mozz sticksfried zucchini as apps and it upset our stomaches even my two year old had a tummy ache
its a classic prime steakhouse thats very luxuriously decorated
i will come back
so moist and juicy and just all around delicious
we were staying at the boulders for our wedding anniversary and wanted to enjoy the beautiful room and view so we ordered pizza from lorenzos at the suggestion of the concierge
cowboy ciao is the best restaurant in scottsdale
heading into vegas this past weekend i wanted to make a point to at least try out a local eatery that is high on the list and interesting
we could not hear each other and could not have any kind of conversation
its just not good
i jumped at the idea and looked for our waitress
it would be decent if the price was 20person
none of the desserts were any good
a birthday was being celebrated next to us with a candle for the birthday boy
we really enjoyed our meal at chelseas kitchen
the best steak ive had in las vegas
it seems like someone read an article on whats trendy in restaurants and tried to shove as much of it into one space as possible open kitchen community tables dish towel napkins cleverly named cocktails avacado toast etc
bravo les boys et les girls
we came for dinner and the long tables were mostly full and we couldnt find a place for four people to sit down and eat
the brisket was tasty and had a good looking smoke ring from the onsite smoker
service was good at first but as soon as there were a few more tables and my food came out even when flagging down wait staff i couldnt get my water refilled
new favorite in squirrel hill
the sushi chef has issues
i had made reservations so was a bit surprised that i was seated in the bar area when there were available tables in the main dining area but not a huge deal for me
yes we could have sat indoors but we were assured the heaters were on
i find it hard to believe that this isnt the best buffet deal in vegas
who do they have working back there
the shaved ice had a nice and fluffy texture which melts pleasantly over my tongue
must try if youre visiting montreal
its disappointing that the service is consistently so slow as it detracts from an otherwise nice restaurant
but maybe i should have kept it because what came next was unacceptable
they have all sorts of combos mostly with beans or rice as a side get it
go to zuzu outside the month of december
a small mompop shop with a warm and welcoming heart
our food was really amazing as well
we had a 9pm reservation but it was 6 and we were hungry so we walked in cancelled our reservation and posted up to wait for a spot at the real bar
mango chipotle chicken is good
otherwise the other dishes were ok
just fyi if you are coming and i hope they get some alcohol in the shop soon
plan and simple
not my cup of tea but my girlfriend liked it
the service was lousy but the food was typical expected taco bell
and a raw smoothie bar too
the burgers are good as is the chicken parm sandwich
sure you have a generic chinese food section but that too is severely limited to chow mein n mussels being the most eattable
they also dont skimp on the ingredients
yummy everything except the guacamole was a bit blandmaybe it was just the avocado that was used though try it
greatest calzones ever
their staff at least up front tend to get in little cliques like a bunch if giggling highschool kids and give off the vibe that you are really ruining their evening by having them work for their pay
2  pho  we had the chicken pho and also a meat pho with brisket flanktendons
i usually go to this mcdonalds since its near my house and i dont have any issues
first of all i was disappointed that black bean soup wasnt available
you can easily off set this with the amazing array of topping
our server was nice the food was horrible
oh  i forgot her name but our server was so sweet  not at all bitchy about me using the gc
i used to go here and order from them alot
i was disappointed to only find one slice of chashu in my bowl
she was not presentable and had the worst attitude
the burger was soft and not too greasy and the shake though a little small packed one hell of a punch
the good  margherita pizza was solid  service was good there appeared to be almost as many staff as customers
i ordered from the lunch menu
i know the dining market has been  hit hard in t his area bbut i hope redendos survives
sowas nervt und darf in einem solchen restaurant nicht passieren
food had great flavor and i highly recommend the panuchos and sweet corn appetizers
i had the freerange chicken which was beautifully cooked
if youre hungry get the beefburger
no capg for you
i like this placesaw dust on the ground country music in the back great views and a small slide to get you into the restaurant
ive had some of the sausage board which is a nice mix of different sausages that comes with two warm pretzels
large is huge too
the owner harold and his wife are so friendly its almost scary
not to mention when you get a panara bread card you earn food
food always hits the spot
also even though it was the 12 mvp it wasnt even close to half of what we received our first visit
i mean i have been there twice in 5 days
to top it off they offer ranch zucchini fries which rocked
my beautiful fianc and i came to a pool party looking for a nice relaxing time and there was hardly anyone here
my favorite gyro in pittsburgh
i had the tuna tartar and the cheese plate wife had crab cakes and my daughter had spaghetti and meatballs
sales are pretty good especially around the holidays
if i had just ordered wonton noodle soup i would have been very disappointed
i know toast
a great view of dundas square giving you an idea of what its like
i like my stuff crispy but these were really overdone and the flavor of the shrimp was gone
perfect combination as well
wow i like this place
yes ill be back
my boyfriend and i have been coming here for years  its some of the best vietnamese food in the valley
plus they have good deals like 6 combo lunches small sandwich and a cup of soup
not only did they take such good care of us they went out of their way to make sure all 26 guest were treated like royalty
their walls are covered not only in rave reviews theyve gotten in the newspapers but theyve had customers leave their remarks and doodles as well
these are toronto prices in markham
the rolls were very tasty but some were very loose
80 flavors of wings and you better believe you have to try the spicy strawberry cheesecake pig wings that you dip in yogurt
would i be back
the best burger i have ever eaten
our food was not fresh it tasted like it was prepackaged and the portions were small
this is one of the best places ive eaten
no corkage fee  woohoo
they are always smiling and pleasant
delicious soup that just hits the spot
i can understand wanting to get home but thats not professional
we just had an event at this coco were we used the back room for 40 people
we had the platter or grilled pork chop and lemongrass chicken
the location makes it really convenient for me so i stop in sometimes to grab a roll or something quick for breakfast and it is always crowded
make sure you get here early for lunch because this place gets packed
not a good sign
apparently theyre hard to resist
excellent service and great food will be back but will not waste my time with the reservations
they were delicious
the chocolate cake dessert is enough for four people and absolutely delicious
when she returned with his food to go she picked my plate and asked if  she could wrap it up
sometimes its necessary to eat because i want coffee at an eating time but the purpose is clear
seabass 33 is amazingly soft melts in your mouth and the skin is crispy to finish it off totally worth every penny  banana pudding is yumyum
we were seated and given menus and a basket of warm chips and what is presumably house made salsa
tried the wings they were too hot for mild
good selection of beers on tap
after our 15 hr drive into the valley we were starving and as we approached the san tan mall we thought maybe there might be a nonchain we could get a bite at
all in all  it gets an a for the food and service
random people walking in and out making bets and standing around creates a weird dining atmosphere
not a problem
i enjoy perusing the aisles of the shop for things to pick up  their black bean salsa is absolutely divine
then the gnudi
i had maple chipotle chicken wings and fish pie with the wings being meh at best not exactly sure how does chipotle come into the picture  seems like there was a bit of maple syrup based sauce and thats it
this is my takeout pizza goto
i said the burger does not taste good
my friend and i came here and ordered two sushi rolls each
and damn close
the sandwich came on very small hawaiian buns and the chicken skin was too greasy for my taste
vegas  i have one of the hot feel vip card that a friend gave me so i told the waiter at the onset of the ordering
the staff was friendly on the phone and when i picked up my order
the fries were good
the flavor was filled with the effort you would expect in a slow smoked prime rib
we both had the eggs benedict one with salmon and the other with chorizo
regardless it was eaten
ive found them well thought out and tasty
its kind of hard to find
their homemade tortillas make the burrito
side note even the medium size is actually big enough for two meals
we should have saved our money
pretty place though
stopped in for dinner last night
i dont like sushi unless its well done so i had the serlion steak with vegetables
i arrived long after the breakfast crowd and the place was relatively empty
service is friendly especially britt g thank you ingo
my favorite pizza place
both are equally delicious  fresh pasta you cant go wrong
today was that day
i like this place
service was very good
malt vinegarketchup on the side please
the portion was pretty big  i couldnt finish it all so if you arent that hungry you might want to share this with someone else
the food was incredible
this was actually pretty good
when spending over 200 for a dinner i expect it to be fabulous
our table ordered the sake bomb special which was 80 and included a very small pony keg of beer and two porcelain tokkuri of sake
i asked the waiter over to explained that the portion was inedible
they are very fast and sweet in there
i know its a steak house but dry veggies and a bowl of lettuce dont try so hard now
its a upscale feeling watering hole manned and womanned by some of the nicest people we have met in vegas as of yet
and wow was i surprised
wieso find ich hier keine ffnungszeiten
must get 1 curry pork skewer  amazing
dinner 1 i was dressed as the borg queen and looked scary as fk so they sat us at the corner of the room
i had an absolutely wonderful salad with noodles avocado mango shrimp and more
busy little place must be patient
she avoided our table for the remainder of the meal until the check arrived
laconium luminothrapie quipements de sport et jen passe
if more restaurants were to move in theyd be in trouble
the inside of barnone is beautiful
the cran feta salad is probably my favorite thing on the menu though
got a refund and wont be back
we were seated at a small table in the middle and our server soon appeared and gave up a menu and took our drink order
you take an l from me sonic
restaurant was 20 full max
for our mains hubs had gnocchi ala vodka which he enjoyed
we had the meat pizza and the mozzarella garlic bread that they serve with quality marinara sauce
people i tell you now
if you like drinks with some substance to them id suggest ordered a regular mixed drink and not one of their specialty drinks even if the cheesy names like effen it in the raw call out to you
we didnt order an appetizer just ordered dinner
having a couple of pints i also ordered ale battered and spicy sausages
i highly recommend the buffalo chicken wrap which has a bit of a kick to it
this place takes forever to cook your food
waiter said its coming right out
the baguette was still fresh even though i came in the evening
the affogato for dessert was the best dessert ive ever had
but if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are
dont waste your time or money
the difference is service here is quite friendly as well as dining area and washroom are well maintained and clean
everything on the menu sounded great
it is a nice place to beat the strips craziness
and the service was impeccable and professionally friendly
price is now 90 bucks a person
bouillon bilk is a perfect example of why i use yelp
the potatoes and banana nut muffins are especially delicious
will definitely come back to try their bbqs  malasadas  and more garlic mahi but will pass on the poke
it did not look promising from the outside sandwiched between a tobacco shop and a dog groomers but we threw caution to the wind and entered
go here for the beer selection for sure but the affordable food is above average too even if its just greasy bar food
definitely a great spot
fresh quality ingredients and about the perfect amount
we love this restaurant
first and foremost this place has a great view
the restaurant was a little busy but our server got to us immediately and she was very professional and courteous throughout our whole stay there
i had the lamb gyro which was very good
ive eaten at the cafe 57 times over the years including when it was wolfgang puck and after as well
i loved their bar area with gradual changing led lights with these clear box layer on top
this public service announcement has concluded
a good brunch for me is a fair indicator of how serious a restaurant is about their food
the gentleman working told me that they wanted to start up a ramen spot on the east side because everything else is so far away in chinatown
make sure the manager pours your drinks hes the best there
i had this very tasty red bird rotisserie chicken  tamale pie    16  my wife enjoyed this very much alaskan halibut  corn flake gremolata  candied tomatojalapeno salsa    25  two people had hamburgers inedible so well done problem waiter never came over once to see if everything was alright
so in my opinion this place needs some management
tuna tuna was very tasty and the salmon and shrimp was great as well
came here for the second time today i live down the street from here but never came because a couple friends had negative reviews of this place
it seems as though the staff was not even concerned that i was actually injured and yet they knew they have a very slippery floor
the walls are 34 all glass so you usually get a nice view of the fun activities on spadeena
one cool thing is the pool is open 247
i might start shopping elsewhere just because of this crappy indifference at the checkout
he couldnt even pick the sandwich up because of how messy it was he ended up eating the meat with a fork
i cant wait till the drive thru opens
they tried to charge us for a side of dressing after serving us a salad that had no dressing on it
i was very impressed
we dont really like spicy food but it was a very good experience
on to the tacosmaybe i ordered the wrong type but the shrimps were rubbery and half the shell was left on one of the shrimps which was an unpleasant surprise
great food  a hidden gem
im salivating right now thinking about how good this burrito was
you could taste the freshness of the tomatoes
my favorites are the strawberry lemonade and their crispy cheesesteaks philly steak wrapped and  fried in a crispy tortilla hence the name
i think bella may have the best pizza in the east valley
the last tapiocalychee dessert was refreshing and a nice finale but hard to enjoy since we couldnt stop thinking about the hair
disappointing to say the least
we felt completely unwelcome as he chatted away with coworkers instead of helping us
he offered to pay or do something i said no thank you and went and paid our check and we left
please for your own health and safetydo not eat at this location
apparently she saw the notes on the reservation
the meat is always juicy and tasty
i will be back
i will never order from them again and recommend you dont either
ive worked in restaurants before and desiree certainly has figured out how to be amazing
the cookie dough egg rolls though were amazingly delicious
the ramen was pretty good
the bill was outrageous and we were hungry just a few hours after
ive been a fan of fuku ever since the first time i stopped by the foodtruck at a westside wednesday event years ago
the veggie burger is a hit or miss
not trying to be overly exaggerated
we were there for a late lunch
my recommendation is the following chicken shawarma sandwich put only the chicken with  galric sauce and french fries beef shawarma sandwich beef with tahini sauce and parsley
the fish tacos were amazing and the chipotle sauce they add to it made it complete
we paid the bill and left without complaining because we didnt feel like being there any longer than we were
design nerds you will appreciate the tiled counter and the reclaimed wood bar
tip if youre trying to go there during happy hour esp on sundays it is smart to just grab a seat at the bar if you dont mind grabbing a stool
went to this restaurant for a weekend dinner
walked over to harvest moon grille and had lunch instead
lets talk about this place
sat at the bar and was greeted by mike
this restaurant closes at 3am and opens at 1145am so you have plenty of time to figure out when is best to stroll in
moving right along mama ricottas is great some of the better italian food in charlotte as far as im concerned
wer einfach unkompliziert etwas zu sich nehmen will ist bei dennys genau richtig
understand that you cannot expect as much in the real food as it is in the picture of the menu
if youre looking for a downright phenomenal sammie go here now
love that its so close and dont have to drive all the way to gilbert for great bbq
this was a hole in the wall local gem
the cheese is perfectly cooked on the pizza and just makes your mouth water
i finally found another coffee shop that makes them exactly the way i like them
with their personalized posted drawing posted all over the restaurant i too decided to add my creative motif or saying to be posted on the wall
my family is from new orleans so im keeping my fingers crossed that lolas hits the spot
easy to shopping
i have some real hope for haymaker making it compared to the other establishments that have been here but some minor changes will have to be considered so they dont fall into the same pattern
great staff and definitely cleaner than your traditional vietnamese sandwich shop
come the first time to support the cause  youll come back cause its a great place to eat
the restaurant was relatively quiet and my companion and i engaged in lengthy conversation
maybe my multiple trips to italy create a level of expectation higher than reasonable
about 75 for a saturday night with calvin harris
was happy to see a breakfast place in my neighborhood
it feels like a place you go to for a great meal but if i was on a date and wanted atmosphere as well as food it wouldnt be high on my list
well today i decided to try them out again
the hostess said they are doing a special fundraiser to help people who have cancer with financial burdens
not the best
going back this week
when he returned his face was bright red and he was sniffling
the food was delicious and i appreciated the side of fruit to complement the eggs and bacon
yes i might of had a few drinks but i still know what good food tastes like
however the food is good and the servers are nice and helpful  i just think they run very lean staffed making it a slower dining experience
first let me say the young lady behind the counter was great
been here for one of their happy hour  4 pm to 6pm  and 25 off locals on monday
you feel the heat but it doesnt stop you from going back for more
try and find discount tickets if you can but even paying full price isnt bad the food makes it really worth it
everythings really oniony the salsa the vegetable filling the guacamole
i also got to try the 3 dessert sampler and i enjoyed 2 out of the 3 items that they gave
service was some of the best ive experienced
i think the fish was on the same level
hurry before this secret is out of the bag and prices are raised
for all the excellent reviews and fanfares of shake shack my family and i were not impressed
it was a little on the pricey side
the chicken was crispy and juicy but not greasy
not sure if i went in on an off night i went yesterday night but i went because of the high reviews
my niece said the p stands for perfect cookie
i hadnt been in quite a while until july and ive been twice this summer i was not as impressed as i had been previously
and i am glad
heck we had 15 different orders and he took the time to get our order correct
the hollandaise sauce tasted bland
next time we are in vegas we will be coming back
being overpriced is just part of the issue here
il y a une jolie terrasse avec vue sur la rue principale du centropolis et du colosus
lol  not sure how busy theyd be normally during normal meal times but it was pretty easy when we went
definitely not up to vegas standards
the owner is always friendly and remembers your name
definitely go there if you can
the location in and of itself makes it worth eating or having drinks here
the line up for kazu is always around the block this place is always packed to the brim
she said they quit adding croutons because customers didnt like them she did offer to bring some out and did
i normally come here as a last resort when everything else is closed
so many choices
it was so bad i even witnessed a family walking out and left their table because no one was assisting them for about half an hour
we regretted not having enough room to scarf all of them down
so this is my first time in arizona and im visiting a friend and i have to say this is definitely a must hit spot
great food great ambience  perfect saturday afternoon hangout
we got in a bit after midnight to meet some friends on the first floorthe bouncer let us know that the first floor is closed and we can only go to the second or third floors
you will probably come back a few days later it is that good
after we finished what beer we had left we waited for our server
more money stays in the state that way
or stuff yourself into a tiny girls sweater and hope it doesnt rip it was a bit ridiculous but i lent my friend my sweater so he didnt have to walk back to the hotel in the awful heat
the staff is friendly
after ordering my usual boneless chicken wings with garlic parmesan sauce i decided to order a special sandwich for later in the evening
great service  delicious food
i tried that too and just not my thing
the rillettes were superb with plenty of salmon character along with lots of fat and moisture
its a new business  met jay who prepared my sandwich  great guy who understands just how important a great tasting sandwich can be
inside is clean and service is good
food was average and costly
the desert was also overpriced and appeared to be store bought
i wouldnt normally order this so im glad this was on the rw menu
they also make take out orders
ive seen too many young ones duck the sneeze guard and get crazy with the toppings
service was quick friendly and professional
can you come take our order
i really love popeyes they have excellent food
it was a bit overpriced but for the amount we got it wasnt too bad
i asked for some siracha and the server grabbed the bottle from the table next to me where a single diner was waiting for his food
i want to make it clear that i do not stay so its really not important that some things are skimped on as long as the food is bombwhich it is d if i were to stay i would definitely do so in the bar and i would suggest the same to you
also the rice was moist and had incredible lemongrass flavor the spices were all very flavorful
kinda torn here
have to pay for each topping overall its ok pizza nothing special but not worth the price and i dont like my pizza burnt
where to begin the food is phenomenal
the customer service is also wonderful and shod be complimented on their hard work
from the moment my wife and i stepped in the manager betty and our server julian made us feel at home
great place for mainstream indian curries
if they did it would be thicker and taste better
ordered the arancini which was okay the cinque staggione pizza and it was really good
he will take good care of you
but they were still good
imagine if they had been given directly to the two year old
woke up the morning of new years eve and couldnt wait to finally check this place out
the cheapest entree is 14 bucks
3 owner stops by and introduces herself as the owner along with a gentleman across the room
i ordered the shrimp fajita and my other half ordered grilled fish tacos which were incredible with home made corn and flour tortillas
it looks like a place you can bring a date
the popularity of the place and the plethora of positive reviews and high ratings indicates that this might have some great moments but unfortunately not this time
their bibinbap rocks
when our table was ready they told us we could not bring in our coffees but could sit them at the front of the restaurant due to health code violations  no such code exists so word to the wise if you dont want to waste your 6 starbucks coffee then id skip going there while you wait
she was a nasty doofis with a muffin top and saggy boobs and if she ever wants to make enough off tips to buy support bras shes gonna need to attend a few more customer service oriented classes
wonderful beers and pub food
i love this place
food was great
menu is very reasonably priced and you usual japanese offerings
theres a huge selection of ice cream nothing too unique but most likely going to find a flavor you at least would want
a bit noisy but overall a good experience
we had a nice time anyway thats how we roll
after walking past the live music every night there are 2 private dining rooms and 7 private dining booths
im no expert on sushi but for my tastes hachi certainly delivers
wasnt a fan
the best part was the chicken which was crispy
they have gluten free pizza if youre a celiac i am not i get to eat that tasty gluten they also are corn free my wife is allergic to corn
we dont live in a fairly tale land where everything is perfect all the time people makes mistakes and restaurants are run by people
we love the unique menu and atmosphere
we had to flagged him down for any of our needs
they have at least 6 different types of noodles and several sauces for endless pasta creations
the only downside to my experience here were my initial thoughts walking in
the restaurant smell the toilet cleaning product tooeurk however the food was good so we would like the ambiance to be as good
i think service could be much improved if they had a dedicated busser clearing tables and helping out refilling drinks and such
the shelves in the restaurant itself are packed full of ageless classic memorabilia
my boyfriend who isnt a harry potter fan also enjoyed the atmosphere and his kyoto iced coffee
our booth had a tv mounted in it and that was cool
i would put the meatballs up to any overpriced dish on the strip
i had to come here a second time to try other soup bases as they all sounded deliciousno bueno
although it was very loud inside and the service wasnt anything to write home about its a great place to grab a burger or a beer which they have plenty of phenomenal craft beer and draft list
glad we tried this place
the hubs and i shared a vanilla milkshake well i use share loosely but i did get a taste or two
i would give a solid 5 stars but it lost points with me on the fries which are very thick im not a fan of big thick chunky fries
the poki poke for the hawaiians is amazing as was every sushi roll we ordered
homemade potato chips and onion string served with ketchup
other wise it was very good
the asparagus salad was wimpy and i felt bad for my friend who ordered itit was weak for sure
also  i was there during happy hour and got a yuuge margarita for less than 5
both very delicious
update food temperature has been good since but on average it seems to take 810 minutes to get your food
the witness really didnt care
sooo  looks like this place is more hyped up than it should be
if youre looking for a brunch spot that doesnt require an hour wait kalendar is your spot
he asked us for our drink orders just sodas and came back a few minutes later with those and our chips with salsa
the restaurant was empty when we first came in
trendy music and great service add up to a very good experience
mmmmhmm see photo  highly recommend
how can restaurants in toronto cop such attitude like they just own our wallets  are free to screw with our gastronomic wellbeing
my favorite part of their pizza is the crust
i really enjoy their donburi dishes which consist of either chickenbeefport cooked in a variety of ways on top  of rice
i love their rotisserie chicken
welcome to pineville
the food portions are just okay not great
the food is excellent
but thats where the meal fizzled
off to a great start i debated between the ham and cheese crepe  and the mushroom omelette
my two star rating is a bit deceptive though
the waiter came was courteous and took our orderseverything seemed to be going great
first because we apparently were dressed like normally people jeans nice shirt they seated us in the front
why did i give it 4 stars when almost everything i tasted was 2 stars tasting
we came here starving
the  favorites were the pitchers of four peaks hop knot  and the sweet corn pizza
eight of us went here for dinner on a friday night
this place is not what i thought it would be at all
the woman was very nice while extremely quick to greet us and assist on what we needed
that didnt happen
meanwhile the husband was poking at his food and making little soy figures on his plate i asked him what was up and he responded something along the lines off i dont like this it doesnt taste like sate at all i cant find any peanut flavour so i guess he didnt  enjoy his meal
the meat was fresh off the grill and lightly seasoned with steak spice
at the top of every locals list is moonlite cafe
loved this place
but the ingredients taste similar to what youd find at a fast food place
we could sit outside immediately or wait for 25 min
i kinda like my back and i dont want to break it
kothu rotti is crunchy and delicious
wir haben an einem der kleinen tische gesessen
they came sauce on and its a good sauce
highlight the spinach and artichoke dip
35 stars sonofaviche
you can get crepes any way you like
its basically a local secret if you ask me
they do have taiwanese shaved iced desserts but the selection is not very big as well grass jelly and tapioca are not options
limited and clumped eggplant zucchini2 pieces of basil
and hint its not on the menu but they do sell extra pieces of their fish on the side  perfect for sharing with greedy family members who loved it as much as i did
they say hello before you even get through the door
the setting certainly was less than romantic
when you finally track someone down to pay your bill she magically reappears
overall i would just recommend going somewhere else if you are out and wanting to enjoy a nice steakhouse
my sister and i decided to find somewhere with a patio to grab a drink for the first nice spring day
mars were great too altho i am usually not a huge fan of rum i still enjoyed the complexity of the flavors
we were starved and just picked the first place we saw that was actually open
my friends daughter had chicken tenders that were more like burnt rocks
my gf had the sweet  sour chicken
i think the cook had that planned because much of the food was charred to me in a good way
stopped in for a quick lunch
and what i got was the best injera ive had in more than 20 years
the service was very good
must add 10 for the four flavours soup base
most things ive had are full of flavor in a simple  understated way
get the pork sandwich without that garbage youll be happier than a pig in
their fresh soups are fantastic and they strive to use locally produced products
also the waiters were on point about their service
butter chicken poutine  12  for 12 the portion was pretty good and you are getting chunks of juicy and tender chicken
be very careful of the waiter pushing their paella specials
while the wait staff were friendly the kitchen is slow
the lamb was tender and mediumrare just the way it should be and the frizzled shallots where the best accompaniment with it giving the dish extra texture
i was surprised at how small the place was but it seemed quaint
i read about this place in the phoenix magazine as best new restaurants
the banana bread is a must
one simple explanation great food in small town environment restaurant
it may be better when cocos goes and the grand cafe comes back
they also have a yelp checkin offer to upsize your gelato for free
the gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried so they lacked that soft meltinyourmouth taste that i love in gnocchi
however if youre craving southern food go to dish its a far better value
im not sure why the severs are forced to wear bizarre attire though it is an unnecessary and disrespectful gimmick
i would return to this place based on that alone
my fiance and i stopped by on a saturday night for dinner for the first time
this place rocks
nice location right by the lake and within walking distance to the botanical gardens and the lakefront park
the tacos on the website came with salsa and lime
and their fried rice is very good
i dont about this
i heard the bar on saturday nights is hopping and i hope they take advantage of the patio now that the weather is good again
but its every day from 47 yay
there were others came with reservation but had to wait as well
regardless the food here is still delicious and would definitely make a great second option for ramen in toronto
we would of gotten a 2nd order but had to leave room for some of that good good the pho
there sides are awesome including the jalepeno bacon fresh ground mustard fries etc
pea risotto with pork belly was one of the favorites of the table as well as zucchini flowers appetizer
how about a tiny tasteless patty topped with almost invisible and totally tasteless bacon and a tiny little bit of onion without a hint of maple
not once did anyone tell us they were experiencing long wait times
i guess he thought we would run
this hotel is at the south end of the strip which makes for longer walks to things
i have been here twice and i am addicted
today they neglected to give us fries for two of our orders
they have a variety of sauces too
thought i would get a sprite instead sprite sucked too how do you screw up sprite
wow i got lucky when i found this spot amazing food everything i tried so far tasted great
the hub took me here for my birthday and it was yum
i sort of wish yelp had more stars for a place like this
they offered to fix another dish or discounti choose the discount which was 13 offshould have been complementarywill not go back
does anyone know how i could get ahold of the owner
devils advocate was full so we came here
definitely a palate cleansergood overall
i also very much enjoyed the crab beignet which was like a crab cake and the spinach salad which was served with a mild blue cheese sauce pear and pancetta
she suggested 2 wonderful daiquiris and was on top of everything
i took a few outoftown friends for the pittsburgh pierogi experience and ordered a white polish platter to share
my one complaint is that all the toppings are behind the counter
i enjoy their smoothies and breakfast sandwiches
i ordered something different than omelet seeing that the cook couldnt get it right
i got to taste some new and changed dishes from the menu to help them decide on new options for the general public people like you not me
you can add extra fixinstoppings to your hearts content
youll be better off going with another great vegas dining option
youre literally treated to a new plate every 15 minutes for the first hour and then you can ask for another helping of any plate for the second hour
one person working the counter can only assist one customer at a time
the server proceeded to tell me that the chef did not think a filet would go nicely on a caesar
the best part of the meal was the paella but the seafood here just isnt very fresh  you know when shrimp gets mushyrubbery when frozen
everything was affordable and delicious this will definitely be a regular spot for me
my dining companions didnt like that  i scoffed them down like a bowl of chips
but the food was so so
i had to eat around it since it was already in the sauce
when our food arrived the first thing we noticed was that our meat selections were lightly breaded with no overflow of grease
a bit pricier than chinatown
service was excellent so theres that
the bean dip  salsa were good but i didnt really care for the green salsa
horrible customer service
the dressing though  well its vinegar and oil
my burger httpwwwyelpcombizphotosp7pxqfqr7ybkmmi2j51udwselectfbxxyjmoalx3nvotkqlda sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny
our drinks salads and food all arrived at the same time
the one thing you can rely on is boring consistency with a chain like ihop so boring that you almost want them to burn your bacon to a crisp so that you have to complain to get some excitement with your meal
our order was taken promptly by a friendly server
totally a date spot
the owner contacted me from my last revue and invited me to the shop to try it again
food is uber healthyclean and fresh
it was messed up i called and spoke with a manager who was going to look into it
it might not be as decadent and rich as montas but that is also where it shines
the bar staff was very nice although it was hard to get someones attention at times
they also serve some chinese bbq such as lamb and beef skewers and other northern and western chinese specialties
food is great and the hibachi chef was excellent
oh and the breadsticks were good too
i purchased a macaroon to go for das mann which he ate while we sat there
this place was the most moderately priced restaurant i could find that wasnt cheesy cafe
when i got home i noticed both of the relatively small containers were less then half filled
i was also surprised that they do not have any table service to order drinks
what i did enjoy the most and have never had any where else before is deer steaks
we could have stayed home made the same meal for cheaper and eaten at a real table
we ordered a deluxe medium pizza however the pizza was missing pepperoni after waiting 30 minutes
managed to find free parking in the residential area
overall great food very quiet on a friday afternoon but wonderful to have the space and the restaurant to ourselves
but they make it just right
i politely asked them to turn the music lower and only got the palms up shoulder shrug
they also had great biscuits
awesome food even if you are not drunk
i will totally go back
we ordered the four wheeler as an appetizer and he took our lunch order along with it
not even wrapping them in a tortilla slathering them with cheese salsa and sour cream could even save these leatherback puke pouches
this is not the place for a lazy sunday morning brunch unless of course you are a very early riser
nine breakfast items and if your there after 11am you can choose from another nine lunch items
hey rock bottom pr if youre reading this the 14 of us spent over 1000 on drinks and food at arribas right up the street
not fancy been here for years and a great tequila alter
the greek wings were very good and the humus was tasty as well
dont get me wrong the food is good and the prices are definitely reasonable considering you are in the palazzo but they set the bar really high on my first trip in and have yet to hit the bar again food wise
for a couple of hours i was the youngest person there
i used to be grossed out about medium rare meat but i was wrong
all in all food was mediocre overpriced and service wasnt that great
ive been craving a decent bahn mi sandwich now for some now
i thought the restaurant itself had a nice thematic decoration to it and the staff was very kind and accommodating
free wifi with open plugs hard to find again and great music
i asked for the items on the pictures because it didnt have a description she remembered only a few
atmosphere was nice bright
the flavour or the paella was like my home in spain imagining that i actually came from spain and the salad was fresh and crisp with a light sprinkling of balsamic dressing
the dish had flavor and i enjoyed it
where a shop specializes in milk tea and hot pot simultaneously
the drinks and desert make the cut as well
we were given instructions to wait in line before heading upstairs to a live latin band only to be told we couldnt get in with our us drivers license
we got to the restaurant and were seated promptly
served only 11pm til the morning so its an excellent late night meal after 45 hrs of playing on the pai gow tables and drinking all night long
the lamb was cooked and seasoned perfectly
bottom line this is one sausage fest im always looking forward to
i drove up and thought i mightve made a mistake since it looks like a fast food joint
i love italian food and have been to many italian restaurants in town pieros fiamma parma by chef marc casa diamore noras gantaenos lavo carmine roma deli panevino pasta mia wolfgang puck pizzeria mastrioni spago and etc
as an introduction to indonesianmalay food this place would be great but for those familiar with the flavors of this cuisine it lacked the customary punch of flavours
granted they did have a large party dining with them
i think dannys has a better selection anyway
i love coming here
still the lunch menu here is worth checking out for moderately priced eats
it seems they have a very inefficient way of running things they dont have a bus boygirl cleaning up the mess
i can only describe it as bland white bread in a circle shape
why dont you give cousins a college try
i am a classic cheese and pepperoni kind of guy and their pizza is second to none
my hubby got chocolate and tiramisu
there is glass fire places several chandeliers views of steel and glass wine cellar swanky sofalike booths as well as tables with nice big chairs for each person
why cant you get your own salads
terry introduced us to the german chocolate cupcake that was out of this world
in addition to the duck we had the hot and sour soup spicy and tangy one of the better hot and sour soups out there and sauteed pea shoots simple yet executed perfectly
everything was delicious
loveee their garlic sauce
great place the wait was a little much but thats why youre theyre housed inside a casino right
since moving the south ive learned that one was must accept ive learned to be thankful for what i can get in the sushi department
i love this place
the green sauce is made with real hatch chiles
the restaurant was nice and clean and had plenty of seating
so they rushed through making it for literally no reason
arugula  prosciutto di parma with shaved parmigiano reggiano red wine vinegar and extravirgin olive oil offered us a lighter choice from the other two apps
since the portions were quite big we all got to share it
she did try to make it right and took one of the items off our bill but we will never return for breakfast
from the many delectable options i ended up getting the chorizo omelette
although both were a little bit pricey the taste matched the expectations that went along with the high prices
tonight we had naked cowboy oysters that were absolutely awesome
she was happy to spend the evening taking care of us and it showed in her playful attitude
feels like a milestones or earls
the meat was so moist that i literally felt it was melting in my mouth
hopefully i can find something yummy to feed my tummy
im salivating thinking about those little pizza pans of awesomeness
it is no surprise that i buy multiple banh mi when im at lees to stock up and share some with friends
considered a historic hotel of america
the fries were hot and crispy and the siracha aoli dipping sauce was yummy
we definitely go there when we go to vegas
its actually pretty neat on the inside
this will be a delightful goback
stopped in for a snack and drink
there was a line for the squab and one woman not only pushed her way to the front but proceeded to pile her plate with over a dozen of those little birds
i really wanted to like angelas
like his other place more meat less filling
this place is a bit more casual dining
great service exceptional food
they provide plastic bags for purses and belongings which was much appreciated
well you may leave craving the food again and again
always a popular spot on the strip so be prepared to wait if you are there are peak hours
dont get me wrongthis isnt my beloved 5star eggs benedict at the grand hyatt but is certainly worth 5 stars in comparison with its segment competition
any who  if your looking to go to vegas on a budget  and want to be near the heart of the strip but avoid all the fuss and hype of the main resorts  then i strongly recommend the westin casuarina las vegas
adrian the bartender shes the best told us what to order everything was so delicious she was amazing with her recommendations great atmosphere super fast and efficient service will definitely be back
they also play really good music in the barpool tablesitting areas
werent overly greasyoily and were tasty enough
came here for poutine week and loved this allin poutine that comes with sausage and chicken schnitzel on top of a generous portion of poutine
loud trendy and hip would be the best adjectives to use when describing the ambiance at stk
here on vacation for a month and sandys diner was the first place ive visited for breakfast
this is one of the best indian restaurants ive been to and that includes restaurants actually in india helpful note do not eat at any restaurants in india if you ever happen to go there jk why dont you try expanding your cultural horizons douchebags
i like to buy the dark roast coffee it is absolutely delicious
the yorkshire pudding was a little odd but more on that later
go with a friend
as for sides i highly recommend the fully loaded fries aka the bacon with everything poutine
my wrap even had a slightly charred taste a good thing from being warmed on the grill
if youre passing by chambly and are in the mood for smoky meat this is the place to be
the overall restaurant ambiance is nice and i remember the nice hostess seating us quickly
i was greeted fairly quickly i had the option of 20oz or 32oz
i appreciate a friendly smile and suggestions so much
just be quiet ok i ordered curb side pick up a large deep dish pepperoni sausage mushroom pizza
i would definitely recommend for a date or small party
and i agree with jason p in that the best sandwich in the burgh is the lobster roll
theres also a deal to make it a meal fries and a drink for 4 more it was yummy
we had a table on the curving banquette which places you pretty damn close to whoevers got the table next to you
whateves good thing i predrank
arrived at yard house around 445 pm
the garlic bread appetizer is the best garlic bread ever hands down
not what you would find in an authentic resto but seems to meet the needs of the local demographic
this results in a wait that could have been easily avoided
service was okay however until check time then they were quite rude about some gift certificates we had
you gotta go
every single time they are packed with whatever meat you order
my favourite was a gingerbread pear dessert comforting and familiar flavours
service is really great also
this time i tried the bomb diggity
the decor was very trendy and modernit had great ambiance and energy as we stepped in
the bf had the nico which was amazeballs and i had the catrina which was equally delectable
i was hoping that itd be more tangy than it was   portions were huge though
calvin harris was amazing and hakkasan put on a great new years show at midnight
i thought id try it
i have not eaten at outback for years so this was a really nice surprise
that said i would definitely go again
the rosemary focaccia was dry as a bone and the tomatoes in late summer when they should be at their best were mealy and underripe
really good sushi and service
hubby and i went with our evfn group
i appreciate the extra food but this taco bell is poorly operated and understaffed
we went for a quick casual midweek dinner and couldnt have been more pleased
you feel like a million bucks here alone
the hostess was super nice and accommodating to the fact that my sister was pregnant so she made sure we werent going to be at a high top table and gave us the option of eating upstairs since its two flights to go up and the main floor
when i mean area i am referring to the far west valley all the way to the far east valley and all cities in between
we were looking a reservation around 730 but all that was available was 615 or 830 we choose the time and the place was not nearly full all night
service was great though there does seem to be lots of staff moving about
i ordered and got a buzzer
we will and perhaps alter our course slightly and see where that lands us next time because there are simply too many rave reviews for this to happen again
again it was not busy and the three ladies working did not seem very attentive to what they were doing
nice and clean
im already looking forward to my next visit
the egg roll was fine the egg drop soup was slimy and so thick it seemed like a gravy not a soup
overall the service as pretty awful
my parents didnt like the dishes seem more oily than most other restarants in toronto to markham
the pasta was without doubt was one of the best
would definitely go back now that i know where this place is
they need to offer a sampler plate allowing many choices of dishes to try
im too young to die from cholesterol overdose
im sure the desserts are good too but after the cheesecake in nyc the cheesecakes and other deserts at goldman just dont look the same
for the slightly higher price are you getting a nicer room elevators that come within fractions of a minute rather than minutes and lan and wireless high speed internet access rather than just wireless
avid and passionate brewers having fun slinging their trade
we ordered the dragon roll and other random maki
it was yummy and very filling with all the fries
if you cant find something to occupy your interest here you should probably should check yourself for a pulse
quick to be seated and food came out reasonably fast
opportunities i like the build your own concept but for a gourmet burger with a gourmet price tag id like some options that have been put together by a chef as opposed to me randomly picking toppings
there are booths and huge screens you can get a good view no matter where u sit in there
shanghai food is one of my favourites and this place actually serves it well
we will be back
our favorites are the katy cherry the beyonc doughles lemonade the cristiano rinaldough and the russell kronut and it was all 9 for 4 large donuts
caused me to drink a lot of tea to balance it out
i have found my italian go to restaurant
having all that time to sit there and look around the place it was pretty disorganized and dirty
once again i tried the filet and it was doused with a lb of butter
i actually believe them because they only have a few
worth the uber from the strip
menu is continuously changing which makes going extremely exciting
dropped by this place today had the codfish fritter stuffed crab calaloo fries and salad
customer service is nowhere to be seen among the staff at this place
eating wings or ribs it was pretty standard in a city where there is bbq like there are starbucks in other cities
i asked and she said her name was vicky
other than the old man making the pizzas the rest of the staff never seems to know whats going on
when we were done licking our plates and boozing it up mike proceeded to bring us free bowls of soup
oh my god
strong but good
not sure if ill be back
part wide open part cozy brass chandeliers and exposed beams
but again dont order this if you dont like liver
it is your basic menu with some surprises and daily dinner and soup specials
the waitress was pretty good about filling our drinks but never asked me if i wanted another wine
best spot for a romantic date
the service however was warm and friendly and i loved the vibe of the place which felt cozy and authentic
i highly recommend this spot to anyone living in or visiting vegas
arrogant owners who think their guests dont have other choices get rude awakenings
tossed all together it was a huge portion that hubby happily devoured
we were sitting on the second floor which has some super slouchy couches
ambience 35 the space can hold up to 50 patrons when full 6 round tables at 6 seats each 4 square tables at 3 seats each and 1 table for 2 seats
this was a delicious find
the bartender is very attentive and always makes sure you enjoy your drink
i walked in and took a look at the chipotle style layout of food
i ordered the seafood pasta
at taj palace you can have all of that in a lunch buffet for just 11
i had a mango martini small but delicious
the shepherds pie irish stew corned beef and cabbage and the irish breakfast are always delicious
im not vegetarian but had the veggie dog with the red option
definitely worth checking out
i got the bonein rib eye and it was juicy and succulent
my friends and i were shocked
so i had the roasted and fried chicken it was ok but not all that
been here a bunch of times
the groupon enabled us to try a lot of their menu next time it will be difficult to decide what to order
is go back but i will be visiting one of their other locations
highly recommended in all respects  decor quality of food and wine good diverse menu great service and nice atmosphere
they cook it medium and it is so tender and delicious
gee i dont remember any conversation that went that way
what huge servings
it was luke warm at best
i have found that japanese restaurants in general seem to treat their customers really well but the service here in scottsdale was even better than i expected
but they get part of that star back for the adjacent gelato shop
i stated that was fine and i just wanted a cup of coffee
its career suicide
it was good but kind of small
there are several very good curry use in madison we just happen to be blessed with good curries
i really dont have the superlatives to describe what an allaround perfect experience i had here
the wait ended up only being 1 hour  fortunately we decided to head back to hash house earlier than our quoted wait time and our number was called within 5 minutes so be aware
tempura green beans were very good but overall i felt overcharged for a small amount of food
settling the bill about 14 each after tax and a 25 tip and returning a large portion to the kitchen we still had pub
the seating is comfortable inside it never seems like youre sitting right on top of another group
i had the chicken enchiladas my wife has the fajitas
although it was quite far i had great samosa chaat and my two friends had thalis
there was a hand written sign saying  closed early due to an emergency
everything was how do we lower the cost as much as possible but still make money from the clients
i liked it
she never cleared a single item from the table either
i dont think i can say much about their drinks because i always seem to be on a little bit of a mission and want to get in and out so i just get water and tacos
i just enjoyed the music danced the night away stayed close to my friends
and as long as their are employees like joe that work here then this is great restaurant to dine at
overall the food was decent but the prices  very high for pittsburgh  call for something better and more interesting
still this is a good restaurant and id come back
buddy vs had the perfect amount of food
this place is on the first floor in the casino next to sport barbetting area
pastries are from zoss bakery on cedar rd and are very good
my absolute favourite of the night was the huntsman stew braised short rib venison and pie dough crackers on the side
the cacciatore sauce was as delicious as it was beautiful savory and oh so right
i would have given a 4star but the service was really bad i probably should have expected that given that this is a french place
you get so much food and its so good that it always breaks my heart when i cant finish it
we ordered the lunch salmon piccata and a lunch pizza and it was full of flavor
will return another time and highly recommended
my sf friend was not as impressed as i was but i truly enjoyed the food and the overall experience
it came on a bed of creamy rice
hostesses wear smart white dresses and the ambience of being in a cool home like atmosphere envelopes you
we ordered konito meat cream sauce and a carbonara sauce with tobiko
i think they are reasonable priced for the quality which was pretty high imo
basically i fulfilled my end of that deal and sadly the waitress we had at rcc must have been having a bad day because her whole vibe was weird the guacamole was delicious but after asking what caused each taco to be overly spicy we were spoken to like children then like special children
the place was busy filled with couples and families and groups of friends like ours
seriouslyfind me a local sushi joint thats pushing out entrees like these and i will wear a britney spears shirt for a week
i ordered the cuban sandwich which was very good
and also didnt feel too great afterwards
shortly after they bring out this boat with all sorts of sushi
she was definitely professional well spoken and very polite
some people wouldnt care about the acknowledgement but honestly its the details the little things like acknowledgment and at least one check up thats factored in a good review i digress bottom line baskin robbins is better
it was good but just not my kind of drink
but when you are ordering a 135 cut of marbled and hand fed wagyu beef that or cornfed prime nebraska beef this is not the right way to prepare fine meatwe could barely taste the beef underneath the intense spices so but for the texture it might as well have been a 25 cut of sirloin from the corner store
the service was so friendly
but i will be back
super flavourful with that bit of sweetness that soaks into the chicken
two of my friends split a pizza with drinks while i went with half a steak and cheese sandwich with chips
the food was so delicious as well
this is a new dennysunlike some of the older dennys this one was nice inside  the lighting warm fixtures were modern the foam seats and tile were warm earth tones
i loved what wooden vine wanted to be and couldnt bring myself to admit that it was failing
you can tell they are very proud of their business and love their customers
the pork ribs were dry and not tender
i would hate to know what those sweaty wasted people look like at midnight
a great meal altogether
we were helping some friends move into their new apartment around wellington and needed to grab some food in the area
hostess i wish i knew your name you get an a in seating strategy
beware wait staff tampers with receipts to give themselves larger tips
they are mostly a breakfastlunch kind of place and are one of the nicest little holeinthewall places where the regulars go to eat
farm to table can sometimes be a pretentious hippy loving filled experience but this one was definitely tasty and enjoyable
most importantly however they have kept true to their mission of serving locally sourced splendidly tasty food
i would highly recommend this wonderful restaurant
we had the blackened fish tacos a crab salad that had arugula and rice a cheese pizza that was delicious with cheese made from a local arizona company and a dessert
the biscuits and gravy were good but last time we went it was a bit too salty
like with most of the sam fox restaurants the place is lovely inside
burger bar is very pricey too when considering the size of the meat they offer on the burger so one time try at burger bar is enough for us
pork dumplings pork filling itself didnt have much in flavor
the brisket was soooo tender the pulled pork flavored just right and the pulled chicken was incredible
the only saving grace was that they dont charge you extra to upgrade
i like a burn like this every now and then
my companion said she would have liked it if it hadnt been for the sauce  not me
i picked up a chai latte from the sweet looking barista and actually ended up asking her where to get the street car from
i was told it can mean anything you want it to
i doubt anyone can leave this place satisfied for under 40
the service was also very good
the boyfriend got a monstrous burger which he said was fantastic
that said the food was a solid 35 stars
very delightful atmosphere
ive raved about the keg and their high standards consistency and reasonable pricing
the highlight for me had to be the app  seared white tuna sitting in a deliciously flavourful broth bits of chopped vegetables and topped with a pinch of sprouts  a wonderful combination of flavours and textures
dinner we had oyster their selection is amazing and shared a bunch of small plates
staff was very personable and the food quality was fresh and tasted excellent
to start with the pool tables 2 out of 3 had problems with bills inserting
they even have a menu posted on the wall that tells you all the various burritos it makes
id go again for apps and drinks but i would skip the food
details of the vegas nocturne show have been sufficiently covered in other reviews but i will simply say that the show is hilarious and highly entertaining with a diverse talented cast
first thing i noticeits cold as heck in this place
cal italia 19  55 this is the winner of the food network pizza champions challenge and i wouldnt doubt it
thankfully the food stalls offer many locally sourced ingredients which is always a plus in my book
but the food is the main event and what a delicious show it is
its so freaking fun
sushi was better than the hibachi
dont forget your socks parents have to have socks on just to supervise their kids
as for anyone thinking of eating here i urge you not to if you have any shred of dignity
not a big fan of chain resturants they always cook my steak too much just my luck i guess
i asked for it to be heated and was told no
its fingerlickin good
this place isnt even worth 1 star
we ordered the korean tacos kalbi ribs and chow fun
he told us that our waiter was having a meltdown so he the owner brought the other drinks  thirty minutes after that no one had revisited the table for food or additional beverages
bonus they now have grape flavoured soju
first of it was monday morning most of us hungover really hungover it was a group of 12 with out resevations and they had no problem seating us in a few mins
great fast food that wont leave you feeling greasy afterwards
will surely go again
this jackinthebox is close to where i work so i thought i would give it a whirl
our coffee cups were never empty the server was really on her a game
we were saying oooooooh look at it now
the view is phenomenal food can be purchased from any 24 hour diner
it was incredible
the best part is the free unlimited ice cream you get while dining in so bring the kids
just ate here while on vacation with my gf
truffle pide  tastes great
smaller menu but everything was delicious and nicely priced
2 you know you are not in good hands when the service at mcdonalds seemed more high class
north scottsdale gem that never disappoints
as for the desserts i have only had their baklava but it has always been fresh and wellpresented
the price was a little high in my opinion as my meal with a drink was 11 bucks and change
the food wasnt up to vegas standards for the price we paid and we were treated badly by the hosts and the servers
then i was taken in by their epic grilled cheese sandwiches  built on thick texas toast and grilled to crispy perfection
it had beans on it
they get 5 stars for the amazing beer that i love they lose 1 star for terrible service and another for ridiculous prices
another taste thrill
for lunch i really like this place
awesomeness at its finest
the sauces are to taste
he walked up to me about three times attempting to get my order and as soon as i started talking he walked away to do something else
and said we could get a discount off our meal winning
service was friendly and welcoming
looking forward to the next visit and this is one worth checking out to warm you up in the colder months
they were also prepared well
the hostess at the front was nice sweet and had a great sense of humor
not the best fries ever but good they could be double fried and use yukon golds and they would probably be closer to awesome status
the biggest problem was the bun it was hard and chewy and after a few bites i decided to just leave it and eat the burger
the food was amazing the carne asada was perfect and so was the michelada very satisfied
chicken in original did the trick but was a bit disappointed that they dont have corn on the cob any more
they have large screen tvs playing the hottest games for the bar patrons
the reviews were very good the restaurant was close and there was a good time available
i probably came at the wrong time and ordered the wrong food
the place is pretty busy which seemed like a good sign
the variety of poke was excellent
cowboy steak is off the hook and short ribs just fell apart
but the cookie is superb and crumbly as it should be
seafood was ok  the crab was good but hardly worth 65
nachos get soggy but the time you get to the bottom but they come out piled high
its going to be difficult to change up my lunchtime rotation because im hooked
my steakloving boyfriend was in heaven
came here for the 3 course prefixe lunch
windows and fans were on as if trying to clear out the horrible smell
i wont repeat verbatim what was said but the only thing missing from that scene was a gigantic confederate flag
edible if they just used an industrialsized jug of foodservice teriyaki sauce
so we went somewhere else and decided to come much earlier the following night
ambiente ist sehr urig und gemtlich
simply put 7 west does not inspire that in me
our waitress wasnt the best very loopy spacey wasnt sure about the menu
all were way above the norm
the server was fantastic with that saidthe food tasted like it was canned sauce
for our meal we had1 the truffle fries which were perfectly done and accompanied with 2 house dipping saucesyumm 2 hells kitchens burger which was very tasty 3 american burger which was also perfectly done and flavorful and 4 the damnation chicken burger
robertos is yummy for sure
i tried to eat it but ended up sending it back and i am not in the habit of sending things back
the space is beautiful and very open
youd think this would be okay until you realize no one can figure out who the hell is responsible for the various tasks that make a meal out refilling drinks taking orders actually serving the food etc
the bistecca flatbread was a light and tasty appetizer especially with the spinach on top
breakfast was fantastic the pastries were delicious and they serve illy coffeethe proprietor is accommodating and we will absolutely be back
if you want to eat good korean
wont be returning
my friends got the biscuits and gravy and his was cold too his 2 eggs over easy were so undercooked that the egg white was still runny and not cooked
when eating in quarks bar a klingon woman came up to me and got all in my face saying you look like youve never seen a klingon woman before
after all it is really close to home
i watched the cook go from eating his dinner and drinking a red bull at the bar to go into the fully visible kitchen area and not once wash his hands to cook an order
terrible service and food wasnt worth 38 dollars
everyone was highly satisfied with their selections
i do hope this place does well either way
we love this place  always terrific
we essentially paid 300 to waste our night away and miss his birthday event afterwards
the salads are great and they have some really tasty dressings tahini lemon
they have a nice selection of nibbles wine and sweet treats too
french onion soup here is really good
biscuits were awesome
organic soda from tractor is a welcome option
and so much burnt garlic that was so hot it was hard to eat
i cant give it 5 stars because the burger didnt blow me away and i cant give it 4 because it was overcooked for how i ordered it
also they have all day all you can eat
ok i gave this place the benefit of the doubt by visiting a second time but when we visited for lunch they still continue to have major issues with the place
youll definitely be sitting next to your neighboring diners closely enough that they could lean over and ask what that dish is that is making your eyes roll back in your head so i wouldnt expect a private romantic dinner
not a pleasant experience i like to find the positive in most anything but trying to do that for this location of famous rays pizza is going to be a challenge
i had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once but myself and the individual i was with we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait
experience 3 51017  it had been a couple months and my mom was interested so i took her
there was so much garlic and flavor i couldnt believe it
the atmosphere is very much a miami vice type which i read in another review
for 395 the portion was relatively small
washroom was nice too
the warm anchovies was such a delicious addition to the caesar salad
we took a look at the menu it was pretty straight forward and immediately decided on the kobe burgers  i mean if this is a burger place the kobe must be the best right
their staff is always friendly their machines are loose with low denominations their comp policy on drinks is ludicrously lenient and they have an amazing restaurant
we asked for an appetizer and it never came we asked for coffee and it never came
this place is a joke
staff was very friendly and on top of getting us drinks while we waited for our table
the service was quick and friendly and the prices are very reasonable
this is and was a great spot to eat food was awesome
however i had time to digest each course before the arrival of the next one
hoping they can work the kinks out
we arrived and were seated on the patio right away
just wish they had a bigger selection of drinks
very well chosen selection of european old world wines at very reasonable prices
on this trip i had the asian salad and it was delicious and very large
i doubt i will go back here
a friend took me here for lunch one day  the food was so delicious
they had a place where you can leave your umbrella near the front door which was convenient for people coming in from the rain
awesome food and drinks
that guy earns his tips
finally found the place behind the taco bell on bell rd and sat down to examine the menu
we started off with an order of beignets
i hope this review and others help someone else in time to go to a reliable heating and airconditioning company
never again i will be here after 12
honestly who cares about what this place looks like its all about the food here
the staff was very friendly
we had the cheese board which was a good mix of cheese nuts dried fruits and a selection of breads
have been here twice now and wanted to make sure the second experience was as consistently average as the first before i wrote my review
besides being super knowledgable about the menu he waswell awesome
when we sat down it took a while for our server to come over to us  ask for drinks but it was super busy so it wasnt a big deal
overall there is nothing chiu chow about it and is unmatched with local chinese restaurants in markham
seriously just walk across the street their general tso is way better
id go here again for an event but never never for a night out
the so and i walked in and didnt see a hostess stand which we thought was weird
weve driven past this place several times and recently found a coupon in dollars and sense
the amount of filling to sandwich was  1090 bread which is terrible
and the prices before 6pm were super cheap
great to go in  the summer because you will feel like you are in another country
it was great but uninspired
so check it out if you are in the area
the reception was fantastic
hands down the creamiest flan i have ever tasted
i understand from my wine drinking friends that the wine list is huge and great
ps service was horrible
in some places this can feel a bit pretentious but there is definitely none of that to be found here
just ordered from here for the first time
ventured to try the halibut over the weekend  fabulous
i was recently there during ces and took some of my business clients
there were 4 different chips2 had various spices one had the taste of powdered sugar and the last were sweet potato
the chips have been stale two out of three times
i was there every tuesday in college for groovy tuesday  1 off gyros  and i was probably there at least one other meal each week
comes sizzling hot each time
when i do not eat amazing curry i almost need my favorite curry to make up for the not so great curry
sans tre une experte de la bouffe hatienne ce resto se rapproche beaucoup de la bouffe traditionnelle les ctes de porc sont dlicieuses tendres et justes assez releves assaisonnes de cannelle cumin et clou de girofle
tried the nomnom and alien both vegan style and very good but loved the alien burrito bestand their classic mocha was awesome
its in the bazaar shops near ballys a tiny stall in one of the shop rows
i got a bucket of original recipe chicken it came with six huge pieces  three yummy warm flaky biscuits with honey  creamy whipped potatoes and gravy  and i added a little side of their fabulous creamy coleslaw
i honestly dont know why i dont go here more often
try the spicy pork fried soft shell crab combination fried rice as far as nonsushi goes
just sayin now for the review  this is a big bar far from downtown madison right off the beltline highway
everything was to our liking
on to the food i had the eggs benedict classic i call it the litmus test for all breakie joints it was about 12 but it was worth it heaping hash browns for 2 i had extra cheese on top and a huge fruit and berry bowl
i thought all timmies were pretty much alike but this one proves me wrong
their desserts are so good too
the food did not meet my expectations whatsoever and was rather dissatisfied
i also was glad i didnt check out the recent reviews of the restaurant not sure what happened there until we were already seated and ordering otherwise i would have missed out on such a great experience
they said they dont accept it anymore
the actual item did not look like any of the pictures im afraid and i found the bread to be of low quality  i would definitely not recommend any of the sandwiches that use this style of bread
the burnt ends were also cold and full of fat
we ordered bbq pork but were given bbq ribs really
it is so basic and i can make those at home but for some reason captain bills just makes a damn good blt
theres something about a free standing hash house building however that really themes the experience
my friend took me here when i was visiting and they have a varied menu so finding something that suits everyone should be pretty easy
the food was beautifully presented and full of flavor
my wife loves the place for the roasted jalepenos and onions
i would have given this place 5 stars but recently the young brunette girl at the front was very rudewhen people walk in please smile and be welcoming
not to mention the food is absolutely wonderfully delicious
when i called back the guy who would not give me his name refused to rectify the situation at all
his only complaint was that he asked for french fries but he got mashed potatoes instead
the contents were lightly tossed in a tasty caesar dressing which was so delicious that i requested a side as did hubby
we waited up front for about five minutes as no one was managing the hostess station
jai hte de repasser dans hochelaga pour pouvoir les tester
if you havent been here you must try the lady
first experience and certainly wont be my last
it was so good and the price was awesome
the service was friendly and the set up for watching football is awesome
we arrived at 1250pm and we were seated at 115pm
will definitely return here
i ordered the brisket taco and the veggie taco along with a well margarita
you get to choose a sauce which they mix up your proteins in so each piece is covered they also offer masago as a topping for no extra charge
if youre a wing lover def worth checking this place out
its possible to eat for around 1015person at this humble danforth joint and is a decent choice if you want something cheap and be on the way elsewhere in the area
so i went in ordered a chicken caesar salad
it was before noon on a weekday and luckily we had gotten there at a decent time there was plenty of open seating
the band was fun and the pretzels were good
tip they have chili grind
we visited on sunday june 19th at 500 pm  this was the first time my dinner companion has eaten at pita jungle ive eaten at this location numerous times
love the decor
i would never recommend this place and quite frankly would never step foot in this establishment again
3 we ordered crab legs and steak with asparagusall to die for
good sandwiches salads soups
please come check this spot out
the food is fresh service is great
customer service lacks
the service is always quick kind and mindful
im sure there are things lotus doesnt do as well as thai style
got reservation for 1130 which is well past our bed time ha but didnt want to miss this place seeing all the amazing reviews
however there were just way too many bones so be extra careful when eating
the ribs per my friends were ok i had the duck confit panini which was good but very heavygreasy and ended up taking half back home
we were seated promptly though strangely we were not greeted for several minutes
not expecting the servers to be nice been here many times but sometimes the food takes forever to come
ate upstairs in the bar service was polite and friendly but slow and inattentive
come here and eat
dont depend on being able to order food here ive been left hungry on more than one occasion when the kitchen certainly should have been open
its just the regular chicken teriyaki with some red chile sauce drizzled
all burgers are 750 and normally the bacon cheddar burger i received was 12 so it was a great deal
this place is so good
they also tried to give me a tiny one ounce container of guacamole with my order of chips and guacamole
when we both finished we both came to the same conclusion
i was very happy to see that it was very contemporary and wellkept
from start to finish it was very classy all the way
nice wine  specialty drink selection
te dulce con azucar sin melocotones
when i see meat ball sandwich in an asian joint im thinking and asian pork meat balsl
i would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are staying at the resort
i called on friday night 03042016
i love chinese food in toronto
sehr schn gelegenes lokal mit sehr sehr guter kche
stick to downtown gilbert if you want an amazing breakfast every time
when the food arrived my eyes widened
it was nice and bright tasting with fresh berries in the glass
i recommend staying on the side of hotel not on rue dberri as it is quieter and overlooks the charming rue st denis
guess im gonna keep on keeping on finding the right place for chinese foods
yes im talking to you random dude who demanded a chai latte when i was brunching the other day
overall a must see landmark for the west island croud
the rest of the service was prompt and the food was good as usual just watch out for jess
the fries were awesome
the fries taste fresh never frozen like the come from real potatoes
there are these cute containers of popcorn on the table
we also ordered a margherita pizza to share and loved that too
we had a straight view to the kitchen from our booth and it looked busy and clean
the playground also had an electronic touch game
we asked the staff about this and the teenage chef at the oven rudely stated that that was how the oven made them and nobody else had ever complained
place seems needing a renovation
the other two were not as bad but were just not good the flavor of both werent appetizing at all
they were amazing
but im just being greedy
stopped in here because the bar looked intriguing
customer service was a1
asking the waiter if there was something missing she said no
i would pass better off you going to chipotle next door
ill eat some crazy spicy things so when i ask for extra spicy i want them to bring the heat and bring it they did
great french dishes ordered quiche french toast cheese omelette croque madame and coffee
thats what um talkin bout
the pho was really good
its my fast food of choice
the place is chopped up with little spaces every where
love love love coming here to relax or to hang out with friends
the boyfriend  i were excited to try this place out after seeing all the pictures of the colorful drinks  yummy looking desserts but left angry  extremely disappointed
pros great ambience and decor cons long wait for food overpriced lunch items inattentive waitstaff
dissent wine selection
we had fast service and our food came out quickly
be warned tuesdays can get pretty busy with 1 burgers from 5pm to 7pm
i was so disappointed  never coming back to this location
sushi pizza is to die for
walked down to the barno contact wellthats about enough of that
ive been coming here for years and not once did i have horrible service like today both employee named megan and her supervisor had the worse attitude with myself and my friends when we asked the dark haired supervisor if they sold ranch she stated no i dont sell ranch but we have it nice customer service
it always seems to be lacking in the protein department
wish there were one of these in phoenix
second the music was so loud that our waiter missed some of the dishes that a guest at our table ordered
the employees are all nice and make a point to get to know you
got a medium pepperoni pizza for three to go
id also say its like a chipotle mixed with a gordos
the food was delicious as you would expect from this chef
not even a one star if there is any terrible service and horrible taste of food
ck starts to cry
acceptable at best
try the baked rigatoni its awesome
our server melissa right off the bat seemed to be in a bad mood as well
when i called i quickly learned you can not make reservations on the patio everyone raves about
the food was sub par at best
mu husband and i visited here to day and had a wonderful experience
by the time of this review ive been around yorkdale a couple times and havent thought to visit
not every nyf is made the sameas i learned grabbing a quick poutine today
used to love this place i received delivery from them for years
und da die auch gut schmeckte war es mir recht
we had it pulled up along side the table and it wasnt causing any kind of obstruction
alex is an awesome server
went today for the first time
i didnt think id be able to find good greek food in az especially mesa but this place is sooooooo good
that first bite made fireworks go off in my head
small and quaintwell suited for the area
enjoyed the outside patio area
friendly helpful staff clean facility excellent food at reasonable price
loved this place
my favorite is the lengua beef tongue and cabeza beef head tacos
so its authenticity is not something i can vouch for
everyone here is very friendly and the small sitting area is always clean
this time i went with the chicken bulgogi chimichanga
but as a byob
cant handle stress
the pimento cheese was creamy and the pickles were thick cut and provided a crunch
i usually order fish tacos along with chips to utilize the salsa bar
no only are there the premium salsas there are black beans and pinto beans cucumbers limes the spicy carrots and onions and grilled jalapeos and onions
i wish that i could tell you how me and two girl friends wound up in this empty restaurant at 10am on new years day
did you live in mexico
a friend and i were trying to decide on where to go for dinner and this place showed up on yelp
oh wow i am drooling thinking about this dish
im quickly falling out of love with this restaurant
i love craft beer
what happened to enjoying the food and the atmosphere
the other aspect that i felt was lacking was in the noodles
its definitely a great place to have some coffee in the morning or catching up with a friend for brunch
but we didnt even finish our dishes
but i went for it anyways and was rewarded for my adventure
the thing that bothers me is the amount of apathy for the store overall its awful
seriously there were 4 of us and we all agreed the food was terrible in both presentation and taste
i especially like the melon shake if you wanted something sweet
i wouldnt be so confident if i wasnt used to eating sushi
i came on a friday evening and they had a dj
we were seated and brought some water then had a bit of time before the server came and took our order
the stew didnt wow me but it was tasty enough
flavor was not bad
ive been to this place two times already since it opened two weeks ago and the service is always outstanding and consistent
they treat you like shit for no reason
you dont like it
my food was alright but knowing i came all the way down from markham was a piss off
but the star of this menu is the sugared salmon
as for the food oh my goodness
not only that it was huge
all were good
i have a gluten allergy and was very explicit with my server that i needed the gluten free bread my peanut butter sandwich prepared separately and make sure that the side salad i substituted my fries with didnt have any croutons
because they really only sell two products
i usually hate being difficult and demanding like that but this was really not ok clearly theres still something funky going on with the ventilation or lack thereof
blueprint needs some work
the menu did have a chicken offering accompanied by mustard spaetzel gnocchi with vegetables and  weirdly  a croque madame
i loved the sweet and spicy cucumber salad and the beer was as cold as could be without icing up
my margherita pizza was nice but not amazing and my friends pasta was also good but not todiefor
this is one of my regular stops every sunday after attending journey church down the street
the food is amazing
i had no expectations from this strip mall restaurant so i was not disappointed but what a disaster
regardless it isnt enough to keep me away still love this place
will be coming back
food was good
so her drink some warm fresh bread and the lobster bisque came pretty quickly
was not able to see this until they raised blinds
my favorite is the pecan crusted halibut that was on special one night
service was great
heres what i had diavola pizza the vortex pizza southwest chicken pizza hawaiian pizza classic gluten free pizza  they were all very good
stopped into locale on our way from pearson to cottage country
considering there not french and not from la dure yes im very picky about my macarons the were oke
the line kitchen is open and visible from the dining room
havent been here for a while
went there on thursday night with my wife
the veggies were just too boring with no seasoning
ich habe das beste wiener schnitzel kalb meines lebens gegessen besser wie im weissen rssl am wolfgangsee
just for some napkins
im all about condiments
good food great servicevisiting las vegas and found this place
awesome thin crust and the toppings were plentiful
i am more of a dungeness crab eater because the meat is more easily accessible and come in bigger chunks
giving 3 stars because the beef dish was way too sweet and some of the beef overcooked  too ropey
ive only been once so far but will definitely be back
it is directly behind all the taps at the indoor bar or stage bar and gives the whole room a great view of whoever is wailing
the fresh green beans has the distinct taste of a tin can
im vegetarian and love the trio app with potato skins mushrooms and crispy fried pickles
the food is okay
it looked like the spinach was barely warmed up in a pan giving it a strange texture and it was so salty it was fairly inedible
meh not again
oh my gosh i never knew chicken could taste so good
good chef and helpful staff
i used to come here a lot when it was aladdin and shortly after it became ph
we ordered their classic tasting menu which to our estimation was not worth what we paid for
price was worth the  serving size
basically they have increased the number of cashiers and increased connivence for the guests by making the process automated
cant understand why we were not served the fresh warm bread
try the hazelnut chocolate and enjoy a few moments of scrumptious gluttony with your coffee
anyway this place was great
huge plates of speciality poutines seem to be a hallmark of this place
i enjoy their cold brew
the food does not look anything like the pictures
awesome decor throughout with bright colors and a nice patio
also voted 1 pho in las vegas
their eggs are very bland as well scramble has definitely changed
i tried to give them a second chance after staying away the first time i was here
as i walked out i told the host i never got a menu he said sorry have a good night
in all honesty you are paying for the experience not so much the food
came in on a friday after work 10 minute wait not bad
their butcher is awesome and far different from retail grocery chains in phoenix
items ive ordered here  19 signature short rib benedict  braised short ribs hollandaise crispy potatoe cakes  phenomenona
the quality is worth the splurge
i was in mesa for business and decided to cruise downtown to see if i could find a good place to eat
we could fill a growler 1214 but not with any that we really wanted neurotic barrel octomalt james brown so we decided not to
theyve done a great job decorating the place in warm italian tones with lots of natural clean light
i am debating on the stars too
it came with a wonderful couscous as well that complimented the flavor
god even the name is terrible isnt
she offered to remake it but we were short on time and i said dont worry about it
we were up in the area so we decided to give it a try
i ordered a raspberry iced tea which was just fine for a flavored iced tea
the scent is very strong so i warn you to enter with caution
this amazing place is sushi koma
to start we both had crab fritters which were very similar to arancini and so creamy
i am only being lenient because they have an admirable business model of giving back to the community
protip you can totally ask for a side of spicy mayo
we had a great waiter cant recall his name  but he was helpful
i used to go to the burrito place next door but find the food here much tastier when i need a quick bite
i called in a short notice cupcake order and they didnt grief me about it at all
the dining room itself is nice and our server was pretty good
there used to be an employee there that greeted you in spanish as he took your order but sadly i havent seen him there in a while
i went with the crispy salt  pepper spare riblets  only 7 and mushroom agnolotti w mushroom truffle sauce
the pies have always been great
expect to wait a long time to be seated during peak hours
i would probably come back here for a sweet crepe due to the price but since i threw away most of the savory crepe i dont think i would come back for a meal
we also ordered a bottle of malbec which was perfect
great service great food
i love this bar
unless you like your burgers medium well this isnt the place for you
pros   indoor ac or lakeside alfresco dining
as far as entertainment they have no live music no bands they dont provide what most college kids want
also their cole slaw while good is not the traditional creamy slaw with sauce its more of a plain vinegar or something without any mayo type sauce
they also rotate daily lunch specials so check that out on their website
outstanding in every ways food service drinks etc
one of my absolute favorite places to go
if you are craving boba call ahead before trekking to their establishment and wasting timegasi could understand if snoh was closing soon but tonight we came at 715pm which is at least an hour and 45 before closing
but my old lady is and she says its just like being back in brooklyn
tried a sushi burrito for the first time and was happy with my choice
we literally talked about this the rest of the night
i doubt you will be disappointed
but its damn good
toppings specialty ingredients like applewood bacon and fresh guacamole and sauces
die sitzpltze sind auch hell und freundlich
couldnt even nuke it to bring it back to life
it was mouth watering and had so much flavor to it and cooked perfectly
i always want to try one of the omelets but i cant pass up corned beef so my review is based solely on the corned beef and banana bread
we dumped our food and left
the guac just didnt do it for me not at the hefty price tag of 11
although they didnt need them spreading the honey butter and housemade jam onto them made them taste that much better
laut speisekarte bieten sie zumindest tandoori gerichte an
but you have to have a bit of a irongut for wendys
its one of the reasons i keep going back
we were a party of 5 and ordered the meat lovers combo for 4 thinking that the portions would not be sufficient for us we additionally ordered 2 orders of the  chicken wings and the seafood pancake
wish they served coke products instead of pepsi but their ice tea offerings are fantastic so im not terribly bothered by this
this club was really creepy
deciding on what to order was no easy task
i cant say its the best buffet in vegas although they did they smoke salmon which was a plus
we didnt even get to do cake and sing happy birthday because by the end everyone was feeling really disappointed and tired
well be back
be aware that 16 only gets you a few pieces of fish and some shredded onions
he eventually received his water and a menu
depending on the time you go you may not find a place to sit
sushi bar is good enough but selection is limited
food nasty shrimp cook to hard rice had hard pieces salad was just lettuce and the comment we down to one chef
so far the best breakfast place in pittsburgh
my eyes light up not from excitement but because the color of this drink is so bright
all things mentioned were delicious and filling
the sting of a poorly explained happy hour special will last long after the experience of eating here
however i really wanted to like burntwood and left feeling less than impressed
we each had one i had chocolate and my friend had chocolate and rasberry
just a tip dont order extra cheese
my only complaint is that i wished they chopped the steak better
ce restaurant  remplac la grandmre poule sur la rue masson
their pancakes are usually so amazing but today they were undercooked and gooey inside
server barely checked on us it was mainly the manager
the diningroom is clean and attractive
love the house bbq sauce
so we tasted some and we were floored by the flavours bursting in the mouth
sake is an all around great dining experience
also the chantilly cake is a must try
the day i went on the last review must have been an off day because since then i have not had any issues
the dressing missed the mark
the server did let us know that their regular cook had had an emergency
having waited an hour with no food there you could have given us a rusty bumper with cheese and we would have been happy
stuffed cabbagebeef rice and no tomatoes cucumber salad with tomato and feta cheese and cordon bleubaked stuffed porkhomemade cheese and ham with sour creme along with a special homemade dipping saucebell peppers tomato garlic all hand chopped and cooked really long to make it pasty and pure
i ordered the jerk pork sliders and freshcut fries and it was so yummy
coffee was eh
it was a great area to be able to walk around talk with everyone and not be cramped
also i make sure to share a dish with someone because theres no way one person could polish off all that pasta
just moved near by and had to check this place out
food 55 service 55 environment 45 overall 455
i would go back here anytime
nice to be able to get a free combo when you check in on yelp
make sure to join the rewards club and get your free birthday burger
plus their plain rice noodle pho
after i paid my tab at the counter  as i walked away the man who tendered the transaction walked to his colleague with my receipt
i had the bbq beef and was very impressed
and when i do come back i am bringing everyone with me
about a half hour later after my wife had already eaten she returned with the scallops which appeared to have a sear on them
we waited about 30 minutes
went here twice for their late night menu that begins at 10pm
the same applebeeschilistgifriday bullshit you see everywhere else just with different scotsinspired names
once inside i was not impressed
i highly recommend naples 15
even if youre not into cocktails the drinks here are so good and so imaginative i think youll like this place anyway
i asked the waitress if they served it and she told me that she had never even heard of it
also ordered the silver noodles with chicken and shrimps yes the menu said shrimpslove the asians  asked for medium spicy and was perfect toy liking
visited blt burger on recent weekend stay to vegas
however over the past 23 months my family and i have noticed a dramatic change
then it quivered with yes i just wrote quivered on a yelp review hope that i would return
i go back to mandarin at this location for their wide selection of both asian friend noodles and rice sushi mussels with black bean sauce egg rolls spring rolls etc  and western savoury food eg
my experience was almost exactly like moniques read her review on here on 122010 only i do have to say the waitress did ask a lot of questions but i dont blame her she was only like 16 but i do blame the management for the constant questions throughout the party
one of the best places for  vegetarian food
plus this one has beer and drinks
she made a few rounds to make sure we were doing fine
none of my friends could find the place
the food is good but the service is slow
waiter was attentive and friendly
the pound of gyro meat is super cool considering its only 7
the cobbler at the bottom was disgustingly uncooked like a huge chunk of cookie dough with no sugar or tastiness
they were filling without being as rich as pork dumplings
environment 35 fun but old and needs cleaning
ich bin eigentlich kein geizhals und zahle auch gerne etwas mehr aber bei einem stolzen preis von 1250 fr einen burger
karrerhat uns berzeugt
it was absolute heaven
as for the food i cant seem to get away from the handpulled pork bbq sandwich which is excellent and nearly requires two people to eat
this place is unquestionably a bang for the buck
this restaurant is exactly what it says it is and offers those two specialties it is pretty good especially if your in the warden area where there isnt a lot of szechuan cuisine it is a small cosy family run business and as such is pretty blue collar
honestly its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude hurried shoppers all the time
we entered the restaurant hoping for a decent thai restaurant experience where our previous asian food experiences in vegas have been awfully disappointing
we are staying in an apartment in kesington market area for our 1st visit to toronto
ok i was in last night around 715sat at bartall kid there working his butt offbuttook 510 min to get our orderanother 510 to get my  draft beer some curly haired girl w a kid on left end of barsome kind of former employeeevery other employee in the place visiting w her the entire time she was therei mean 45 people standing around doing nothing while i cannot get servicewaiting on everythingplace not that busywinding down10 min to put dback game on too now the foodnow in full disclosure i am former deli counternmanbut i always come in and ask for 12 patrami w swiss and please shave it so i can bite thru itlast night they give me huge half sandbread always crusty cause sitting under light waiting on pickuppastrami not shavedbottom is an inch of hash and junk off sliceri know the gamegood and bad in the pilebut really not very good i dont know who does the deli slicing but i promise you they  are cluelesscb needs to be cut against graini dont even bother ordering that anymorebut its hard to screw up pastramibut they usually doevery 5th time its rightget these hacks some training or use some qc in what goes out on platesmy two cents
we were excited to eat here because of the name
staff would argue about the mistakes in front of us
went for breakfast the other sunday and it was delicious
atmosphere very dark inside
you also have chicken beef salmon cutlet ramen udon maki rolls hand rolls nigiri pieces and so on
my sister and i ate here  shared a salad and the chicken and waffles  so good
my wife and i enjoy his place regularly
beautiful cakes taste as good as they look
im certain we will return again
even when i got to the plaza it was a little hard to find the english name was really tiny on their sign and we circled around the parking lot twice before we realized where it was
everything was presented so beautifully  it made you almost not want to eat it
all in all a fantastic evening and i will definitely be back again
youll want more so ask for more right away
so the wife and i had a loooooong night and needed some nice greasy food to fix is up
a decent option for breakfast especially since its the only choice on this side of the resort other than subway
this hands down is the best that i have had
that is not the case at splendido
they make some of the best margaritas around
service was quick and responsive
everything was delicious
lasagna was cold in the middle sent it back they put it in the microwave and gave it back like a soup pretty gross
the omelets are small
loves the foie gras brle and the scallops
live alone only based one drink
for the price of a couple of entrees two of you can share up to 7 or 8 different items in the lounge
the price was the same as everywhere and the actually plate wasnt lovely nor was it delectable
we ended up going down the street to 3 speed for a drink and i regretted not just eating there since the environment was a thousand times more inviting
pork was almost not edible it was so dry
the best part of this pub is that the locals are customers
i got to steal a bite and it was not your usual dry chicken breast
fish is not the freshest and pricing is on par with places that have better quality
ive never tried a meat option there but ever vegetarian thing ive had there has been great
the food is made to order and everything is fresh
its definitely on the more affordable end of the squirrel hill coffee shops and is much quieter than either of the starbucks or the centerofthegradschooluniverse commonplace coffee so it has that going for it
its great for those of us who like to try different things each time though
avoid the line with the express pass service can be rather slow but dont worry just flag them down
we all ordered several options for the appetizers and were so happy with the multiple vegetarian selections that were provided
plenty of servers walking around ignoring us avoiding eye contact etc
first time at a sushi burrito place
theres not that much that they change from lunch and dinner besides the big stuff like crab legs and roast beef but the price is like 12 more for dinner
the eggs bene were perfect
we went late on a wednesday night and the place was empty
i wish it had come with some pico de gallo or something for some extra heat
dressing croutons chopped lettuce with parmesan cheese on top
and probably go back again to eat
boy that was disappointing
no one could stop eating the fresh made chips  guac
the salad bar was decent and i wished i had focused on that
i ate so much of it and was so sad i could not take the rest with me hotel living has some drawbacks
sorry to be mrscrooge on a christmas day
great deal wide range of items and surprisingly a lot of food
ultimately im torn between liking and disliking the villa unit
i found this funny
service was on top of our drinks music was great bathrooms were clean seeing how many people were there and if you want some r  r they have a big patio or a smaller bar in the games area
better than most chain pizza
this is a lovely place to have a coffee italian soda or a meal
the have some really excellent meat dishes as wellthe tandoori chicken is marinated wonderfully
service was very good and the owner is quite nice as we spoke to her for a while
for dessert you can order a smore pie that is delicious and melts in your mouth
anyways back to the main event  seems like at the hour we went everything was out  no black sesame no swiss roll cakes and we were basically left with the short end of the stick
having said that i understand that this place is primarily known for their buffet which ill have to return to try ill update ifwhen i do
i had the nicoise salad 2000 hardly any toppings or tuna served with this pathetic buckwheat pancake on top
the grilled teriyaki steak he ordered was ok doused in sauce but ultimately cooked ok if slightly overdone
still no burrito
archies is pretty much a staple in my places to eat
we usually sit at the bar and jason is more often than not our bartender
good food cooked perfectly with a service
i think most of it was good because it was piping hot at the time the leftover pad thai tasted bland and left much to be desired the next day when i packed it for lunch
my friend and i decided to split a mr fungi pizza
after going here and trying it out for myself id have to defer for both the quality of food and service
i dont know why it was so loud
they offer both a japanesesushi menu and a korean menu
so my boyfriend and i made the long trek from the city center to the fashion show mall solely for the opportunity to get delicious cupcake from red velvet
the star of the show however was my wifes pastrami style short rib
we walked in saturday morning
food was great and came out super fast
so for what its worth
some things have changed
service sucked ass big time
the sandwich prices seem reasonable 58 until you realize there are no sides included  luckily there is a menu of sides to choose from greens rosti bacon etc
the only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but dont let that stop you
i did not think this place could compare by looking at the outside but i surely was wrong
lots of meat in those claws and we ordered the large not the jumbo
jeeeeez this place is garbagehow does it take 20minutes to care of 3 cars in a drive thruso bad never coming back
thank you for that tip fellow yelper
very fresh and bold with real cream
i needed to grab a quick bite to eat after a long bike ride with my daughter so i decided to finally try get some burritos
my favorite was the dancing tiger roll
wow  just noticed the last time i reviewed this place was in 2008
waitresses were attentive 6 waitresses in a smaller sized restaurant sashimi was good rolls were good soft shell crab was excellent
maybe give it 35  good but not great
i got a chicken sandwich and my partner got the tremont burger
no real flavour to the beef unfortunately
it was fairly crowded and we were seated at a table upstairs
the owner is really nice though so i want them to succeed  but without having lower prices its gonna be tough
once you reach the old outpost its a slight hilly drive down a 2 lane road to get to the little train station parking
but definitely very good
dinner prices are about average
the ambiance is pubbish with stained wooden floors and walls head stones mirrors marble pillars and dim chandeliers
das finde ich echt erstaunlich weil das restaurant gerade abends und an sommertagen sehr gut besucht ist
as for food definitely get the spicy garlic edamame
i got the tonkotsu ramen with traditional toppings and egg
plus the pizza chefs are back there making everything from scratch so you know it takes time
first impressions are lasting impressions
nigiri portions are generous with thickcut large pieces
service started off great then went downhill a bit
the art itself isnt a big deal to me but to do art like that you need good foam  so good art is a sign of good foam
nothing is made by these guys
there are about eight tvs
its one of the few places you can sit outside just a few feet away from the strip sidewalk and all the peoplewatching that affords
throughout our evening our service was spectacular
i think they can in some part
i was so hyped up about this place but the experience didnt live up to it
i loved the rosemary on the fries and the generousness of the yolk mixture in the eggs fork and knife were essential for me and my clumsiness
comfortable large tables
we have been pleasantly surprised at the quality flavor decor  cleanliness
i actually just ate there two weekends ago
the first 2 times were higher than the 2star marks for sure
very inexpensive but amazing food
all in all el encanto is a good enough place to go when in cave creek and in need of some americanized mexican food
excellent all around
now when i order super extra crispy hash browns from other places theyre either burnt and still slimy on the inside or just cooked normal
i love this place
but it is fun and they offer coupons
youre quickly climbing the ranks as my favorite vegas restaurant
service is great
when leaving the restaurant one of the kitchen staff was outside at the door on his cell phone smoking
while a handful were good most were room temperature
i had the benedict and my husband had the chilaquiles
todays experience was horrible they took almost an hour for my food to come out not happy at all the service was not the best either
prohibition also does 5 drink specials between 6pm7pm
we tried to get in on 3 mondays between noon  1 pm but the doors arent open no hours posted no info on the website  no message on the phone deliveries were being accepted at the back door
i stopped here to grab a quick bite on my way to the toronto yelp event at eds real scoop thinking that the ice cream would be the highlight of my evening
first time i ordered a hot pastrami sandwich and i wasnt very impressed based on the pricesandwich ratio
table clean and sturdy
i had the california omelet which was delicious
my companion ordered the moo goo gai pan
it was rumored that when this bakerycafe reopened under the fresh moniker that they would have extended hours an expanded more diverse menu and the addition of beer and wine
it was not organized and not easy to understand
the cocktails were top notch and the food was delicious
another great one is the purple haze the pizza that taught me the miracle of roasted kale
the mango curry dish was great
voir photo cidessous
will definitely go back for the pizza sometime but maybe go somewhere else for drinks
as good as it gets
we came at exactly 4pm in the middle of the week so there werent that many people there
this place was amazing everything was very fresh and it had a nice cozy atmosphere
could a few things be improved on
its a warm and friendly place to be with multiple tvs blaring the current football game patrons and fans cheering with every touchdown and piping hot pizza right from the oven
pretty decent flavors in most dishes except for the tom yum koong which was just all lime and chili with very faint lime leaf taste and no real garlic sugar nor lemongrass flavors
it was a challenge eating even half of it so i had to bring it to go
tried to have dinner here with the family so we went into what would be considered the family dining area since we obviously couldnt go into the bar section with our kids
and i mean never
but the atmosphere  service  ambiance and food are something that everyone should try once in this existence we call life
i may not ever eat shrimp again because of this place
such a nice upscale twist on classic wisconsin food
love the locker room
somehow it was slower than many onemanned shops ive been to and the croissant was soggy and slimey
250 each is steep too but whatever they really are just that good
the food was above average as well
loved the food here went for the first time about a month ago and went back again about 2 weeks ago
both were fresh and very tasty
he offers to make me anything i want but im too pissed off right now to do anything about it
soups won ton hot and sour and egg drop are really tasty
great sushi restaurant
really cool open space with high ceilings
for the specials you could have fed 4 instead of 2
yes the staff can be a little abrupt but they mean well
if you are looking for an outdoor relaxed atmpshere with good dishes and even better brew check this place out
i have no complaints at all about the food it was all delicious
fake oily whipped cream not real cream
i ordered an 18 pep  honey bbq wings and garlic knots
fried chicken was not bad but i couldnt but think that it was in the fryer just a tad bit long street parking can be challenging at times
he allowed himself the business man special
i had a tuna roll rather plain and uninspired but the roll with salmon skin and bonito flakes on top was awesome
great place great staff great place
and i recommend the limit 2 margaritas
we had to been been shrimp calamari and bitesize crabcakes
gets very busy on weekends so be prepared to wait to be seated
try the benedict
how sweet is that
customer service ended up being ok i would come back if i dont feel like getting down
downsides are the film selection and parking layout
but if i have to wait 25min for you to take my order
we came here twice
the ambiance was on point
i would never recommend this this place
same price but the experience will be 100x better
knowing what congestion lay ahead of us
i had been there 2 times before but none of the others in my group had been there before
sourdough or a parisien both are larger and last at least an extra day in my house
since its down the street from my office i usually make my way to this cafe in the morning or in the afternoon for a quick bite
we both had salads
you place your order and pay choose a table and they bring the food out to you
they will have gaming machines so it will be open 24 hrs and will be a smoking place
this place has potential due to its location but management needs to take a marketing class and a hustling bartender at least needs to be pretty
it can get loud in there
prob would not dine here again bc its quite boring to eat at a small placehowever if you do enjoy the intimate candle light small table dinner this is a place for you
i will definitely be coming back
but nice delivery guy and it also took less time than the estimate given
owners jacob whartonshukster and jonathon poon affectionately known as johnny make up the dream team behind chantecler
how very kind
the servers werent particularly attentive which was supremely odd because the bargrill area was pretty empty on a thursday night
i will give 2 stars because it is a fun atmosphere for the kids but that is about it
the pork belly appetizer was tough and mushy not alot of flavor
worth to try
i also put almonds mochi and cheesecake bites
they were the diameter of swiss chalet fries but longer in length
we were given water and i continued to look over the menu and the food did sound good
the customer service is exceptional
perfect for dipping warm buttered toast in
oh and i did like the fact that when you get delivery and use card they bring the card reader with them rather than giving my card number over the phone
you must try the chips
i have been the token metal head to the original lolos for many years
i love this place i dont go as often as i should but every time i do i am never disappointed
my friends and i were seated in a corner right next to the kitchen area
the staff went above and beyond in preparing a glutenfree entree of the pecanencrusted mahithen overcooked it to the point of being dry and tough
go in and ask the server for their suggestions and go for it
the burrito was double wrapped with 1 huge tortillas
the samosas were fresh made and light the breading not too heavy as can happen
love the potted bread
only thing i would do different is maybe some lunch specials and no styrofoam containers for left overs
we will definitely go back here on our trip next year
he had the miso hungry ramen with a bit of sesame oil
fantastic night out with the ladies
well they stuck witht the name teriyaki madness and gave unlimited sauce for all
the sandwich was pretty good could have used something to add flavor or spice but i would get it again
if you have tried this location before but have not been lately give it another chance
we went to mimis in goodyear on october 25th
i was hurting for something greasy to calm my inebriated self
you wont regret it
we didnt actually eat here due a number of issues
many places do this  make things hotter for asians even if you order the same spice level
since it was happy hour we tried the greek meatballs greek fries and introduced my friend to the hummusagain plenty of food probably could have done with out the appetizers but hey they were happy hour prices
he was enthusiastic and attentive and our sparkling water glasses never fell lower than half full yes im an optimist
i like their kakigori
the food was beautiful and delicious the service was professional and personable at the same time
great job patrick
the wait staff was perfect especially jake who took care of us like we were very special people
its a great local place to have a saki bombers and happy hour
not to say that i didnt enjoy the meal  the meal indeed satisfied my pho cravings and i left full and without regret
service the lady who works behind the counter was friendly
i arrived early i was totally ignored by 2 girls at the register
i frequently elect to take out my food as i live around the corner but the restaurant is very nice for eating in as well
their eggs were done perfectly ramen noodles were chewy and the broth was delicious
the situation was different when brazen head was the only spot in liberty village but now there are loads more pubs and restaurants to choose from
lettuce wraps remain a fave
the burger turned out to be over cooked and the bun was dry and crumbly
it looks expensive
try the chi chi roll
you can definitely taste the ginger
portion sizes were good and didnt give that overstuffed feeling but filling
taco bell is well taco bell
benicio del porko is one of the best things i have ever eaten
great food and service
downstairs from the main lobby
i guess its not too bad for a restaurant that would have something for everyone ill probably come back here again seeing as our team doesnt play too far from here
the cousin and i spent the day at the spa then stumbled blissed out in search of carbs
food is always delicious
the fried chicken was a bit disappointing
their menu is a bit more refined with only a handful of items in each category but i think thats a testament to how much they care about the food they are putting out
tt was our first meal in vegas after checking in to the luxor
if you are a big spender and want to pay extra for snobby service then by all means this is your place
on the other hand a number of hot dishes were very good and i had a nice dinner after i figured out which things were fit to eat
it was the bomb of a burger
you are getting your moneys worth with the food
the wrap is a slice of sweet daikon accompanied by super tender octopus and pork with a light crisp coating
theres the typical italian chinese mexican and american stations
suggestion your drink choice should be the root beer
4 grottos famous peach bellini was perfect
i would go back but stick to wings and pasta
i think the menu changed because it didnt seem familiar to us at all
as far as the delicious sweets go they have a little of everything for varying palettes
sono stata in questo pub un paio di settimane fabellissimo linternoda quel che ho visto un ampia selezione di birrepurtroppo io nn bevo birra e il cibo tradizionalebehdavvero ottimoservizio cortese e attentounica pecca x essere un pub  un pochino caroma pu anche starci una volta ogni tanto
just keep in mind that they close at 8pm so plan to go there for an early dinner
i would have given 5 stars in a second but was upset i paid for 2 hours of bottomless drinks at 843pm and was told after 1 drink at 940 the bar was closing at 10pm
i always leave satisfied
also love the ocean salad
if you go to a tapas place and expect you can order one dish and serve 4 people with it then you cant fault the restaurant
i got an email from a robbie turner area supervisor that thanked me for my time
they kept emphasizing that their pasta is house made
first off so impressed that they have a vegetarian menu item thats not some lame pasta
this place was average
great job guys
stick to harkins
we went on all you can eat wing night so the place was busy but we thought that the service was still good
great food for the price
delicious succulent crab meat it is
the restaurant itself was very nice dated but nice
im a chicago boy
it was seriously lacking in flavor and very greasy
we made out reservation with plenty of time to dine before the show and we couldnt fully enjoy the dining experience because our waiter although nice took long to ask us what we wanted
i showed her the menu that comes with drink she looked over to the other person said something in there language
otherwise cheers to anyone that has rocky raccoon on the jukebox
would never recommend youre better of at tim hortons and im not even the biggest fan
the mamas spinach thin crust pizza is awesome
jackbeagles has hands down some of the best mac n cheese ive ever eaten and ive eaten a lot of mac n cheese
i was expecting to get onion rings  wing sauce on the side to dip in but they had run out of onion rings by the time i got there  i had deep fried pickles  nachos instead
he said it tasted similar
i specifically left 0 tip on the bill to make a statement and they have the nerve to charge me a tip
he got us a dessert on the house thank you
the staff is friendly and attentive and they provided excellent service
i really like pholicious
der erste eindruck ist gut die begrssung kurz und knapp
it wasnt worth what we paid
i wont be begging to go back anytime soon
thats fine but a sign near the door stating please wait to be seated would solve about 99 of the hostess running around and rearranging people and 100 of the confusion for first time visitors
i think ive only seen the same person twice
and what i got was 2 sausage links on both ends of the hero
the selection is limited but when its forte is chinese beef noodles in a clear broth who needs anything else
i wanted to give michael mina the benefit of the doubt
in the sandwich and the sliders i could tell the meat was decent
the food order chicken kababs mediocre and overcooked with salad horrible wash the onions and hummus cold like out of the refrigerator cold
i dont know who these guys are trying to kid but this is not authentic italian
agree with one of the reviews below me
the dessert was the perfect way to end the mealit was a tiny but flavorpacked lemon tart with a dollop of frozen greek yogurt
ive had chinese at other places where they have right amounts of salt n chilli
they dont clean the rooms at all based on the huge blood stain we found on the bed
the crust of the pie was perfectly buttery flavoured and texture was nice flaky
the toppings were actually quite delicious but the bread tasted as though they picked it up from frys a few days ago
otherwise i would recommend going to another buffet because there are plenty options that are preferable over bistro buffet
the ambiance is comfortablethey have an open wall out to the outside and tables throughout
didnt even eat
ive come here twice on my lunch break and been late back both times so that wont happen again
there is no option to switch it out with house fried rice or lomien for a couple extra bucks
it is a beautiful place
i waited 10 minutes before my waitress came to the table to take my drink order
and the coffee
i would definitely order it again
i would see myself coming back and still getting my tea without boba
some of the oysters had fallen into the watery puddle and it did not look appetizing at all
didnt try the poutine because coming to a belgian restaurant for poutine just didnt seem right
she was kind and said start with a frosting and topping or pick from the display case
the chicken enchiladas are also very tasty
being busy is a great problem to have but happy this was remedied to make it even easier to get our fix
the ambiance is modern without being too cold just dont expect to have a puffy old chair to cozy up in with a book
ordered drinks and apps all came out fast and amazing as always
fries are incredible
stepping in this place had that dive seedy feel to it
on the side with the bar the service is amazing
i didnt mind the seating arrangement that other people here are complaining about
the inside is pretty small i think only 8 tables 2 of which only seat 2 the staff is friendly and really polite but when busy can sometimes use a reminder to refill your glass
we took our chances with southwest diner
the laser lights are really cool and some guy comes out and starts shooting water vapor at you to cool you off
i gave them 2 stars because i received a free glaze donut for the wait time but this location needs to get it together
made sure our water jug was never empty
grilled romaine was very good
i never thought that id find a great eatery hidden in the strip mall of the new condo development near my place in middleton but the prairie cafe is a rare find
it smothers some of the flavors they should be accentuating
probably will be the last time we order them
the food is standard pub fare burgers sandwiches salads etc
grubhub gave me a 6070 minute delivery time
the bruschetta wasnt that impressive but it was only 1 cmon people
big thanks to chef jk for recommending this place to me months ago even though id had it bookmarked for years
worst rare beef pho ever
you wont regret it
they add the cheese before warming it up in the oven so no old sloppy cheese here
i asked her if she could put the birthday card on the table before we arrived and she said sure
but it was the worth it because the beignets are bomb
the salmon poke bowl was excellent and beautifully presented
warning  dont wear white
overall though my breakfast sandwich was pretty delicious
so on my last visit i decided to do just that
overall go for hookah go elsewhere for food
the food has not kept up with what i remember although it isnt bad by any means
this might seem cool or trendy to some but its not my personal preference
i had the crappy tire and loooved having pineapple on a burger
save yourself the disappointment and eat at home
she told us that we should be fine not too reassuring they should really make sure their staff has better training to meet the needs of people with dietary restrictions
overall ive had some great times here including winning a wisconsin shaped point beer raft in a raffle when partaking of cheap pitchers of beer on a wednesday night
i visit this restaurant about 4 times a year
trust me there are much better british places to eat
i had a couple of their signature mixed drinks very nice
thankfully phil said yes  and was beyond helpful with helping me plan the event and make it successful
i definitely will come back to try different shaved ice flavors and their beverageslike the caramel apple latte or the lychee iced tea
the lady who took our order had very short hair
very knowledgable staff and awesome drinks
i will come back soon because im guessing there are some real winners on the menu
we argued about the amount left in the bowl and that i did not consume half the bowl as the bowl was not full when served to me
overall i dont think their drinks are anything to die for and i usually just get wine
the chow fun was good but forgettable the pork was also tasty
we then ordered steaks as our entree
came in for lunch on a tuesday
had to wait awhile before the waitress brought me syrup
note this is vpn ie
before moving to my home just hours away from the mexican border there was luchitas
they were so smoky and salty and just made my taste buds dance
i great place to eat and entertain in belmont
rules are rules but be courteous and friendly while delivering them and maybe make sure everyone has ordered before you start barking them out
i will be back soon
excellent value and excellent food experience
we had the beef wellington for two and it was the perfect amount of food
however this is a solid choice and i may make a stop to the dining room before my trip is over
as you walk in the door you are greeted by good looking girls in skimpy nurses outfits
went to burgatory for the first time last week when my mom came to visit and my burger was delicious
try to go during the week and during the evening to beat the long line
the crispy duck is the duck is the way to go but you cannot go wrong with anything here
the food is good but the prices vs portion size is not right
it became rather annoying
beer selection is from the capital brewery
it was as if it was microwaved cold
once i got the waitress attention because she always on the move i asked for more alfredo sauce
i love thai food but cant always find one that doesnt cater to the phalang think gringo for thailand
in addition the baguette needs to be more crispy and crunchy  in order to make it more vietnam like
its a deep fried sort of sushi roll but on one side it has a deep fried cap of sorts to contain the crab and mushroom together
peppercorn bacon cheddar burger for myself with garlic fries
and the noodles
i think i just used the same description as richard b
i had the beef brisket noodle soup which is usually what i order in the richmond hill branch as well
the delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes
the food i am ironically thankful for the fact that the onions were left on my salad
the guacamole was fresh  flavorful and a generous serving size
cheese was hard to just dip out you have to use your fork or knife or risk stringing it all over the table
or hash hash a no go
this time however the place was jam packedboth inside and out
food was awesome
its really disheartening but i didnt dock points for that because whatever im just one person and thats my specific need
we decide to both order the spicy roll set because everybody was raving about it
32 for 2 people  45 stars chicken and waffles  yummm brown sugar and banana flapjack arnold palmers x 2 why 1 star
love this place just 1 bad experience last weekend with one of the new bouncers
one gentleman came by to get our drink order because our waiter was at another table
seemed like a bad fast food restaurant
the waiter ended up getting our drinks wrong
had a brief discussion and educated the manager on service dog lawsseems they never encountered a service dog before
she didnt even hand us the food she just pointed to the food on the counter and said its over there
had a green chili angus burger which was very dry and a side of green chili mac and cheese which was nothing special
on first impression i was amazed by their beer list  it was longer than most in cleveland
if you want hard liquor this is the place
appropriate for the name
thank you bandito for a wonderful evening out
cooked how perfectly and the veggies reminded me of how my nonna makes them
the revamped concept and menu seem to bring more clientele into the space
i had looked up the menu on there website so i had an idea of the menu
our server was attentive and pleasant
fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas
i called ahead for seating and everything was ready when we got there
the pizza is the best you can find her in vegas but all of the other food is just as good
my fianc had the turkey club and she was not impressed either
groupon brought us here
our waiter was rich he was very upbeat and had a good energy about him
weve been there several times recently and it is becoming a favorite
overall perhaps a bit pricey for a causal night out but for a special night and different type of dining experience its absolutely worth it
and i had to totally agree
my stomach is blind and loves all foods
after a conversation i was allowed to order the blackened shrimp appetizer and it was outstanding
it was a red velvet cake with a berry sauce on the side and white chocolate shavings
i like the beer selection here its served ice cold  there lemonade is screaming good
the herby fetatomato topping was a tasty touch
i say food experience because the ambiance was fantastic and the service was great hence two stars instead of one but the food was simply terrible
highly recommended and we will be back for sure
the best part is its central location in toronto
it was very clean and well put together
well tucked away in park road shopping center is this older charlotte restaurant
knowing that my father appreciates southwestern spices and flavors i knew it was going to be an adventure for both of us
ive been to this red robin a few times and went again tonight and i can honestly say that ive never had a bad experience there
this time i had the smokeshack which was a bacon cheeseburger topped with cherry peppers
there is way too much rice in the bento  4 stars
we had steamed dumplings to start then sizzling scallops in black bean sauce and whole rosy roasted duck
the service was slow and the restaurant was only slightly busy at noon  meaning there were empty tables
run by a family everyone here is fun and friendly
there were seriously only 3 or 4 desserts on the menu which didnt sound too appealing to me
i say 8 is a good value because ive been to self proclaimed martini bars servingem up at 1215 a pop
i would highly recommend the reserve inn if you are in the hudson area
we were so dissapointed 4 girls 2 rolls 4 drinks 2 miso soup 1 edamame sp
grab the cheddar bacon muffin its literally heaven
service was great
it just melts away in your mouth
les portions sont bonnes et les plats sont savoureux
three of us went and i have to say im really glad we did
of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome
wanted to catch up on some college football games
we were so amazed at how good the food was we were planning our return before we left
if people like the historical significance of this place maybe it should be converted into a museum
2 order the wagyu ribeye and split it with another person if need be
from arrival to departure 75 minutes for ordering 2 burgers to getting bill
the same dude walks up and writes on a piece of paper 538 shoves it towards me and walks off again
masa sushi never disappoints
the service here was good
it got better from there
out here in phoenixmetro
the bathroom was super not clean
decided to try this place because it was conveniently located since we were staying in the planet hollywood casino formerly aladdin casino and they gave guests a 5 coupon off per person to encourage ppl to try it
when asked for recommendations they were able to quickly provide both the most popular and personal favorite with a detailed description going beyond the menu that clearly showed some personal experience with the dishes
for me it felt like it interfered with the taste a little bit
this restaurant has probably the most thickest cut and delicious variety of sashimi ive ever tried
the service is incredibly pretentious
what i particularly like is that there are pretty distinct differences across the options so if you are a group and ordered a few different options you get to enjoy the variety
overall the service was nice the food was ok or at least mine was for the price i also expect more than some chicken and bean sprouts and an egg
when all is said and done you get a very good japanese meal at a relatively high price
servers were friendly and accommodated our needs
the al fresco pizza was divine
prices are what you would expect for the food and area
and the hubbs got a veggie khorma at a level 7also supper hot
pervs the menu is simple burgers and burgers
about 10 minutes later our real server came and since we were already taken care of by the other girl i felt like it shouldve just been her who received this table as hers and receive the tips but anyhow our server wasnt as interactive as i thought she would be reason for saying this is because if you want good tip just bullshit something or say something and chill a little bit whistle while you work she checked up on us about 35 times about how we were doing and just awkwardly but quickly left after saying anything to us
he was fast with recommendations as well
their fries were good
oh you vegans can stay away
our dish did not resemble the promo photo at all
the server was courteous and helpful
the purpose of a drivethrough is to provide fast service to people on the go
maggianos has always been a family favorite
the apps were decentnothing amazing but definitely a nice to have
well be coming back
my only compliant is the smoking its really bad during games  but other times its tolerable
on a positive note i talked to the manager and he brought me a box of shrimp to go and the bartender bought me a beer
the ambience the decor the food
no hassle and the parking deck rocks when its raining
quality ingredients and a knowledgeable staff who will properly advise their cliental will win over customers
oh and dont even get me started about the one time we showed up and had to wait over 20 min
update ventilation problem has been solved as they have expanded so its not as enclosed
we were able to use a restaurantcom coupon with zero issue
otherwise we truly love arrowhead grill
there is always a wait for a table here
the lentil soup is the best i have had
hubby got the pg breakfast burritoyum
just placed on top of it
i felt like chuck bass
i am really mad and tired with thier ignoranc already
the service is great
patio seating is available when weather is appropriate and the setting and view are gorgeous
my boyfriend and i ordered our drinks but quickly realized the ac was not working and it was about 35 degrees inside5 mins later we were sweating but decided to stay and order  food anyway since we had heard good things
not very customer service oriented
if im in town again i would definitely visit this restaurant again
they dont take reservations so you want to get there early
i made a reservation in advance they placed us on the side bench with tables and chairs uncomfortably pushed together
however most people seemed to order sandwiches when i was there
beers here are also very cheap
crust was superb atmosphere was tremendous
yep i see the reviewer before me used the phrase hidden gem
for what it costs this isnt a good bang for your buck
the cinnamon sugar strips were very tasty and simple
ordered the hummus and taboule for appetizer which were delicious but i wasnt really into the taboule which makes me feel like you have to have an acquired taste for it
overall food was fine ambiance was nice  however i wouldnt consider this a great dining experience and would likely never return given how many options there are in vegas
i had the grilled vegetable salad
the service was great
welcome lou dawgs
and on my other sons forks
was not prepared table side like other highend restaurants do
mussels in chorizo sauce was beyond major
still no one came
i also order a bloody mary oyster shot  it was okay could barely taste the vodka and the oyster was meh
overall average chinese food
food was good like the concept but nothing that wowed me
thankfully the service as of late has been pretty awesomethere soft drinks are absolutely amazing and sometimes i go just for that
everything seems to taste the same
floats shakes sundaes malts sodas egg creams and phosphates
it is locating the the charlotte plaza building near the starbucks
the collards  i loved  normally i put vinegar on mine  but i dont feel la wans needed it  they were cooked just right with the right amount of flavor
the last time i had thai tea flavored ice cream was in sf and they got rid of itso i have been on the hunt for something like thisand it ends up being in wicked spoon
we made reservations in advance for a friday
i come here every so often with my mom to catch up and always grab a seat at the bar where the bartender jackson takes great care of us
they are also all wearing said eyeliner
the dessert was great too baklava was greatnot too sweet and their peanut butter chocolate cake wasnt too dense but rather fluffy
ordered take out asked if they had veggie fried rice as i didnt have a menu
small cozy booths and seating
was the order not put in
best wings around in my opinion
the biscotti was perfect with the coffee the quiche in the other hand was good just had too much nutmeg and was way over priced at 775
it was excellent they actually grilled up the veggies and the tortilla giving it the nice crunch of a taco without the frying
the servers are very nice and they refill my drinks promptly
she let us know that it would only be a bit longer and that they knew where we were sitting at the bar and would come fetch our party when our table was ready
by 1230pm when we left the place was packed i only saw asian faces and heard only cantonese conversations  though given the menus are also english i dont think not knowing cantonese would be an impediment
our server suggested the charred cauliflower to share and were so happy she did because the presentation alone was phenomenal
i wont frequent this facility again
it was excellent as were the stuffed peppers and fried mozzarella appetizers
im a regular lunch diner
this place a refreshing reminder of how good indian food is
the sound in the bar is a bit off balance but the grapevine offers a fun time
cafe republique is a typical diner but with some deficiencies
the food is awesome
however the menu does need a facelift
all in all downright good honest food and a lovely night out
during my most recent visit to vegas i got to do so but the steakhouse is now a ruths chris
the best hakka food anywhere at a very reasonable price
a little disappointed with gameworks
i am not a picky eater by any means but  the pizza here sucks
the pork was outstanding and the arepa was hands down the best arepa i ever had
they also offer bottomless mimosas for 22
the last time i went there was a decent wait outside with the other two dozen people attempting to have lunch  this time was better because it was late lunch  my favorite time anyway
there was no wow factor and with those prices i cant justify more than a slightly above average 35 star review
i also think they were like that because it opened very recently so they are still getting into the routine
smoked meatloaf sounds awesome and the burgers looked great too
i wasnt expecting such a large amount of veggies with garlic chicken
i was not disappointed
which cost 325 regularly
additional toppings range from 050 to an extra dollar
i did try my mothers pasta and that sauce was the same really bad
madisonians are picky about brunch  and clearly they dont know that bonfyre has brunch from 102 on sundays
she was doing her jib well but at 5 pm and 40 minutes to get a drink she needed help
the chicken breasts were tender and juicy
each and every thing we ordered had great flavour and was amazing
pbj sliders the dish i was most excited about and the only one i was underwhelmed by
then our drinks were done and we wondered where our food was
quick everything tastes fresh
the bread however did hit the mark
the wait staff are quite friendly
the steak melts in your mouth
the soup du jour will probably change but order a bowl of whatever it is
as we were winding down the bartender showed back up with patis rum cake  his favorite so he told us
my main course was the sonoma chicken but my group had a variety of things so i tried a little bit of everything
great neighborhood with more than decent bar food cold drinks on a nice patio and casual friendly people
i will be back on my next las vegas trip
however the 3 star is not about the flavor its for the poor customer service
i want to love zos kitchen
in a city with limited beer options great lakes stands out
new yorker deli is misleading as this definitely did not feel like a sandwich from the bronx
i was very disappointed
we called in a takeout order for 12 chicken dinner beef kabob dinner 2 orders of falafel and a large baba ganoosh
they were very slow and understaffed got one of our orders wrong and completely neglected our request for coffee
if you feel you must go to gordon ramsay steak just order the sides
here is a classic 1970s pizza place that understands that you need great ingredients to make a great pie
i kept the vegetable and lamp and substituted the polenta for a side of their homemade tagliolini pasta this looks sort of like fettucini
they are to die for really they are that good
great breakfast choice
several times i tried to start a conversation and he ignored me
great place and will be back time and time again
and while we are lovers of a great steak and a good bottle of cab which this place also offers we werent disappointed in our decision to go with the burger
the atmosphere was simple but cool
is a must for all of my east coast friends to go to innout when they visit
it was 695 and i received the traditional thai start soup which is seasoned broth with scallions and herbs
the new crispy chicken is good but only for a limited time
will definitely be back
gordon ramsay fish  chips was the lone disappointing meal of my trip
food was amazing but paired with the wonderful customer service made it a place we wont quick forget
they only opened yesterday but it felt like they were already opened for quite a while
this was to be my first dinner in the new lair
the service was outstanding
id increase the price range to  though
very friendly made great recommendations and kept our drinks topped off
oui lendroit semble happening de lextrieur  oui le dcor  lintrieur est topdesign  oui tout le monde nen dit que du bien mais moi le saloon ma laisse plus quindiffrente
the service was excellent and the food was too
i understand this situation being a former food service employee
they are very attentive and friendly
one thing to keep in mind with regards to eating here there is always a line up and you will have to patience to get a good seat
it had a bit of a sour taste which offset the sweetness
great place to go and meet new people
one of the best italian restaurants ive been to
solid burger joint
the fresh squeezed sweet orange juice was mouth watering fantastic
55 bucks for all you can eat high quality food and free mimosas most of the time is great
the toilet took a while to flush the iron was busted and broken the ceiling walls were peeling the shower did not have a shower mat the room did not even have a chair for the desk or a small couch inside even though there was room for one
coffee  meh
this place is great for getting brinner breakfast for dinner
it is so unbelievably underrated the food is great maybe second only to khao san road out of all i have had in the city
her the white meat me the tenders
octopus is ok its impressive in its presentation and the fregola is yummy though the octopus could be more tender and salted  and perhaps exhibit some of that chargrilled taste so evident in the awesome steak
is this as good no but if you are in vegas it is an adequate substitute
2800 for 2 bites
afterwards we strolled along the street towards louis square which had really interesting architecture all around great evening
the person who took our order was very nice
she ordered a vodka tonic and couldnt even drink it because it tasted medicinal and bitter
overall it was a very disturbing experience and if i could give them no stars i would
cool to see
by the time i got my order the rest of the party was done eating
im not sure why anyone would give the 5th ave cafe less than 5 stars
i usually dont love a lot of fruit on my salad but these fruits go really really well with their vinaigrette
i picked a drink off the cocktail list and waited and waited and waited for a server to bring water or say hello or anything
wow this place was great
do try the wings and the hot pretzel
theres also room for groups
it was awesomethen i was super excited for the peach cobbler and the owner said there was only tomato cobbleri was like wtf
ich mag den laden und werde mal abends vorbeischauen
we were all trying to figure out what the other herb in it was  and they told us star anise
we ate pub pretzel  good shrimp  grits  very blah didnt finish it
the new york steamer
nice people  prices great love the salsa bar very clean plenty of parking even for a big truck green chili burrito kicks ass
for dessert i wanted to try the tiramisu just to compare to the ones we love in north beach sf but the waitress suggested that we try the crochettes instead
and these ppl want 15hr
some options for sushi apps and stone pot dishes
i absolutely love innout
i am a vegetarian and appreciated the veggie section of the menu
great place to go if you like big portions lots of flavor and to be loud  to enjoy yourself without feeling out of place
you can also make it a bowl or nachos
better than ihop by far
i totally forbid eating red meat at home so when we dine out i dont make a fuss if thats what he chooses
the place isnt all that expensive in fact it seems pretty lowend but the food i got was quite good for the price and i consider it a great value
i dont care how the food might be from this place
i wasnt a huge fan of the white bun as i found it a bit dense but this is a minor criticism
the menu warns it takes 35 minutes to make and it did
exceptional service and food
ate here twice with friends
how do you have a job as a bar tender
the ambiance is wonderful when the weather is perfect
the host is doing everything but attending to us
we looked over the menu the usuals i wanted was not there and there was no dish i could get for 10 which i thought would be pretty high for the way the establishment looked
my cousin plus her married couple friends were in town the past few days
the almond croissant was delicious
its soft and light like a whipped cloud and perfectly complements the stuffing
needless to say i was completely taken aback by the whole scenery
they have a separate tasting room if you want to skip the food
the margs are worth coming for
although they serve many customers even on their busiest nights they give you all of their attention
but it was free refill on fine noodle so overall not too bad
the pork was all fat and gave me lots of noodles but they all stuck together with very little veges
another bosa location
entree had the char done rm style
completely disappointing and a waste of time and money
their really isnt a place that competes with this place as far as acai goes
i love the buns they put the burger on as well
because the people at yovis are so nice i went back to give them another chance
the restaurant was not full so im not sure if it was a matter of understaffing or new staff
mehwhats all the fuss about
absolutely no reason for just two people to order a large
the fish was lightly battered and not heavy at all
this is my favorite middle eastern restaurant hands down
you are paying pricey money to sit in a disney like san marco mock up in venetian
buddy bowl came with shrimps blacken catfish chicken rice and 4 flour tortillas
the rolls tasted like old grease
wasnt to busy
after being seated or self seating the servers take forever to acknowledge that you sat down and then they take even longer to bring drinks or food and good luck getting a refill or ordering dessert or anything else
he was upset with me because now he was out the product for my 12 order
waiter recommended the phukettini for a drink  a mojitostyle martini
my cousins from switzerland love anything that has a western theme and where better to take them than rawhide
i dont know if this location is different if my taste buds have evolved since i was 19 or if i have to be completely shit faced to eat here but this place is ewwwwww like others have said they use way to much mayo
pretty decent place
my wife asked for a beer on their available board above the bar
i thought the chicken gyro was a little short on the chicken and had too much lettuce
if i eat there food again it will be a pick up order
the coffee is decent but nothing to write home about
the music was soso but the show was pretty impressive lots of lights and lasers choreographed dancers huge banana shaped inflatables beach ball style and even pillows being thrown from the roof into the crowd to add to the carnage
the ribeye was perfectly marbled for a ribeye not too much fat and cooked to medium
service not so good
the meat quality here is good and the beer is very cold
wish i had discovered this place while i still lived in lakewood but its probably still worth the trip across town since its not easy to find good indian food in cleveland
bojangles is a southern staple and if you havent been you should definitely give them a try when youre in the south
all and all a nice experience
i threw up in my mouth a bit
spam fried rice with garlic rice was delicious especially with a little sriracha on the side
the server comes back to get your order
intense but delicious
so make sure you arrive a little early or a little later for meal times
i recommend the chocolate croissant aka pain au chocolat  hands down no contest
it is deceptively sweet and fruity up front
even though our reservations was at 10 it was approaching 1145 until they brought the desert which was really bad also so requested our bill so we could see the fireworks on their patio
ever since the wife introduced me to this place i fell in love
is there a better destination in the whole valley
and those little sauce containers with the sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard sauce did not have covers on them
baked egg custard buns make me drool
its fills you up and leaves you feeling all warm inside
i ordered ahead and my food was ready when i got there
are they ever going to finish construction on camelback
so i ordered my meal anyway scrambled eggs potatoes bacon and a bagel
i would have given it three but thats because of my personal opinion on beer and no fault of cest what
when 5th and wine dared to close over memorial weekend my friend and fellow yelper christina p suggested cd as an alternative
this was out of our price range and we stuck with the summer special
now if you happen to be coming in here for food only they do have a separate dining area
more of a cavelike bar than a restaurant dos diablos was unsurprisingly uncrowded at 530 on a tuesday night
the sausage was my favorite
bf got some pork chop dish that was a little overcookeddry but most of us were happy with our dishes
but for once i shut up and just shoveled the massive amounts of food they serve here down my gullet
i think well be eating at kaylas instead of at mr smalls when we see concerts there
soggy limp with very little flavor
the server showed favoritism to the table next to us
there were 3 pieces of cheese all of which were the same and brie
if i ever come back to the tropicana again and need a bite at 3am i certainly wont have any objections to stopping here
frustrating would have loved to give them a try but will not now nor will we recommend this place to anyone
butternut squash ravioli is one of the best things ive ever had in mah mouth
however  on two separate occasions i have sat on the patio and it really smells very very bad like cat poo
if you can get passed a bit of a wait for your food including appetizers then pasta fresh may be your type of restaurant
i will be back
some of it was excellent some was okay
my only disappointment is that although it claims to serve some organic mixed greens with savory crepes it did not happen with my 2 orders
will definitely be back when friends and family come into town to visit
so asking me to rate an oyster place is like asking tiger woods to rate a golf course
meat itself was good tender
i am also a caseys person so its all the same people only in the daylight and with a hangover
now dont get me wrong i will continue to come here just not as frequent as i use to
the next dish to arrive was 156 sauteed seasonal vegetables with garlic sauce 785 im not an expert on chinese vegetables but after looking at some pictures online i think what we had was choy sum
ive heard a lot of great things about katsuya so i was eager to try this restaurant when i got to las vegas
its almost impossible to try everything here because there is so much
we all liked the taste and the presentation
despite the numerous recommendations and people telling me i had to try this place i resisted because cmon its a buffet
the food was ok but the service was horrible
the servers both times didnt even do half of the steps of service
we were never rushed to leave even long after out meal was paid for
i have them 3 stars because while their drinks are priced reasonably i feel their food is slightly overpriced
are you sick of fighting for tiny bistro table at starbucks to operate out of
my entire office is addicted
gleich verhlt es sich mit der masslos berzogenen preis vorspeisenplatte fr 2 personen und dem anschliessenden fischvarationen
subway also provides a economic option for lunch goers
thats a steal compared to certain japanese and korean restaurants but note that japanese korean dumplings are different from chinese dumplings
the drinks were good i had some cherry martini but it was super sweet
i love this place
it was a sunday evening and it was almost deserted
plenty of parking and seating to work on the laptop or enjoy a conversation with a friend
the bread was cheap but i appreciate that they gave something
they were out of eggs benedict by 11 so disappointed
id probably opt fo the buffets at mandalay bay or paris before this one
i am just in awe and still trying to come down from the high of enjoying this amazing meal
thank you ron for being you
burger was totally lacking any trace of beef flavor and had a really weird mushy texture
now its too late to find anywhere else
being the winner of cupcake wars i had to try them
the burgers literally taste chemical free and in this world  its an awesome awesome alternative from so many mundane and processed garbage hamburger joints out there
my favorite is the century egg with parsley soup paired with thick flat rice noodle with fish ball and fish tou fu
it tasted like tomato paste
my eco activism isnt always consistent
we ordered the 64 ounce monster drink overall a great place to stop by for some decent late night food
they are always fresh and the bread is absolutely delicious hand delivered ace bread on the daily
we decided to have lunch here on our most recent vegas excursion
this place has all the hype and a bit much for the bang
my only complaint is the soda prices are ridiculous but other than that it was a truly enjoyable meal
havent really been to other italian ice or custard places but speaking from my first time experience it was delish
asked to split the bill and that was screwed up
my wife and i stopped in late on a saturday afternoon to try it their food
we attempted to go to beantown tavern today to watch the patriotsdolphins game
this place is quality all the way
thankfully the heating was on full blast so we could survive
everything tasted really good not traditionally good but with a modern twist type of good
we took ours to go and i ordered the family meal
overall i would definitely come back
they all seem to love working there and like the owner
i will give them 4 stars and will revisit my review once we are able to visit more restaurants in the area
i tend to be extremely longwinded with my reviews but i was so tempted to just write yup its a panera bread alright and leave it at that
just try this place youll never regret it
it reminds me of korea
while they did offer to remake the pizza my husband declined as he was starving and didnt want to wait another 45 minutes for what ended up being the worst pizza weve ever had in vegas
this is a little piece of heaven as far tacos go
so good ive been following them on fb and i finally got to try them on this trip i had a beerbattered burger with bacon and vodka sauce and sweet tater tots definitely trying more on their menu when i come back this way
id have gone for a beer instead of water a nice pale ale is almost a necessity but ditnt see any on the menu
the broth was truly authentic and the service was great
ive been several times where ive had to wait much much too long for my food
i live about a mile from here  another 30 minutes go by before i am livid and decide to start making lunch at home
moved to vegas from chicago and tried chicago eateries and never found the right until i found windy city
they always have a great selection of draft beer and its always changing so even if you go once a week theres always something new to try
we had a good group so got to try quite a bit of appetizers gyoza  pretty good its pork and veggies and pan fried
delivery was spot on and order was perfect
service was so awful
they were not there for the meet up group and the name of the reservation they provided to the hostess was not on her list
all the bagels were fresh and delicious with no compliant just prepare yourself for a carb craze meal
i loved that you could eat there 2 outside tables or take it to go  a sweet deal especially if youre staying at the holiday inn across the street
this is the perfect place for couples who want an intimate night of food porn
then the tables in front of us had taller stools  with backs
in the summer the lines are enormous but totally worth the wait
things are popping up in the brand spankin new acorn alley that theyre still in the process of building
they have mexican sodas although the waitress had no clue what flavors were available and they didnt seem to see fit to write in on the menu
we ordered the hummus and vegetarian dolmas stuffed grape leaves for our appetizers
i made my own grain bowl using quinoa kimchee grated carrot grated squash tofu and avocado topped with carrot miso dressing
we had the pressed cubano sandwich and the guava bbq short ribs
you name it
i pretty much do not like authentic chinese food but like the asian fusion style
yes she got my napkins and settings finally togo boxes and take home bag but gee wiz i can see the reason why our waiter lacked basic serving skills
also a side bourbon glazed bacon
und dann hat es gestimmt
when i come back to scottsdale this will be one of the first stops
we also had horchata and i gotta say its one of the best horchatas i ever had
the best option in that baldwin block for good food
the food portion sizes for togo are horrible
we might have been a group of little asian girls but we tore up those crab legs like 200 pound men
very plain jane nothing special
then my husbands burger didnt have the jalepenos that should be in the burger and had lots of onions
now i know what they serve i might stop by here for a quick dinner whenever i feel like it
first of all i did have some doubts that the sushi would be good but it was fantastic
husband and wife run the entire restaurant
atmosphere was bland and there were gnats and flies zipping around us the whole time we were there
did chris christie come into town
they had a large staff already making sandwiches for a possible pickup order and i was greeted with a welcoming crew
i do not like cheese vegan or otherwise
let me tell you what a difference a filter makes
we go to watch the cover bands play for the novelty of walking around outside with our drinks and to hit up the carnival world buffet at least once or twice
i hope this place gets better
if you want ambiance just think chinese food and oldies  sold
their vietnamese coffee wakes me up too
the cleanliness was very good considering the amount of time the servers have to clean the table since there are so many customers
they clearly dont know what they are doing and given the type of space it was built to accommodate such
deliciousness in creaminess form
there is a very competitive coffee environment in downtown between lola lux giant fair trade hob nobs jobot etc
chicken thighs were chopped up and served nicely in the container but there was very little chicken
just get here early there will be a line
as we were exiting the restaurant the fishy odor was so strong we could hardly breathe
but for a counter service place you can do better for yourself at several other places in town
my info had been skimmed and stolen
i even started to think it might not be so bad to have a job downtown again such is the power of the place
i was expecting the food could taste better than average chinese restaurant food because of the name
highly disappointed  i had previously enjoyed a good meal at this restaurant
im not one to walk away from desserts but after two bites i knew something was wrong and didnt finish it
will go again and maybe try something else
she was very nice and said she would send someone over
decent quality floorstanding home speakers suspended in mid air with hip music being streamed constantly
once our orders were taken the food arrived fairly quickly no mistakes or wrong items
we always make sure to eat here once when we are in town but now the la one open so the 4 stars is soley for the one thing you must order fried chicken with their wasabi honey sauce
server was enthusiastic and efficient
im a vegas local and ive heard so much good things about the bellagio buffet so i decided to go check it out should have stuck with bucchanal or the ph
we took advantage of the fact that it was the weekend and we slept in until noon
it is a bit small cozy but they have patio service also so when the weather breaks lower than 120 degrees we will be able to enjoy   they also have a great brunch on the weekends with mimosa  bloody mary specials
the rest of the restaurant was jampacked though
the only person present was the bartender well someone in the bar area
the halohalo presentation was like no other
the moist brisket was my favorite
been here twice now and i could go here everyday
ill be honest it wasnt the way the pizza looked that had my taste buds salivating with anticipating temptation
found the ambiance to be cluttered but probably one of this chains trademarks
the steaks up there are dry aged so they develop a great depth of flavor
i would recommend mon ami gabi for dates good food birthdays or if you just want a classy meal
my procrastination was looking like it was going to hurt me as every restaurant i called was jammed packed
dont go to cha lau dim sum unless you want to spend your entire meal figuring out if the kitchen was making budget cuts and charging you extra
worth every penny
we love oe their servers are friendly and attentive and the food is always hot and fresh
had to repeat myself
full of flavor and unique
although we werent asked how we preferred the steak it arrived rare exactly as we would have requested
dont be sucked in to the hype of other eateries butters food and service is always top notch
we ended up paying about 10 bucks a person
always fresh and so good
and to top it off you dont have to tip for an overpriced burger combo
so why cant they seat people
will be back
ordered the scallops as a starter and they were a rubbery and over cooked
but i had to try this place out
comme ce nest pas un menu  typique  de brunch ce nest pas si facile de simaginer ce qui se trouvera dans notre assiette
the waffle was soggy and undercooked as well
try it once and you will be hooked
but togoshi ramen was there for my sick congested self with its simple shoyu ramen
went here for a last minute dinner with my husband and son
flavorful falafels smooth creamy hummus delicious tahini sauce fresh veggies and pita bread
these guys make everything fresh on site except the bread
reminiscent of fairfax district in la farmers market good times
for 7 for a large that is small its not worth it to me
i spent 1650 for six cheese raviolis that did not taste right  and 795 for 5 bland and undercooked zuchinnis
vegan options and vegetarian options with faux beef and faux chicken pulled pork shrimp fish etc prices are cheap 3 tacos for 10 2 for 10 quesadillas and 10 large burrito small was 8 i think the bad lacking in flavour
i guess ill take solace in the fact that i am still supporting a local franchise   the place itself is pretty spacious and ideal for groups
hope it hasnt changed too much
i would give it zero stars if i could
the atmosphere of restaurant and service are good but there are little black flys around the place and even a dead one on the menu
the tables and chairs were drapped with cloth but nothing that would catch youre eye
i have been here dined in as well as drive through about 5 times
im a huge fan of this place for lunch
i finally left my dog unattended on the sidewalk to go in and find out what happened to be told oh we were looking for you
we had great service and delicious food
great food great service and great drinks
yeah little ladies pushing dim sum carts may be cooler but having it made to order helps the quality and certainly prevents them from drying outsomething that happens all too often at the other places
unfortunately the former chef and cooks from both chada street and chada thai  wine have departed and its not hard to see why
the fries were delicious too and tasted pretty fresh although they couldve used a little salt
definitely have to try it
they have a good variety of bagels i usually get an asiago or cheddar jalepeno bagel
his pork was a little dry though the only con
overall experience i thought the service was great
fast food greek
however this was expected as it provides a different setting and menu
the service was excellent
they served foccacio as the bread which was decent with the oil balsamic and grated cheese mixture i made
my constant and intense eye contact was clearly giving him pause
im glad i dined here to try it out but it didnt make me want to come back especially with so many other places to try in vegas
the waitress told him that she already had to pay for the food she dropped and that the bar makes the waitstaff pay for mistakes out of their own pocket
the service was quite slow and it took a good 15 minutes to receive forks that we requested
granted i may have been slowed down by dipping several slices of bread into the sauce
they reopen again at 5pm for dinner service   so just a note  in case you want to come by here for a late lunch
there is a different beer special each day
short and sweet review
its not fun spending lunch wishing i had tried something else
great selection of meals
i didnt feel awkward wearing my rob zombie dawn of the con shirt and jeans which may not have flown in a more posh location
we went on a monday evening for dinner
more reasonably priced than its neighbor the dinner and brunch here are fantastic
finish off your meal with another riceful in the form of tres leche pudding in essence a rice pudding with coconut whole milk mango and caramelized banana  it is divine
meat was raw and food was just not good
mixed house with garlic sauce for white rice and spicy house and house for salad
not suitable for adults let alone kids
dsol pour le proprio hypersympathique que j ai reconnu du temps de dagiovani vous avez besoins monsieur de nouveau chef
mine was bland burnt and the veggies raw
the goat was among the toughest ive ever had the paneer was flavorless and even the naan was rather lacking
best bbq in charlotte
regardless i still highly recommend this place
you have to come before they close as i dont know how long they will be around for since theyre just a pop up store
believe it or not we showed up here about 0745 on a weekend morning and not a soul in sight
the bbq ribs i ordered barely had any meat on them
stopped here because greek sounded interesting and there was a guy standing out front that was very friendly and couldnt say enough good things about the food
this is a local restaurant that will blow your socks off
2 our drink order was taken
the decor and environment gave cafe zinho a nice offthebeaten path look
no answer 920pm comes i drive there
the dynamic roll had spicy tuna salmon and avocado
i found the vindaloo to have sufficient heat but to be more sour than i might expect and i found the meat chicken to be oddly fatty
dun point de vue culinaire les plats sont bons
their bbq sauce is fantastic their chili is great when in season and their beans are delicious
staff is friendly and helpful
i made reservations for 730 we arrived there at 715 the hostess said we would be seated closer to 730 and that was fine
very different setting
i added a bit more salt to the chicken to make it taste just right for me
14 from the hot pot mixed mushrooms and tofu hot pot
cashier searching for the order ticket um 15 minutes
i was hoping you could build your own salads but you are not given that options
i think so
we can make another one
youre still the one i run to the one that i belong to youre still the one i want for life yes nak won was the second korean restaurant i went to in my entire life back in high school and 15 or so years later its still the one i go to when i crave korean food
die pizza hier schmeckt brigens auch ganz gut
i would not give any stars if it were up to me
these folks have it going on
this place is like a crack haven for sweettoothed folks like me
i got a signature sandwich with chips  bottled water
we also came here for new years and requested a bottle of champagne and the owner even set us up with a table for us and our friends
as always the food is great i went with a couple friends and we ordered the tapas menu and had like 11 things highlights were bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates calypso chips tortilla espanola ceviche and the mojito mmmmmmm the service was great
and i kept thinking the same thing that i thought on the first visit why isnt this as good as taco bell
our server was horrible this must be his first restaurant job cause he suck
easy to get to the strip from here with the monorail stop
the food is delicious too
plus if you like sports there are a ton of tvs in the place
the eggplant came within 20 minutes
as we reach the fateful moment the house lights came on again in the same spot much to the chagrin of audience
we will definitely go back
because both of us were not very hungry we decided to have a quick dinner and share everything
the only bad thing i can say about them is the fact they only come with three to an order  i would eat like 9237965  fb roll what the heck is there not to like about this
waitwhy am i talking about him
the pizza was incredible
i was so stuffed and happy by the time we finished
very traditional tasting slightly on the saltier side but we dipped bread in it
this consisted of sliced turkey some ribs a duck leg and a color pop from asparagus and cranberry sauce
our food also came out almost immediately which made me question how fresh prepared this place really is
the tacos are solid too and the wet burritos are great
kind of an awkward location that doesnt give you the vibe that your out for a drink
this place is really a gem
they have a cool bar set up with plenty of tvs but honestly the service has been less than stellar each time weve gone and by less i mean like not even close
my very handsome boyfriend on the other hand was given a hard time from beginning to end
we dont live in the area so its highly doubtful that well be back but if we did live here we most likely wouldnt recommend this place
meal 2 moo goo gai pan
several of my friends are quite fond of the leglifter light
i was expecting the onions to be more simple and not marinated with a balsamic vinegar and i found the dijon sauce excessive and rather sweet
i had a whirling dervish which was a delight of tangy flavour
oh man i do believe i will make those my meal next time
all agreed it was a great lunch
such a nice change from the places where the person behind the counter barely looks at you
at first i was dragged here but now i embrace every experience like its my last
we try to make it to their happy hour once a weekwhich is everyday from 3pm6pmand they have great deals on sushi rolls
i look young and the waitress treated me like a kid who wouldnt tip spent 80 that night on me and my date and the service was crap
i can easily eat one combo plate for 23 meals
were not sure if youre supposed to automatically park yourself on the benches or go inside first to sign in or what
its a clear favourite for consistently good food and despite being a bit more expensive than other chinese joints in the area the margin is well worth it
i will definitely be stopping here every vegas trip i make
i think i would rather have a table thanks
if youre going to charge over 12 for a bowl of chashu ramen and then charge me 150 to add an egg were looking at 14bowl which is more than i ever paid in the bay area
the wait wasnt too bad there was about 2030 minutes before we were seated
the bartender was very knowledgeable about the house brews as well as the guest taps and was very friendly and engaging considering how busy the bar was
usually appetizers will sit heavy and then by the time your entree comes you dont really have room for more food but not here and i really think its due to the way the food was prepared
the booths were nice enough for date night
it was impossible to get the attention of our server so we just ate it as is and felt pouty
had a bite of the burrata and grapes
good coffee too
i just dont really like the vibe of this place
i  asked to hostess how long it will takes if i sit in patio and she said we have to wait 20mins to sitting in
the egg was done perfectly and the fresh chopped tomato salsa was really fresh
positives the menu has a good selection clean modern restaurant fresh ingredients negatives food wait time was long compared to competitors food took 10 minutes to come out at spicy pickle vs less than 5 minute average at jasons deli my gobbler sandwich had practically no meat on it it was just one slice thick
and the peanut sauce was nothing to write home about  probably peanut butter with some type of chili sauce mixed in
we were seat and greeting within a couple of minutes of arriving by nathan
spent 8 dollars for 4 tacos is a little excessive especially when they were nothing to brag about
the atmosphere is okay
the food was very good and the portions were good
this is the best restaurant ever my family loves it
a side note there were several ants real ones not the decorations crawling all over the wall next to the soda machine
again i cannot begin to explain how delicious our meal was
our service was great
she asked for another salad and we took it to go
but way more delicious
both came out well done and super dry
the owner
there are pages upon pages of various teas and smoothies who wouldve thought
everything was literally so good
i also expected a big bill but it was surprisingly reasonable for such fresh quality and cooked on the spot food
the broth is descent and selection of toppings is on par with other places
i was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going
either the seat was too low or the table was too high which meant my food was closer to chin level than stomach level
my girlfriend was sceptical about eating here
the salami cheese bread
we werent sure which cuts of beef to order so we ordered one of each and an order of the pork belly
service is definitely a minus one of the worst for a thai restaurant
everything was well packaged but tasted the same
for food i had the dubina fries which were tasty and a good addition to the beer
it was lukewarm
they offered to correct our drinks if for any reason we werent happy with them  the gesture is appreciated but we didnt even need them fixed
a combo order comes with fries and drinks
the sauce had some diced red and yellow peppers and had a good amount of a kick to it
i really like their menu and believe they have the best rewards program of any restaurant i frequent
the booths they have must be for kids or for way back in the 40s when everyone was tiny
just the bombcom
they were probably fine but i dont care for them
get straight to the point and take these women to the crab legs
great food photos
note hot tea here is 195 would have assigned 3 stars purely on phood and prices  but greatfriendly staff and service make this a 4 star review
ive had the grass jelly roasted milk tea with 30 sugar and no ice
ideal for lunch or dinner
love this place in plaza midwood
taco haus has over 36 tequilas 20 beers including big bombers
it was worth lining up 30 minutes for
the owner immediately made me a new dish when i told him the beef was a bit overcooked and i would love to have some authentic chinese food
great food fast and fresh
peaceful music playing setting a nice tone
i guess i can say that this is cool to check out once the food was decent not the best ive had and the drinks only had a splash of alcohol and were over priced
if you only want beef after the first round of order you would have to eat pork and chicken before the second helpings of beef
theres always something for everyone at all hours of the day  coffee bar wine bar sandwich bar salad bar and the deli
that was awesome
service was pretty good they forgot our silverware and napkins until our food came and i got up and asked for some
you have your choices from a bowl to burrito salad or tacos you choose your meats which the barbacoa and the pork were really good then you have veggies which are a little weak wish they had more selection and the sauces
butterfish daily special with spicy aioli and fresh vegetables  butterfish was grilled perfectly and melts in your mouth
for those who miss chicago pizza this is the real deal
i would recommend this place to anyone looking to watch sports and hang out with friends
burger nirvana or burger heartache
i intend to return
it did satisfy my dimsum craving though
this is extremely irresponsible and unprofessional to not give the customer any notification that they will not be receiving their order
soups werent anything spectacular
lets just say the food is on point
its obvious why they have won the wine spectator grand award every year since 1999  the sommelier knew the collection very well and and helped us pick out some amazing bottles
they have a miso soup machine which i found quite interesting
the chocolate was hard to taste in the cream
if you are looking for good pho this place has one of the best in phoenix
of course then i had the food and i was really pleased
should have known from the startthe food ended up being louslyand not a little 4 of us got no sleep from cramping
to each his own i suppose but the fact that his omelet like my benedict was nothing memorable makes me not want to go out of my way to return here for breakfast
which btw is sooooooooooooo yummy
prices are decent too about what youd expect to pay at a typical diner and its cash only
ive been here couple times already  prob 510 times and everytime i go here i always order the pasta carbonara
das ambiente uriger gewlbekeller der steile treppenabgang ist mit teelichte auf den treppenstufen geschmckt
there are certain things that i like and one of them is certainly tasty salsa
nothing was offered with the meal no bread or salad
the food comes out really fast and the servers are not a few feet away
this is a wonderful hybrid of a more cheesy custard that taste much like a cheesecake yet still custardy and with a shortbread crust rather than the regular flaky crust
but this was then followed by a salty greasy puffy bread
as you seeput together sloppily and served not so hot
there is something missing thoughi had the ricotta gnudi as a main and wasnt thrilled
stopped off mid road trip for a bite to eat
weather permitting try to sit on the upstairs patio
we came last week
i ordered the side of mac n cheese and mashed potatoes with the meal  yea super healthyi know
unfortuantely there was more bread and slaw than hot dog  my husband didnt think anything was special about his burger
pros  friendly staff
actually i dont remember how we found it
hadnt gone back cause this is what will drive me nuts
the hot fries on the other handman those suckers got really spicy after a while
funny story before i knew better i tried to order a blt there
we will certainly not forget about palermos anytime soon
dont forget to order some oxtail fries
luckily the hostess offered to seat us in the connecting party room since they werent having any private functions tonight
and a drink
line actually moved fairly quickly
for 1500 you can get a lot better with real and fresh ingredients
normally id go apeshit on this place but im feeling lenient today
delicious food and the service is the golden winner here
shredded chicken in my burrito as well as the meat was kind of dry and really wasnt the best kind of meat or chicken
the broth was perfect
food not good
nothing bad to say about the big mac the pork belly or the fried chicken sliders except they were all a bit messy
the bread on my tuna salad was tasty and well toasted but thats where it ended
we have tried other places but this is by far the best
it depends on how much personal space you can go without
the peameal itself was gross
the decor is so awesome
they waiter was very kind and attentive
it is awful
it took less than 5 minutes to get the correct entree a lettuce wrapped burger out which makes me think they just used the same burger and changed the toppings
its definitely a datenight sort of place
the soup was good with just a hint of heat in flavour but the 4 level in my pad see ewe was way too spicy when i first are it
we unfortunately did not
the coal replenishment sucks and they constantly being out small half used coals
amazing food and friendly service
and the service is friendly and efficient
they comped us a free dessert for sending it back
tia rosa used to be the best mexican food ever until the original place burnt down
wish i could give negative stars
reminded me of when you eat yesterdays chicken leftovers
the baked potato toppings were so good
hubby got a large soup which was not that much larger for 395
this time around it didnt have any bad smell at all
im sorry but three strikes and youre out with me
but i will say this for a fake cannoli it was a good fake
the food and beer at both are phenomenal
i was excited to try this place out as its close to home and has the appearance of an authentic italian momandpop restaurant with a great deal on tuesdays when you get 25 off your entire pickup order
fin hate this place
food didnt leave a great impression and neither did our waitress who seemed a little pissy
even as we were leaving we all said good byes
ok  i want to give more stars here because the people are very nice
just not quite as neatly kept
the goat cheese was great but everything else wasnt too memorable
bf likes his salted pretzel while i try to be a litte healthy by getting mine whole grain
anyway bitching aside my lunch here was super meh
i always get their bean burritos mmmmm mmmm they have the salsa bar with cucumbers green sauce red sauce and jalapenos
in a town like las vegas where its very difficult to sift through all of the countless restaurants its refreshing to find one that has quality and value
we asked a couple times to bring us water and he took his fancy time doing that
she also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options
my motherinlaw was drinking coffee with her meal and we were almost done with the entree before the waitress even checked if she wanted more and then brought her a fresh cup but left the old dirty cup on the table
the beef with chinese broccoli was decent
it was colorless plain and the broth was full of japanese smg
the tuna and avocado with their sauce as a garnish was great
every bar in 1 mile of that place is 100 better
we where going to go for drinks at a local bar but decided to stay and sit at the bar
if youre a vegetarian like me enjoy the avocado causa or perucian potatoes and youre good to go
my main complaint with this location is accuracy
i love the rice and the soon tofu put together  its an amazing combo very light and you dont feel gross after eating there at all
fyi  it is sad
hadnt been this satisfied with a meal in a while
gyro was decent but as others have previously mentioned the tzatziki was like sour cream not yogurty
my 8 year old son loves this family tradition in old town
i was very disappointed
food was really good but expensive
there are far to many places in vegas to select from i wont be back
for an extra 2 worth of vegetables which places like komol load your plate with happily at 895 a plate for tofu  veggie panang pin kaow delivers a mediocre overpriced 1295 for about a cup and a 12 of curry dishnot to mention the fact that your pricey 2 veggies consist of about two stalks of broccoli four small mushrooms and a some shards of bamboo shoots
the portions were scanty though i shouldnt complain too much
that speaks to the popularity of this place
he says i was suppose to say i have indicard before i order drinks
this sums up what   i ate
particular points of pride are their combined selection of inhouse and craft beers
for appetizers we had fried calamari and the lobster for the main course i went for the tenderloin medium well and i never dined here before so i thought the sides came with the main dish
good job in loosing eight customers in one fell swoop
the people here are generally really friendly and theyve also got wifi if youd like to get some work done just like i am right now
decor is kinda tacky feels pretty worn
i ordered their spicy miso special dec 2014 jan 2015 and that should be a main staple on the menu because its the best tasting ramen if you are into spicy
they were packed on the saturday morning after thanksgiving and my mom and i patiently waited for a seat while ogling the delicious looking pastries in the display case
my husband also felt that the meat portion is smaller here than at other vietnamese restaurants
the plate was served with warm soft thick buttery toasted bread which was great for spreading cheese
then we returned for a birthday dinner last tuesday for a vegetarian friend
there were some large parties that looked like they were having a hoot
they had run out of milk so we couldnt have lattes but all in all my experience at trevor last night was almost perfect
she knew the whole menu and she never missed a beat with our group
service was pretty good and i enjoyed the ambiance of the place
i really liked that they had pictures of everything on the menu
we had a 7pm reservation on friday night and the restaurant had a few tables full but was still pretty quiet
service is friendly and courteous and  they helped with directions to my next stop later but a tiny bit slow
they have a small salad bar and a couple of types of soups to choose from they have an international station which usually features a taco bar mediterranean cuisine such as falafel lamb gyro lebanese rice tahini sauce  more usually a chefs special chinese food eggrolls sweet and sour pork fried rice a couple of soups a really tasty carving station very nice juicy turkey prime rib and ham with the proper side dishes today was whipped potatoes deep fried creamed corn yum
absolutely delicious  my boyfriend and i went for my birthday and enjoyed every bite
their marinara sauce is to die for
if you like vintage things there is a sigma derby one of only two that i think are in the city buried in the slot machines near the sports book
this rude employee yelled my name louder and rolled her eyes
if you go for lunch the services are just the right size and you get crispy won ton noodles also
save your money and bypass this crude attempt at entertainment
also they dont sell their sauces on the internet which meant that i didnt get to bring any home with me given that i wasnt willing to check my bag for the flight home
our server was immediately by our side asking if we needed refreshments
first time in this restaurant and we were  pleasantly surprised
however this fruit was clearly freshly cut and perfectly ripe
it looks like they have a live jazz band that plays a bit later in the evening but we werent able to stay this time
i ordered the whole flounder and it was fried to a crisp
normally this is eaten hot but mine was taken as a packed lunch during my hike
once your in line the hard part is over
however food is clearly about quality not quantity
wait for itbergushi
for just over 15 after taxtip its not the best deal but you get what you pay for which is some quality sushi
the biryani was definitely more bangladeshi which was really nice to have
thank you donny
i love this place
let me preface this by saying that jaleo still has some kinks to work out but it has 4 star potential
i went to christophers for my birthday last night and left disappointed
omakase and fresh wasabi
we had the scallops appetizer salad and a burger which was the best burger every the beer menu has some nice choices and of course indulged on the the blache du chamblay on tap which is rare to find  in the city
i will definitely visit this place again
the owner is very personable and funny
our bill per head of course with alcohol in a private room was 370person for three course meal
this is a fairly standard issue hong kong style chinese restaurant right at dundas and spadina complete with roasted meat hanging in the windows milelong menus and nononsense service by wait staff with no interest in being friendly
the lines can start getting long around 9 am but if you arrive early enough before 830 am you can beat the rush
one of the best new restaurants in madison
great coffee tasty sandwiches friendly patrons and staff nice atmosphere everything about this place is good
our waitress was very nice and stopped by four or five times until we were half way through the meal
so for several months i scoped this place out checked out this restaurant online and with daily drivebys in my daily commute
since i was not used to the area we decided to go to the restaurant with the most people sitting inside i know great way to finding good food p
yesterday i visited this nice and always crowded joint for brunch again
the wonton soup was decent but needed some salt and pepper
the place seems always busy and fun
i had the short rib tacos which were amazing although the meat was a tad dry
the restaurant alone is clean and well decorated awesome interior design great food attentive staff and great array of age and ethnic customers
it was perfectly balanced with the salty black olives
the food was good i loved our server ashley she was polite attentive and made the whole experience great
5 stars will definitely return for special occasions or just to treat myself
i loved the decoration music and vibe of the placeand the service was top notch
this is why i give them 4 stars instead of 5   our server on the other hand was wonderful
after my utterlydisappointing bbq roll through kc i realized just how much i appreciate honey bears
worth to try and i definitely back
first started coming in 2014 and i love it
i was impressed to see so many different kinds of people hanging out
we would rate this highly if not for the jerky kids up front
i will definitely not be back anytime i have a party larger than 2 or 4 or anytime im on a time crunch
great unique subs sometimes on the weekend it can get a little backed up so place your order over the phone
id probably come back
server was quick attentive and not hard on the eyes
i love the decor of this shop its very bright and energizing
why not try a worldclass restaurant for a few hours
they are very good though
the portion was decent and the curry was rich
this is one of the best in las vegasimho
i hate when burgers are so overseasoned that you cant taste the beefthis one was perfect
the omelet and potatoes were so huge that i barely got 12 if it down before quitting
there are tvs placed around the tables in case your date is boring and your phone is running out of battery
they played reggae and dancehall music which shot me straight back to bar hopping and high school dances
im partial to margherita pizzas no matter where i eat my pizza but the sopressata and rapini pizza was excellent as well
the meat was tender and flavorful
the smell of mint from the frehlymade mojitos hit us as we walked through and whet our appetite for a cocktail from the very long selection list and both were happy with our choices
dlux is also a member of the food fight restaurant club which is great
when the bread is super hard or gross ill just pick out the innards with my fork to eat and leave the bread behind
deep fried quesadillas
were the type of people that are loyal to good people that make an effort to meet and engage with their customers and wes does just that
id say splitting this dish between two people would leave someone hungry if you didnt have other dishes
the whole meal was 65 without tip  really not bad
magical when youre a kid expect more when youre an adult
the pizza crust was so flavorful and just delicious
the sushi is really good but the rolls are way too small for the price
he had an awesome voice and offered to take requests
a bunch of different meats and cheeses and they were all tasty
great first experience  service sarcasm
the air conditioning wasnt working when we went today no biggie there were fans all over the place and they were trying to actively get it fixed
we started off with the king crab appetizer and a cold beef tenderloin that had a killer spicy ponzu sauce  awesome presentation and both very impressive
since there are always different options he usually gives everyone little samplers to try out what you like
we asked out server for suggestions and he confirmed a few of the dishes that we had been eyeing on the menu
always looking forward for a night at cava always
like the environment and the chairs but dunno why theres a jewelry stand inside
i dont understand how some of these girls in vegas get these waitressing jobs and make a boat load of tips yet be so stupid
the coconut shrimp was great and the fish tacos are insane and almost too much to eat
overcooked or bad flavor
sandwich was burnt on the end and soda area was pretty nasty
love my latest find
advice  dont hesitate to ask questions and engage the staff
the menus had dried food on them and looking around they needed to wipe down the light and seats better
well these four chefs have 18 months to make it or break it
i think this restaurant is what saves imperial palace to tell you the truth
i visit thailand occasionally and this place has the best thai food ive had in toronto comparable to food in thailand
we ordered the humus to start and the chicken breast and lamb kebabs for mains
this has confirmed it
to be fair i have only been here once
i ordered the beef bowl and lumpia
this place is definitely good pho
this combo menu was not in the menu but on the wall
this place works miracles
our flat bread appeared to be a frozen entree from trader joes and the buffalo chicken queso reminded us of reheated jarred cheese from the grocery store with a handful of tortilla chips straight from the bag
i would recommend this place and will be returning back soon
by far your shop is the diamond in the desert
no complaints on this part
i love jamaican food
almost 30 for nongourmet paninis
great service and a great spot for lunch
jamais besoin de faire la file pour djeuner car on nest pas sur le plat ici  le wifi gratuit
as someone that was sober enjoys a great quality steak this was a bitter disappointment
which was a nice surprise
they often leave out items when delivering and take a pretty long time to do so
its organic super cute and they have cool different lattes that arent overly sweet like toasted marshmellow and toasted almond mocha
the fillings of the tacos were flavourful and the portion was just enoughmy favourite was their bulgogi taco
mini thali of rice or noodles with chilly chicken and curry chicken and chutney with coconut flavored cabbage
when you call yourself a gourmet sandwich shop it must be better than subway
live band friday night
my fianc ordered one of the burgers i was pretty full and didnt get a chance to try it but he said it was pretty good but the outside was charred
review based on three visits
while i was sad to see local breeze go i love with fig what i lovingly refer to it as has done with the place
macarons tarts cakes palmers croissants canneles mmmmmm we ended up opting for three canneles one palmier it was huge and a chocolate eclair all for take out
it made me feel like the bumper sticker decor of the early eighties was just a distraction to make you forget everything else that was unpalatable
they have dr browns cel ray
one thing about this place is that its consistent
i simply could not do a review of this place and give them any less than a 5 star rating
wir waren am 297 mit 10 personen zum bruch im fasanenwald
a simple vacation turned into a ghastly experiencemy saving grace was the little mute cabin boy who bailed me out of that african gaol with no more than a wink and a quart of whiskey
so heres some tips while eating there
they do have regular hand pulled noodles these are shaved off a piece of dough
yum yum yum
the food was great with a diverse breakfast menu the staff was very friendly and the location is very scenic
every single time they never cease to amaze me with a horrible delivery time and cold frozen prepackaged food the mozzarella sticks orache string g and hot in multi
cup o joe and the 1 breakfast with 1 pancake 2 eggs and bacon
i should have listened to the bartenders suggestion and gotten the burger instead
ive been eating at georgios for over 15 years
i cant wait to get boba city cafes thai tea boba smoothie again and try other things on their big menu
super affordable lunch spot with some of the best gyros ive ever had
i love it when my cocktails have a little bit of flair
very rich corny and the prawns cooked absolutely perfectly
expect to wait 40 minutes for your food to arrive and then watch the waiters ask every table on the way if the order is theres or not
my bone broth and eggs benedict cured my satanic hangover and what was once a body filled with toxicity and death is now filled with nutrients and healthy fresh food
this place was amazing
needless to say i will deffinetly be back to canoe next time im in toronto
venue is simple but the entry door creates drafts even with the airlock that was added
cooked absolutely perfectly
walk into miracle mile via the south entrance
but once he figured out his mistake he apologized and said he must have misheard me
if you have a large group dining in las vegas you cant do better than oscars
the meat was cooked to perfection unlike many other places that habitually overcook and dry out otherwise good lamb
there was a group of us dining and we all said we would never come back
we mainly ordered appetizers like wings mozzarella cheese sticks artichoke dips potato skins and few more
the food and drinks are authentic the staff are all friendly and knowledgeable but the real reason to head to pomo is to meet the owner stefano fabbri
for the quality of the food the prices were reasonable and there were selections on the menu from just over 1000 all the way up to 6000 or more
i dont own a business so maybe im just biased towards customers point of view but really its just disappointing to know that i would have gotten a better meal for less money at another place
the comments below on how service can be a bit slow makes me laugh  slow down enjoy your food
i feel like they could do more branding with the wolf image
the food and service were excellent
this was really nice
we had watermelon and fritos
not a fan of their hoagiescheeseburger hoagie was scary  mystery meatchicken parm hoagie was a soggy bland messmaybe try the pizza next time
jewel in the heart of sunnyslope
not sure if well be back
dont forget about ordering desserts
i have tried a lot of thai place and this is definitely not one of the more authentic ones
the food was good but nothing special
asian fusion is putting it mildly at this fabulous vietnamese out of the way restaurant
i completely recommend it
the inside and outside needs work though
the drink menu is a few beers some smoothies popnothing really notable but youre probably not there for the beverages anyhow
almost globby  house lo mein  noodles over cooked too much sauce meat beef chickenshrimp
they can be located through facebook and on their own website which can be found through google
i had fish and chips
service was excellent along with the food
i ordered 3 hot dogs and told them i had a coupon 2 for 4
i have tasted indian food in many restaurants but this has unique taste
my bff and i were walking in christown spectrum mall last night when we came upon wingstop
definitely the best french restaurant in the area
the restaurants in the valley  were uneven inconsistent  and rarely approaching  good fare found in  in big  sea board cities
now hes really confused
with a party organized like the yelp event we had there adding drinks and food help to relax people and get those creative juices flowing
couldnt have had a better experience
if not im going to submit my service survey online as well because this crap with this specific location needs to end
it was fun
and theres no excuse to the treatment we received from them not even acknowledging me or apologizing for the inconvenience
made reservations for vday and totally expected so much more
we ended our meal with a ginger peach cake that was delicious but too rich in flavor for summer
its bo time
yesterday i came one step closer to completing that mission
i want to come back and try their desserts and coffee and maybe some smoothie too
its really clean on the inside and the dcor was spot on for a quickservice campus place like this
ive never had a pork rib so tender and meaty and the brisket could be cut with a plastic fork
she looks at us with a surprised and disgusted look
our service was excellent and our waitress never let our glasses get empty and was happy to offer information about the restaurant its owners and explanation of the dishes we were unfamiliar with
one thing i really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location
pizza and pasta were solid
will def take more pics next time
i had booked my reservation very easily through a website called open table via the top of the world website link
one side entirely english and the other entirely french reduced the clutter
the seating is open and comfortable with just the right amount of ambient noise
the food is good for a fish camp restaurant
i have eaten at patou a couple of times and i have always enjoyed myslef
it is to be commended that people care about their customers
for the most part impressive  especially the bacon wrapped dates ridiculously tasty
i have been to this place late at night every time its like that you cant get what you want because its all ready put away
i couldve eaten a bowl of it
we got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads because thats what the real pansies order
thanks chef paco
the food was alright but for the price and the amount of the serving it would be below average
a refreshing and leisurely experience for us new yorkers
the eggs were poached perfectly
even if you dont they have a complimentary valet service
sweet and floral garnished with osmanthus petals the rice balls in osmanthus soup was a great surprise from all this gluttonous and spicy eats weve been having
did the rice overtake or is it some creammilk
it can be busy on the weekends so try to beat the rush
we would definitely go back to try other goodies on the menu
ate here for brunch
the staff is very attentive and highly coordinated
without ac in summer it can get hot in there probably need better ventilation friends complained their clothes smelled like smoke after the meal but guess what  after our meal we step outside and have a smoke eye roll bottom line  good food and huge portions for your  if youre a little princess who cant stand waiting a few minutes to be seated and must have ac and someone serving you hand and foot then this isnt the place for you
you dont want to eat at this place too often but when you want to indulge this is the place
overall i would recommend this place to any of my friends
i am just hooked on the plain simple perfect gyro they have been granting us in their 30 years in business
i  cant believe they didnt have them the last time i was there
but we all have that guilty pleasure that for whatever reason provides us with comfort after a rough day
we wont be back and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone
the mashed potatoes were very creamy and topped with that delicious lobster chunks then came the chowdah
with good food and okay drinks this place is just average
again both were good but not great especially considering the prices
they have several choices and ive tried a few and im never disappointed
ill definitely be coming back soon
located at new york new york casino and hotel
to start off the hostess accommodated our request for another table which was appreciated
our server was definitely a lifer
the golden nugget buffet is the worst buffet i have ever encountered
1 sehr sauber schn gestaltete rumlichkeiten
however the last time i went to terroni i had never been so insulted by a restaurant in my entire life
had prosciutto olives salami cheese  delish
just arrived home with my two bowls
i kindly told her that theres a hair in this and requested that she take the dish away altogether as i obviously wouldnt want it
location 5 stars  right off the fwy cheyenne exit  the fat  we came out of target and wanted something fast to eat
miso soup salty and lacking flavor
essen ist ok mehr aber auch nicht
when it was check time i literally had to hunt my waitress down
im new to hakkastyle cuisine but i saw they offered dishes with tofu and had a serious tofu craving last night so i stopped by for takeout
the food is good the portions are big the drink selection is nice
i can tell you that i will be going back to hogs heaven again and again
i cant really describe it any other way
we all ordered something different off the menu salmon tacos pizza bison burger pasta carbonara etc and they all left us more than satisfied
he tried to be enthusiastic
bachannal was such a disappointment but this place was perfect
i heard a lot about this place especially when were talking about top 10 burger places in toronto
plan on coming back
before setting foot inside we saw a couple of customers so we decided to give it a try
the one picture of their food does look good
it had grilled calamari and prawns but it wasnt anything to write home about
all in all i think its a decent stop but not a must when visiting toronto
im pretty sure ive seen one of the bartenders tending at acacia before too
she stated we had been there too long and refused a refund
2 stars for the cleanliness and nice staff but for a restaurant the food needs to be flavorful and needs to taste good
les plats sont dfinitivement non conventionnel du genral tao au bison ragot de wapiti et saumon gravlax
we eat out all the time so ordering bbq is a treat since bbq delivery is quite unusual
will not dine here again
so the whole thing is very disappointing and now im wondering what im going to have for lunch now that i finished this expensive tiny salad
the entirety of the shop roll their eyes in unison
the tallarin saltado was also nicely done the lomo flavor was on point and the onions and tomatoes were also cooked perfectly
i was really impressed with the beer flavors and quality and i was super happy that we stumbled into the bar during happy hour
sausage patties are homemade and amazing
the egg was close to being properly cooked and the garlic was just a smear on the edge of the bowl
the egg was prepared light
we stuck with the special rolls because they were so wellpriced not saying the other items on the menu didnt sound good but since everyone has been raving about the rolls we decided to try them and ordered the ocean dream lion king and boston special rolls
hendersons little hole in the wall
bread and butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal dont just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car
for a chain i thought this was actually pretty good
i would rather go to famous daves for a chain that place is pretty good  has some great sauces
the honey balls are pretty sickeningly sweetunless you have a crazy sweet tooth i suggest avoiding it
there were a couple of times when i seriously felt like just walking out
we had the lava cake for dessert which was probably the best id ever had
now i have a box full of leftovers
let me warn you that beer only makes the flames rise higher so bring a cup of sweet tea with you to protect your mouth
the staff is always courteous and helpful and seem to be having a good time
waiters kept my cup full and the complimentary chips  salsa flowing
they were even nice enough to let us stay through the change and into lunch which i was told would normally be an additional cost
yeah i think id come back if in the area
the soup of the day was egg drop soup with thin crackersit was well balanced in flavor and lacked any of the raw after taste that often comes with egg drop soup
im not a huge bacon jam fan but i definitely liked these better than the ones at the asbury
oh before i forget try their onion rings really crunchy and yummy
the worst service ever
we ordered the boteco board with the cheese and meats the gorditas hummus braised beef and two flights of wine
i know other people use the same plates and silverware im using but things like that especially when noticed are offputting
had a late lunch in mesa az at charlestons
we made a reservation at olives  6 pm knowing that we might have to wait to sit outside since we were told  we cant request itweird but not my business
we love the food here and are so happy that they opened their henderson location so we didnt have to hike all the way up to unlv to get some of their good eats
the tacos come plain and then you pack them with toppings from their fabulous salsa bar that has everything that you could ever want on your taco
when at the store she was told that they didnt have her food order and after waitng 30 minutes they wouldnt be able to get her any food for another 45 minutes to an hour
im sure ill be back to this place again due to my nowresidency in lakewood and proclivity for craft beers but it did not blow my mind at all on this maiden voyage
while ive been here multiple times since it opened ive been holding off reviewing mostly because of the politics
a mixed market vegetable dish which was good but i wouldnt recommend it unless you love tofu
while i cant consider myself a pho connoisseur i have been to golden turtle several times with friends and have never been disappointed
the flavors were good the rice was good cucumbers were crisp ca rolls had imitation crab etc it was pleasant but not the best
it was worth a shot
its very clean and pretty organized
overall i did not think giada was a value i know its vegas but it was a wednesday night and i think maybe the b team was on in the kitchen
a few years ago we had a bad experience at the mighty oak barrel and swore never to go back
im not sure i would go back again before a game though
we took a chance as the yelp reviews avg 3 12 stars either loved or hated the place
bar is full of seniors getting half price appetizers some just ordering water or one drink serverbartender has to spend all their time on the typical seniors demands while the customers that want drinks and food suffer
returned several times during our trip in the wee hrs of the morning each time we found great food great service excellent pancakes
my recommendation would be to start the band early like to you did but maybe hold off on increasing the sound in the front bar until about an hour later
open about 6 months and will definitely be a regular for us
this was where we went all the time
eggs were to be over well were really runny and went all over the plate
second it seems like their oven isnt hot enough because the crust wasnt that nice crispy almost burned brown that i love
so they got my food ready quick and i could have swore the salmon combo was supposed to come with 56 pieces of sashimi
had the worst birthday experience today
thats a freakin steal
the great thing about the location is that you can go eat and the service is usually so fast you can still settle the check and go out for a stroll in the park all within your lunch hour
mussels has more red onions than mussels
back again today for greek fries and traditional gyro
bad service bad food
this place is awesome
the waffles have a nice vanilla favour to it
paramount is amazing
it wasnt directly the pizzas fault but indirectly
everyone who works there is super friendly and very welcoming
but the most important thing  the food
salads fruits pot pies shrimp  grits then fresh baked desserts to blow your diet
make reservations for sure
i came here for dinner on a saturday night with my parents
by nickle and dime i mean 1 or 2 per topping for small or large calzones respectively
we picked w burger bar since we were in that vicinity
both were equally delicious
if i could give this place more than five stars i would i mean i really would
definately get the pretzles and the burger though
my fave cut of meat was the ribeye followed closely behind by the sirloin
it was also obvious that the carlos bread had been made fresh that morning
lady that usually works register n wears glasses very friendly assisted me with the app now im basically a capaddict
we came in with a large party of 2025 people
wine was fine and soup was tasty waiter also delivered some bread and antipasta
i left without my food
cant beat that
yes they serve cake pops
also the main dining room has terrible acoustics and is really loud when it is crowded
not a gastropub
the breadfruits mixed drinks are for people with a particular affinity for rum
i think if you havent been there and are at the san tan mall shopping that its worth a visit
but it was clean and the staff were friendly service was prompt
three restless nights in a row had me pretty bitter by the end of the stay
under 10 gets you two entrees a starch option two veg springs rolls and a small drink  and you can get out for less even when i started visiting the stand alone locations or hitting the drivethrus on my travels elsewhere  every time it was fairly consistent flavors good customer service and full portions so im not sure what is going on at this location
the sweet and sour salad was delicious as were the sliders and hummus
will definitely come again when in the mood for premade chicken
i can respect their concept but when they are too strict with their rules they take the fun out of eating a donut
i went with a party of 10 for a birthday having been told well in advance that we could by no means stay more than an hour and a half due to other reservations
one look at the bottle and i knew i was gonna need a third mortgage to pay for it
i never imagined i would like sushi
im from the east coast and we have amazing sandwiches you cant get out west but as far as burgers go nothing compares
ordered the catfish sandwich  slaw  a large sweet tea
i didnt think id care for the dry rub but its got a sweet hickory smokey taste that is really well put together
they were out of chicken noodle soup unfortunately
jason also took time to make sure everything was going how it should which of course it was
do try this place
my boyfriend ordered the house cut filet mignon rare with asparagus and a sweet potato
well not after you called it out at the whole table like that
photos on the walls of celebrities who have eaten here
man hat sich zeit genommen mir und meiner freundin typische thailndische spezialitten nher zu bringen und gab uns ntzliche tipps fr die thailandreise
make a reservation ahead of time and dont be more than 5 minutes late or theyll cancel it
great for breakfast or lunch
as waitress handed me the menu i advised i already knew what i wanted
lunch  burger and sweet potato fries
this was my first time here and salut was absolutely phenomenal
note  the reason for 4 stars is due to the fact that our server mixed up our togo containers  yuck
the aguachilie was very yummy
i enjoyed the peanut butter chicken served with sweet crispy spinach
the only downfall about this place is that me and my friends found hair in our food and one of our friends got food poisoning
so the kids could not play15 minutes passed and they were still 3 orders away from mines plus a line in the drive thru
i had the club clover which was so very sour  didnt taste good at all
we came here for breakfast and coffee and were very satisfied with our short stay
they do have daily specials in addition to the crepes but they were all soldout by the time i arrived
neither impressing nor disappointing
love their food the ambience and the friendly staff
very impressed with this restaurant
my new favourite keg restaurant
recommended for those who like citrus
yay for having a vegetarian soup
tip entrance is in the back
prime location at queen st w and spadina love the area so much good food
pricing is great and people here are friendly
some tables appear to be mounted on the rolling undercarriage that you would see on a mine car
now one of my favorite buffets in las vegas
probably the best ive had in the burgh for sure
i went with my boyfriend and another couple last night
looking forward to going again when in az
theyve recently renovated and moved again used to be near bulk barn and are now located in between the entrance to the lower level of walmart and td bank
breathtaking view and experience with mediocre food
longer story short this manager who originally came off as if he gave a crap basically told me im not gonna do the right thing which would have been to just refund me my money and move on
i went there with a date and had westlake beef soup singapore rice noodle and moo goo gai pan
this place was swamped had several large parties and our table of four was still finished within and hour and 15 our waitress disappeared a few times but that wasnt unexpected given how busy it was
the pastrami and cheese was waaaay too salty and i eat a lot of salt
while owens still holds my heart when it comes to crazy bagel sandwiches poppys is a solid alternate option that i will be visiting again very soon
did i mention im cheap
its conveniently located in crystals shopping center and is close to other cool spots like the cosmopolitan and the aria
cant ever go wrong with that
it is difficult to clearly define esan cooking since many of those native dishes like papaya salad and larb are common on many thai menus
everything here is great
it is way better then raising canes they have the option to get your chicken cook either baked fried or grills and the mac n cheese is to die for
there seems to be a good selection of olive oils and balsamic vinegars which i cant wait to try
only downside was no complementary bread but thats not a big deal overall i would definitely recommend mama ricottas to anyone
the lamb shwarma was fabulous
just tried burghs wings  pizza last night
came with a side of rice beans guacamole and veggies
the sweet iced tea my sister ordered cant remember which flavor was the best ive ever tasted
my husband is a sushi man and he said that is was very very dry
i also hate that ill end up manipulating my way into or having my opinion manipulated by a comped check yet this was such an incredibly embarrassing and infuriating waste of time that i was outraged by the 9 discount they offered for me my trouble
i will try the  next time
even though they did charge the 20 gratuity food was delicious but super slow
i luh me sum waffle house
went to cafe el dorado simply because we didnt have the 45 minutes to wait in line at lavenue which is a delicious breakfast place right across the street
they dimmed the lights and killed the basketball to put ufc on every tv
all of their games are nice and new and they rarely have games that are out of order
not the way id want my business ran
i would definitely go back even if she was not with me
the ladies are work there are very kind and try their best to cater to you even when busy
all their dishes are so refreshing and yummy
my only gripe is that after i had ordered and sat down to wait for my food a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus with actual descriptions of the menu items im sure unlike the chalkboard on the wall which i would have liked
not sure how they are still in business
this is a small place tucked away from the neons of the fremont street
i split the traditional pasty and chocolate bread desert with my husband
bar staff was pretty nice and helpful get there early for a seat the place fills up pretty quick
half the time the breading got left behind in the mayo
youd think pies this big wouldnt be cooke properly and may be rawdoughy
great wine and beer selection
awesome food and atmosphere
the curd is about as fresh as you can get outside of quebec so no squeak but i dont mind
also ask for their hot sauce
overall ill never go back
we ordered twice more before calling it a night
though really i could easily use about 6 of them in one sitting
but the good thing is turnover is fast
it was slow service but spot on considering all the other people that she had to handle
they got a liquor license
the staff learn your name by the second or third visit the food is served rather quickly even on the one time i went when it was quite busy the taste of the food was excellent the selection of beers available was really good plus they had some that are not available at other places weve been to which my husband loved i dont drink alcohol all at a reasonable price the bill for 2 people there rarely comes to over 30 and usually around 25
jtais rentr sans grandes attentes et jen suis ressortis vraiment satisfait une nouvelle rfrence en la matire de sushi
this is definitely the place to go if you want to sit around with friends or family and have a great burger
after finishing our meal the server who i believe was also the owner made us wait for about 20 mins after we said we were done to bring us our bill
and children running the show
i guess i know how to clear a room
weve probably ordered from here about 30 times and have never been disappointedwe still cant remember the proper names to order and they are always patient and get it right
theyre fast even though were in squirrel hill and theyre in oakland and sorry larry  carols open super late
an upscale restaurant like this you would expect something more appropriate
the food was just ok not great and the waiter was terrible acted like he had somewhere else to be every time he came by but the other employees were good
i personally only go here if someone invites me who is already there
le riz frit au poulet fait la job
theyre doing their own marketing creating their own vibe and successful in their efforts so far
we had a group of over 15 people and they never made us wait too long for anything we asked forwe asked for a lot too
the manager came to our table to apologize for the wait and told us the pizza was a little burned on bottom and they were remaking the pizza and he offered us a free desert
when its my turn i order a half dozen bagels and a single serve side of butter
i really enjoy this place
i started with steamed clams that werent huge but they were soo good
we had a great dinner outside at one
it sounds like servers come first rather then customer experience
the bartender was friendly  attentive
i didnt even like the rice or macaroni salad
it isnt a bad meatball but it isnt good either
look its a buffet so there cant be too much to say about it
definitely a perk for a fridaysaturday
every time i eat here i end up with no more fish and all rice and toppings
if youre coming here you must get the korean fusion dogs
he was plain crass and he didnt seem to really care much about our experience at all
there is limited parking out front usually taken by customers for the adjacent starbucks but theres an additional lot to the right
for the two stooges i have a excerpt from a famous malcom x speech who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet
ive had dinner here many times
i could drink canucks all day and all night and be happy forever
the customer service is the best and i felt like they were always there right when i needed them
both excellent but watch how hot you want it
went here with my girls for a sushi craving
they have huge salads that are great a variety or small plates to share and great enters
went again this week and had another great visit
next time well try the pasta
not the best ive had but definitely decent enough to accompany and break up the meat fest
ranks up there with the best dim dum houses weve been to in san francisco seattle and nyc
our waiter highly recommended it and described it with such passion that i could almost taste it
this place is great
i went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw tomato french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as i finished the second half
most recently hubs and i joined bil and soon to be sil for dinner on a friday night during lent
i will just need to remember to sneak my own in
we came around 23pm so the presentation of the food did not look as appetizing not fresh
cowboy ciao is known for the chopped salad
i had one stuffed with dates nutella and i believe walnuts the thing was huge and delicious and about 8
jest went here today very busy place but we were seated immediately
food running around the restaurant trying to order offthewall hasnt been easy or successful
i ordered a fall spiced latte with almond milk
the selection of pastries is remarkable with both sweet and savoury options thank you
if you like thai food spiced the right way then this is the place
a young lady who looked a bit overwhelmed running around trying to do 10 things at once
theres a real sense of occasion when you take afternoon tea at colonnades  as you walk through the hall the main room opens up before you with beautiful corinthian columns towering above diners and old books lining the walls and galleries handwoven carpets and mirrored tables reflecting the ceiling detail
like many others the drinks are good but i am reviewing the drinks
the food was good but pales in comparison to the buffet at the wynn
i ordered the turkey wrap with the house made chips and it too was tasty
i have not had a frankfurter like this since the last time i traveled to germany
staff are average
i am a fan of the carne asada burrito and the guac is pretty good
and only has 8 rings in it
i really hope this was an anomaly because it was a terrible first impression to make
this is one of my favorite restaurants in montreal and possibly one of the more underappreciated if considering quality of food and nice atmosphere
for me a good fo soup has a tasty stock and ample bread and cheese
they have daily specials selected mexican items that comes in a combo which means in mexican terms beans and rice   complimentary chips and salsa if you choose the dinein option
thank you rustic cafe for your great service and tastefully done breakfast
place is trendy yet a bit small and somewhat crammed especially at the back i guess thats what gives it the japanese feel
never ever eat here
in fact everything might be overpriced  la carte so just order your pancakes and go on your way
we spent about 140 on dinner
there were a list of different meats to get like chorizo beef head tongue  pork etc
our server was so nice and helpful in answering the questions we had
the soft drinks came in 8oz coke bottles
i was dinning with two friends and one of them eats at mcdonalds regularly so his udon was the greatest thing ever
the interiors though leaves a lot to be desired they have this partfunny partscary looking plastic skull fitted with reindeer party horns at one corner
after going to the restaurant and very respectively asking for this to be fixed the manager chuckled in my face and said all your getting is a refund
we went here for our anniversary and i couldnt believe how great the sushi was in arizona
the service was excellent and the food came promptly
i enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying a nice breeze
was a good local place but really 14 for a dozen wings too many places in a mile radius with atmosphere
its your typical american style chinese food but its well prepared and very reasonably priced
and no moez the sandwiches have just the right amazing delicious amount of oil
all of their staff are also super friendly and seem to be fairly knowledgeable about what they serve
this is when the problems started to occur
hes super awesome with a beard of a legend
fire cracker burger was delicious
but all in all it comes down to the ice cream
those pies were so delicious piled thick with fresh toppings and perfectly baked
you donta likea my rules you takea you business somewhere else
the burrito was bland and not filling
it was absolutely delicious and the service was very friendly and great
i also tried the polish dog and again it was excessively greasy the sauteed onions were drenched in oil but the sausage itself was pretty good
ate here this past weekend for mine and my best friends birthday
went here tonight with my wife as we had a coupon from restaurantcom
salad was really great antipasto
i thought the experience was pretty cool perhaps ghoulishly cool
lunch special is 2 slicesdrink for 726 after taxgreat value
i liked my salad better than the greekish one at the bar and grill  fewer ingredients kept the flavours from being lost perhaps
unless hubby really craves those awesome tacos one of these days
weve been at this place at least 78 times and it never disappoints
its very well priced and the staff are very friendly
the eggplant was so juicy and filling while the dips were extraordinary
i have tried the garlic butter and the lemon pepper seasonings
the place never is crowded which always surprises me
im too hesitant to order any food item here
they have almond milk too
i was surprised to see some of the bad reviews until i read them
i would have ordered a cocktail or glass of wine to go with my drink however there was no drinks menu readily available
great atmosphere and excellent service too
it gave me the opportunity to reconnect with friends and try a new place for my yelp reviews
all in all  i really really really hope they had an off night
the portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor
definitely take a hot date there
they were extremely informative quick and helpful
salty eggs sausages bacon  toast  refillable coffee
we get our food patronizing 4 different trucks and try to find a seat
live scallop again thanks bobby  live uni i really didnt want to try this but javi applied adventurous peer pressure  spicy albacore w fried onions i mentioned it eric just whipped it up and gave us a 4 piece sample gratis  garlic edamame   spicy tuna rolls  eric bought us a bottle of sake javi  i sorta celebrating birthdays  yelp check in for a free bottle of sake  patrons at the bar tend to share food  eric ftw
fourth time i will say i was disappointed in both the food and service
man sushi was ok
their counter space was very organized and i watched him make it and toast the bun
outback loves me
way across town from where i live but i went there for the ambiance and food
so i took a seat and waited for about 1015 to receive my sandwich
they wouldnt sell it to me
they have great lunch specials too
two four star ratings two five star ratings
ive never left a restaurant because i was ignored
oh when i said i was picking up for mikethey all went mikes here
second course  trio of sliders
also you have to order the cheese popovers
their bread is exemplary served with rich butter topped with flakes of salt
expect to wait for a seat at this spunky little fish joint
great spot to check out if youre in the area particularly if youre here for the court house at the convention center
so thumbs up all around
so we have some friends who live on the east side and one of them had a surprise birthday party for her husband last saturday at jekylls
but this is place has definitely improved in the past couple of years
intimate elegant but pricey restaurant
the staff was excellent very accommodating without being overbearing
it had a bit of a food court feeling which is a first in this plaza
not a huge selection but they have some sort of peach jelly sake that i could easily see myself becoming an alcoholic for  it tasted like real peaches not the artificial flavors you might get in peach schnapps or whatnot
its been 40 minutes meanwhile everyone else is halfway done with there meal ok again terrible service
the hot shots were ok the fries looked like someone sneezed some cheese on them and the wings were luke warm
a tasty tender and intense juicy and flavorful the cilantro  jalapeno fused a flavor behavior that was truly out of this world
fast forward to next week
to which started an avalanche of drinks and tacos
if the prices are more reasonable i bump this to 4 stars
i didnt even have time to tell her add extra oil
very friendly hostessesservers clean tables and rarely ever a wait over ten minutes even for this tiny location
had something tomato in them bc they reminded me of italian food for some reason lol coconut shrimp pretty average
everything else is a la carte
the third crme brulee was flavored with some liqueur that i cant remember but i found it bitter and only had one bite
i was not impressed with any of the rolls at all and fish did not taste fresh at all
definitely recommend it
theyre new but will most likely last
this is therefore my reason for only 4 stars
i absolutely loved this place i had heard so much about this place in the last couple of weeks having relocated here from california i know a thing or two about good tacos i was a bit reluctant to believe the this place was as good as people said
very nice open air location in the shops at crystals
coffee was soso im not expecting designer coffee but at least flavor other than coffee grinds
lots of options and you will definitely be full
it was a recommended resturant from a local that i work with
i recommend anyone who is craving tacos go go here
i was incredibly underwhelmed by quality complexity and ingenuity of the options
i love you chef julian serrano
oh and the worst luke warm stale coffee
it wouldnt of been an issue if she actually checked on us but she didnt and thats disappointing for a slow thursday night
those babies were huge
too our surprise this establishment offers neither
if you want to have some german food this is the place to go
on a monday afternoon we ordered pho well done beef and combination vermicelli for 3 used the 8 groupon for 16  da lat is a city in the southern part of vietnam  dirty tables but friendly service
so glad we have a spot nearby to satisfy cravings for bahn mi ramen pho boba and other awesome fishes
and youd think that a cup of strong turkish coffee would have had me bouncing off the walls for the rest of the day
hopefully they can get it together and figure out how to retain the right tenants
amazing food relaxed atmosphere
it was really good together the salty chicken and the sweet syrup with the soft waffle actual went very well together
i havent been overwhelmed by the mains and usually end up ordering an appetizer or two instead
the staff is very friendly and the food is fresh
the menu mainly consist of burgers hotdogs chili fries and shakes
we were greeted by all the people that worked there with a smile and a welcome so thats awesome
der service war nett wirkte aber ein wenig zerstreut und berfordert mit relativ wenigen gsten
but seriously the burger alone wasnt worth the visit to schoops
in addition to the typical tomato and cucumbers there was a super slaw and spinach and feta cheese
highly recommended make sure to make a reservation before you go
even ignoring the value it has the best bbq in matthewsstallingsindian trail
pizza calabrese is my favorite if you like spicy
food is good priced decently
4 my friend is a picky eater so she ordered chicken garlic alfredo with different noddles extra sauce
but a better than room service alternative if youre staying at the wynncore
much better flavors than the traditional mai tai
we walked in and realized it was a fast food style but the owner im assuming served is as though it was a sit down style and took our order
im coming back here often for sure
again good texture  i liked that the garlic wasnt overpowering
well that was a mistake
so when i received my bill and noticed that it had a 15 charge for my coke i felt a little scammed
they have happy hour specials from 57 which include half price appetizers and beer and drink specials
the food was fresh and flavorful with good portion sizes
both were excellent
all in all it felt like a wee spot of scotland in toronto and it was an enjoyable brunch
waitress is awesome and so upbeat
the service was lackluster and they were under staffed we got our food quickly but had to wait about 15 minutes for our bill and another 5 for the debit machine
the restaurant has a cheesy but effective mexican themed decor with black and white prints of the likes of pancho villa adorning the walls
i got the red curry beef and red curry is the first dish i try to order at thai places to test their tastiness
this is easily one of my favorite places in vegas
they have a huge outdoor patio
they didnt offer a discount or anything for messing up the order or for our wait
i tried a double kimichi burger with a side of fries
its a cool place to be on the weekend and my wife still enjoy going there
i was very excited about the bacchanal but unfortunately found it very underwhelming
wir waren schon hufiger im haus des sultans in der rotebhlstrasse mittags und abends
staff is friendly food is fresh and above average
people its thin crust pizza
okay bad pun aside he had a great humor and was very considerate to our needs
maybe he was in the weeds
which one are you
i love the chicken egg rolls
had to flag down a server for coffee after being there half an hour
got the pork souvlaki platter for 745
the staff was nice and as i said welcoming of a family with kids which is always nice
everyone was extremely knowledgeable with its dishes and ingredients
other then that good job getting the food portions and standards back to where they were when you first opened
our waitress was not attentive if she was even awake at all
its a bar
the food was good we ordered the buttered squid this is a must try
food was excellent and unique
a place with over 300 reviews a favorite of many people on yelp and i finally make my first visit
try pita jungle perhaps slow but a big menu and they do takeout if you call ahead
cant go wrong here
not to mention the waiter that came with a pitcher of iced tea to fill up my coke
good sized portions not overly pricey
def give this one a go
i would def give this place another try but for now i give it 3 stars
since they are only really busy during a short dinner period they always tried to rush you out and turn over as many tables as possible to maximize their income
the only bad thing was the service very slow other than that i would have gave them 5 stars
the downside the service is awful
i had seen some reviews mentioning that it gets super busy at lunch time they also dont take reservations at lunch so my friend and i ordered take out through their app
perfect ending to a fantastic brunch
auf sonderwnsche wird nicht eingegangen das kristallweizen wurde trotz wunsch mit einer zitronenscheibe gebracht
wrapping is paper thin
when you ask for more they charge you money
i went there for lunch and they said that i was suppose to get two fried pork chops but they only giving me one cause the pork chop was a big one
even the big claw meat pieces were lacking the big lobster flavour i expected
for me that garage seems a lot easier to access and its almost never full either
i dont think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974 its not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time
it was good but i have had better
dont ask me why or how but their pepsi tastes different and better than any other place ive ever been to
quality is slipping here people
service was quick and friendly enough
not complicated streamline
second time here and this visit was really goodwhat i liked is that  they gave us a decanter of tea and the chips salsas and bean dip was good
a must try
then we had to find him again to pick it up
i was expecting the sales people to be uppity or judgmental especially after seeing the valet parking and the greeter guy wearing black patent shoes and a top hat but surprisingly i was wrong
we were seated immediately and everyone was surprised by how busy the restaurant was
pork fried rice
i look forward to stopping in again
you can pass intestinal worms that way
just a great place
so far best grilled chicken sandwich i have ever had as well as the best fries ever
les pizzas ne sont pas trs dispendieuses par rapport  la qualit servie dans votre assiette
i also really like the patio area too
wow i was blown away by the tin kitchen after finally tracking down this food truckdefinitely as good as a brick and mortar restaurant
i will admit that depending on what you order the food can be a bit on the greasy side but it is so damn good
we started off with zucchini flowers  wasnt really feeling the lemon with the ricotta with the zucchini flowerok dish app at best arancini  goodalmost if not better than noras arancini charcuterie  is there really such a thing as a bad charcuterie plate
it was an expensive 16 bowl of noodle with zero souls
cant say enough
try the california roll poke style
could have eaten one more if not for my bursting stomach my food highlights  crab fire and ice seviche tres leches cake my food disappointments  lack of seviche options i dont know if i will make it here with an empty stomach but definitely for some drinks and dessert
nice neighbourhood japanese restaurant
nice service and clean place
everything is super fresh and beautiful looking
my boyfriend opted for a toffee muffin i had the caramel shortbread
food was wrong
the seafood combo at ll barbecue is approximately 450 less
food was really good
if youre in the mood for a good burger youll find it at bad daddys
ill probably wait a while before i go back
our server never once stopped back to ask how our meal was going
jam packed for fish fry on friday
the french press is  a must try
stopped in for lunch and had the crawfish flatbread
s across the nation that we have visited the quality is surprisingly similar
service was fine
my families vote was to get pizza somewhere else next time
ill probably try the chicken which my friends like but other than that i dont have a compelling reason to return
bouchon im thinking of you
service was also great
one of the few beers on tap was out and we were mystified as we watched our server pour soft drinks and mixers from 2liter bottles
though i havent tried their pastries and desserts they look amazing
it is sooooo slow
i cant believe we havent been here earlier
my friend and i put away several beers before we called it a day
bringing friends and family again hopefully will get ashley again
theres loads of tables although on busier daysnights he smallish kitchen struggles to keep up with demand so be prepared to wait and spaces for those members of the buggy brigade
excellent coffee friendly people
sad to see a good mexican place in town go down hill
good place to study or sit down and have a good kibitz
we enjoyed the fish and chips fish tacos and burgers
all in all it was a yummy experience and i would definitely recommend it to others
the room itself is kinda cool but you can totally tell it is their officeconference room thingy
they also have great drink specials
i will return to try the other vegetarian dishes
i continue to be disappointed about the menu but the location and ambiance is great
we paid the bill after the desserts and as we were getting up our neighbors got their entrees
my husband loves that he can watch sports on their big screens while were enjoying sunday brunch after church
also the desserts are amazing
i first tried the meat and cheese plate while drinking beer at banger brewing expecting a little snack
both have owners and staff who are like 110 years old but make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive
just one last comment on the decorits veryeclectic and hipster
they didnt have any breakfast tacos
glad we did
my brother was sick for three days
this is my second time at casa filipina
everything about kismot was excellent
suffice to say i was overwhelmed with excitement by these bold claims until i had to remind myself that the best of california really isnt all that great at least from my ramen experiences in la
i had eaten at the kai and had an outstanding experience more than once so when i found out it was the same chef i was very excited
lobster bi bim bap 15 unfortunately i wasnt fast enough to snap a picture before our server started mixing the rice
i the the food was really good the only complaint was the shrimp dish seemed a little overpriced at 1395
i really wanted to love this place but didnt
the kabob was super juicy and they are very generous on the meat portion
id probably go back  if im in the neighborhood
this place is more trendy than substance
i could easily see a drunk person throwing a burning marshmallow on another person
hummus appetizer wasnt anything special and pita bead was a bit soggy
they are not that but pretty close especially given that they are in a casino in las vegas
if you like veal you gotta try the house veal cutlet martorano
the food was great taste and presentation wise
our food was jam packed with veggies and chicken
420 is a wonderful eastside hidden gem
i am impressed that they make their taro paste from fresh taro
i could look over this one time but it has happened every time that we have ordered the hibachi along with our sushi
the food is delicious n the service is fast
so far have tried the  mimosa bellini french toast eggs benedict spicy meatballs  all were on point
could be upgraded to a 4 star when they get their service straightened out
the sandwiches are amazing
id come back again if i were in the area
my husband and i are drastically changing our diets and searched high and low in vegas for some healthy choices
this place is amazing
i had to give the chicken skrewer and the kabobs to my dog who no doubt liked it
i noticed they have specials throughout the week sake  saporo for 399 on monday 1 sushi on tuesdays as well as 1 oysters on thursdays
good job bk
yummm sake bombs for happy hour anyone
das essen die mitarbeiter und die atmosphre sind absolut top
went for brunch but ended up ordering from the grilled cheese list
are you kidding me
this place is insanely good
the fries are really doughy and they taste very homemade in the best way possible
it kind of makes you want to pretend you live in the 70s are roughly eight years old have a shaggy bowl cut and a striped sweater tucked into your bell bottoms in a completely nostalgic way
honestly so amazing
remarkable preparation of the escargots flavours galore nicely grilled steak and those skinny amazing fries dipped in garlic mayo
they have a ton of local brews available
no one actually wants to eat a pile of raw onions buried under globs of mucousy greek dressing
i had things like a compressed watermelon salad a cheese tray with handmade crisps and scallops in a wonderful bed of vegetables
it came with a variety of vegetable pieces which were seasoned simply but tasted quite good
warning go elsewhere if your looking for a good burger or just a decent burger
talk about passion
came here on friday night for a feast with the pork bone soup the pork belly sharing plate and the sausage thing
the gyozas were yum as well as the octopus balls
we highly recommend this place
had the wild sage burger and i must say it is one of the best burgers ive had in a long time
the salmon was well done as were the beans and rice
a real unique experience with a interesting asian fusion meal
ive been here several times and the food has always been excellent  interesting and worth the calories
scallops and shorts ribs as mains again very popular
what a joke
filet was one of the worst steaks ive ever eaten
my friends and i use to go all the time after a long day to happy hour from 123 am the bartender before was a douche but at least he would make our drinks and get shit done so it was whatever
they even charge for dipping sauce for your fries other than ketchup obviously
we placed our order for a party of 4 received and ate half of our orders and our drink orders had still not shown up
service was excellent
i also ordered the oak roasted chicken dinner
i like this place
this is what raw vegan food should taste like
what the hmmm
i loved the combination of flavors
definitely worth this visit
i would say that this outlet has a lot of the premium brand outlets that most people would be looking for although i thought this place was total crap
this was recommended by the hotel staff and they didnt let them down
plus they gave me one of the menus when i asked if they had a take home version
so she filled up my water glass and then proceeded to fill up my other glasswtf
im a pepe 1 awesome ham and provolone cheese with just lettuce tomato and mayo its divine
no pink in the middle for us
their breakfast menu for pickup or sit down is good too
i waited about 9 months to attend the carlos santana show last saturday night at hob vegas
from our bartender bella the gereral manager karsten manager bank
service was good although it did take them a while to give us water and our coffees
the restaurant had an upscale vibe to it and an okay ambience overall
we got both
i have visited for weekend brunch and also for dinner
anyone who disagrees is misguided d
so we ducked into tuttos
forse la migliore pizza mangiata allestero e anche in italia
sorry not coming here again
this one definitely deserve 5 stars
i also tried the biscuits and gravy
the way the bouncer was monitoring who did and did not get in was absolutely absurd
this was another great experience at epic
i only wish they had a seafood gumbo with crab and shrimp
the food is always delicious however the service is always slowww and missing in action
the food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is always courteous and quick
one bad drawback about this place is that every once in a while you have a random person roaming around asking if you want to buy drugs off them
what i also really love about the place is its equally good for a date or for a large party
we were too drunk to notice how long it was taking until the food was almost out
food is mediocre at a high price
the chicken caesar salad is  huge and could feed 3 people
however because of their special that was announced on yelp this week i got 50 off my meal
it gets cramped when youre waiting but otherwise being a sushi snob this is the only place i like to go to when i want ayce
big chunks of fresh mozzarella avocado and then a chopped up tomato basil mixture served with pita chips
they also do take away so if you feel like sushi but in pjs you can call in your order and come pick it up
for food we shared  kanapki  pierogi  horse  pepper sandwich verdict  kanapki were very good and each were unique
however im not quite convinced that its my loss  it had been almost a year since my original visit to breadfruit which did not overwhelm as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back but i did have an appreciation of the option for caribbean cuisine
only thing missing cocktails
im all for the success of small businesses esp
this is a place that you will either love or hate
you just have to be patient and wait if you planning to eat here lunch time
when the waiter came back to ask how the food was thankfully just a couple of minutes later us being already irate my date answered this boudin tastes like shit
maybe theyll bring it back somedaycan you hear me pita jungle
we kept saying no
it has an interesting texture ive never felt before
great for large gatherings
makes you wonder why mcdonalds ever stopped frying in lard
theres just no other way to put it
for dinner i had the fish special and it was amazing
service there were about 3 hostesses at the time who seated us immediately
this is when i really got pissed off
the pretty spot is staffed with vintagewearing young servers and hosts and when i went there i really liked the relaxed laidback vibe and the food
i asked for the milestones trio lunch with garden salad i specifically said no caesar salad when i ordered
the restaurant is very small with only around 10 twoperson tables
my chicken had beautifully crispy skin
05 rating overall
as someone who lived in brook park i am familiar with the other the place to be on smith rd also a former employee with nothing but amazing things to say but had never found my way to the original location
secretly i convinced myself it was just a product of a dinner rush
the people who reviewed this saying it tastes like panda must be having the best panda in the country cause this is miles above any panda ive tasted
the meatballs were very savory and the maultaschen were great
i got the fried chicken and switched the baked potato for frites because lets be real who can resist frites
i went to bangkok and loved the papaya salad
we shared charcuterie and a few other dishes and each tasted different and were excellent
when i am in the mood for donkatsu this will be the place
nice clean friendly dinerice cream shop all rolled into one
on the label of the juices it says to consume the juice within 5 days of purchase but as we inspect the bottles half of the bottles have an expiration date of 5 days from today 22014 and half have an expiration date of today 21514
i would go there literally and day between sunday  wednesday stay away on weekend nights this place gets slammed and youll be lucky to find any parking and lines are super long
40 stars for the service
vino rosso is definitely my favorite restaurant in town
were eager to hit them up for the weekday half price taco special sometime since that seems like the best deal in charlotte
korean beef tacos were laughable as others have commented
there is a continuous pressure on selling more even while youre still eating yet never enough time to bring water or even refill glasses
i debated about giving this place 5stars  the wraps are great quality is valued and the manager is among the handful of people that ive met that i would headhunt to spearhead johnson heavy industries whenever that becomes a thing and hell join an elite team of ruthless efficiency consisting of a few waiters a cab driver an amplifier builder a software engineer and an accountant once i figure out how i can utilize these folks all in one business
did i mention how expensive this place is
the 3 course dinner was ok would i do it again no
the general manager came right to our table
but when comings with the other ingredients on the plate it was better but did failed to deliver a wow factor for a main course
i like my french toast with a side of stella artois
i am a sucker for their salsa at elmers
she is the best thing to ever happen to me
i highly recommend the three little pigs sandwich or hudson valley duck
and added insult to injury by his disgusting behavior
i wont be back
yummy affordable fun clean and the staff is very friendly
the black cod was also delicious with a miso glaze practically melted in your mouth
next time tho
the only negative was the price was a little high for the restaurant
how could i go wrong
i mark a good mexican restaurant by how well they make their chile rellenos  this one had the seeds still in it
they were pretty darn good
dont even get me going on their prices
however for 25 for a pizza and wings i expect something better than little ceasars
there are plenty of options on the menu for everyone from burgers to a sizable new york strip
i paid 895 per pair for these bought two pairs which didnt seem that bad for the strip
daniel our waiter was superb
diffidently the largest slice i have seen on the strip
every time ive been here the salad has been a bit less than palatable because it sat somewhere warm before being brought to me
i love they use fresh spices and not the dried ones we are accustomed to
the pain created after was not worth this food
amazing food and service
the waitress was rude and the food was way to expensive
when he did she was attentive without being intrusive sweet helped make suggestions and overall made the night such a great experience that this will be my go to spot in las vegas
they dont have as many beers on offer as say le saint bock but what they do have is pretty decent i particularly love their flights which focus around regions czechstyle for example and they have a great casual atmosphere with plenty of seating for singles large groups and everyone in between
granted ive had better in hawaii  some other costal cities but not in the cleveland area
i was craving something nacho cheese esque
the prime rib was cooked to my liking and the mushrooms were delicious as well
came here on a sunday
it was adequate and fresh but i found the flavor a little lacking
everything you want in a diner and more
their roulette minimums were 10 when other comparable casinos would be at 5 or less minimums
i have never had my chinese orders come without these simple things
i have been to this one at least 8 times to give them a fair shake
listen im not hating on hamburger helper but its not exactly what i want when i go to an upscale bar for happy hour
her response was to check to see if they had any so she could offer it to me for free when she found out it they were out she asked if there was anything else i wanted to try
service  though the staff is nice they are very slow and at times neglectful
in my experience their steaks seem to be very good the burgers are awesome and the meatloaf is excellent
guess they have a 499 steak deal on wednesdays which also requires a 2 drink purchase
steak chicken shrimp and pasta
die tischdecken sollten generell nach jedem gast ausgetauscht werden
the pickle bar is different basically different types of sliced pickles you can help yourself too garlic jalapeno tony packo typeetc
always good friendly service ok plain food nice clean atmosphere
if you like chili dogs the sloppy dog is a feast with great chili
came in late on a weekday and was greeted by a nice bartender
in terms of setting it is a pretty typical hk style cafe bustling busy loud and run by chinese housewives si lais who really dont care for their quality of service
went with a large group they added 16 for the tip for me and did not give me my 25 discount
this stuff was like pizza dough with the worst chees and garlic spreadughi love bread and i could barely down this the one star is for service which was very goodbut the place was almost empty so why not
there are ways a waiter can suss out what kind of knowledge the diner has about a product being presented
but maybe try one of those chocolate mousses instead of anything cakebased
great wine great service great food and great ambiance
let me put it this way i have eaten here about 3 times in the past four years and after my last time well it is going to stay the last time
nothing hot or ready
bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar
i wanted to eat lunch and this place has lunch specials for about 89 depending on what you get
no comment on the food since i did not get to try any
they were not runny and not too thick excellent
the decor is 1970s rec room
it took another 5 minutes before we were acknowledged by our waitress
food was its usual greatness
fast friendly service
5 stars all the way
i hope no one slips
52 bucks for 2 rather small plates and 2 margaritas that we didnt even touch
portions pasta portions are just enough
cindy was my server
this one is a little tired
great exquisite presentation  i ordered 1 agedashi and raku tofu half and half
i loveeee hand pulled noodles
thats right only one scoop
i ordered three salads total
we added bacon to it bringing it up to 6 for a small salad with store bought ranch
each food item is properly described for those of us that are not familiar with asian foodsterms
sadly thats what im going to remember most about this visit not the food
we were a party of five
showed up here on a thursday night starving to see a line practically out the door
especially for the price
dont even bother its full of terrible service cold food and snotty managers that dont follow up on complaints
the stupid fries are definitely something to share along with your own chicken and waffles unless your a really big eater
how cool is that they have old fashioned typewriters
dinner we had the chicken and it was to die for
if youre in this part of town i think this is probably a safe place to grab a sitdown meal thats going to be consistently good but with all the other options very near by im sure you can find restaurants with a more tailored approach to the specific dish or dishes youre after
the ham steak  eggs25 and omelette du jour17 was our entres
towards the end of our breakfast the pool was filling up
i have seen some faces change including managers and i assume that these personnel changes are the root of the problems
we are here for lunch
but all things considered its a great place to get ramen thats made fresh for a very reasonable price
it left me scratching my head wondering how a ca roll could be so good
place is cool with a different stile
this place is pretty crappy
nice selection of local craft beers
asian chicken wings  they were sticky and delish all of these dishes far exceeded my expectations
i wont be coming in much anymore
the local newspaper usually has a 2 for 1 coupon so 2 people can eat and drink for under 20
server did not even know what sushi was
i have to call out anyone who claims there is no flavour to the broth
for those pittsburghians who travel to the los angeles area let me recommend langers look it up
wed never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food
states their delivery driver went home sick
at least we didnt go through their full menu and decide on something they did not have
she even had a hard time finishing them because there were 5 very large scallops
with temps hovering around 100 degrees at 800pm the comfort of ac has its advantages
great amount and flavor was okay
our servers are so warm and inviting we linger over one more espresso one more biscotti one more chamomile infused grappa
the service is hitormiss
when it was delivered it was tasty enough
yes it is that good
some of the staff are a little quirky had a waitress that called my fianc and i by just boy and girl the whole service
i am definitely coming back like now
stopped here for lunch uptown and had a cheese and barbecue chicken pizza
i go off on the guy about what is going on and demand my order to go
the food in here are all amazing
so i ordered like their menu suggests to be clear
i got the spicy garlic broth and pork belly
buffet includes tandoori chicken and a lamb dish and they bring warm naan bread to your table
too many choicesdont know where to start
if they can address some minor issues they are fully capable of a coveted 5 star rating
we were excited they were reopening a new restaurant at this spot with a new concept
our calamari appetizer was average and it just didnt have that pipin hot freshness
good option for a burger
my hubby had the prime rib french dip sandwich simply delicious
i didnt really give our waitress a chance to greet us but i noticed that there was no silverware on the table so i inquired with a roaming chef who was very nice
i first ordered the smallman street fries
someone also mentioned top shelf as being better
we will definitely come back here again
we were told it was for two but i could have eaten this dish as an app on my own conclusion not a place to spend a dinner but there are better places out there
i had the crazy bird and my friend had the gold standard burger
so it arrived exactly as it is in the menu with none of his specifications tomato swiss and on rye
i got the regular cut fries which were only ok  nothing bad but also they didnt wow me
canes is better mainly because of their pelletshaped ice
they put man on the moon 45 years ago
the price point is also relatively high to other great taco restaurants
this excited me
dont forget to check in on foursquare to receive half off you bill food only
i was on my way home from a midday appointment and figured it would be the perfect time to finally pop into tea fusion
it takes another 5 minutes for the guy to take my order and he doesnt apologize for the wait or anything
especially considering that the price was not at all cheap i was expecting better quality
that means it frequently takes way more than a half hour to get food
bar service was very good televisions on sports you know the drill
they are too lazy too clean
the only con i have is that it took around 25 minutes to get my bowl
their grill hoods obviously dont work well since it was so smokey in the restaurant
the lady at the soup counter could clearly tell i was overwhelmed by the options and spent time talking to me about the layout and the choices
we were expecting the usual asian buffet that pittsburgh has to offer
in fact most of the people working there were amiable
i am a die hard fc fan from penrose olde yorke british style buster sea cove at st lawrence  their shoe sting fries simply annoys me to the now closed kats
we got to sit outside and got our food in under 10 minutes
while briefly waiting at the bar for a seat i ordered a cocktail that was as marvelous to watch being crafted as to taste their aladdin manhattan smoked
we didnt order a full meal here
sangria swirl  guacamole live are predictably fantastic
their serve is friendly and professional
do you have straws i asked a waiter once during breakfast
i have never had a bad experience here even on their busiest days
and surely they should know this by now
nice place to eat order the chicken tika masala and it was very good
the passion fruit is out of this world
thats why we yelp this stuff right
we were very happy with our meals that our plates were licked clean
no leftovers for him though thats for sure
awful service for large party
and in sa they dont serve alcohol which is sad because another reason i go to cf is to indulge in fine adult beverages
our extreme poutine platter was mediocre the highlight being the hamburger meat which was well seasoned but forgotten initially on our platter
sat at a table both times and service took forever
the service at this restaurant is amazing
not really sweet nor tangy but delicious nonetheless
i will need to find a new smoothie
i saw that they had it on tap and had to give it a try
inside isnt bad pretty open with perhaps a dozen flatscreens and they are lcdplasma not projection which is nice as well as six pool tables and darts
i had studied the menu ahead of time and narrowed down my selections
dessert wise there is so much i cant even list it allalthough i will say i truly enjoyed dipping my strawberries in the chocolate fountain
i was disappointed they wouldnt let me use my own teapot that i came in with but there tea was pretty decent
service was standard the place was kind of clean table smelled funky but it wasnt distracting from the food
i love this place and might have to consider moving to phoenix
from 4pm7pm they run a deal on six food options and maybe ten drink specials
and a nap afterwards
a group of us six people walked in this evening around 915 we may not have been your usual crowd crossdressers but we were dressed well and kept to ourselves
i had quinoa with korma mild and chicken
the bread was only slightly toasted and because of that there wasnt the crunch i look for when biting into a blt and instead it was mostly soft
my husband and i tried the onion strings and he had the pulled pork
that is all
you can taste the freshness of the ingredients used in the food
other yelpers said mushy and thats the way its supposed to be
solid burgers unfortunately they stopped serving their sushi because that was my favorite thing on the menu
what a great meal
every single time
we all loved that you got to customize the donuts my boyfriend doesnt eat chocolate so usually is automatically excluded from lots of options
no lie every item i asked for was gone even a smoothie
let me not mince words pho phuong is fantastic
i was on the fence about going here but decided to give it a shot which turned out well
its sweet  just average
the food lacks flavor even the rice and beans
the seabass and mushroom every time weve ordered it has been a tad salty
healthy delish breakfast
personally i dont believe anyones review when they complain about prices at a cheap sandwich shop
pot stickers were the same as any other ayce joint
the burgers looked good ive been here twice for lunch mid week and have sampled their chicken sandwiches one friend the other grilled and i was satisfied enjoyed my meals they have been good and tasty on both occasions
the vietnamese sandwich comes out on a warm crusty bun filled with a balanced combination of pork belly radishes and sauce
steak and mushrooms  on a stick was amazing moist with a drizzle of a flavorful  beef and red wine sauce
was not impressed
this place while different from my san diego joints is really good
service was fast friendly and everything was so much fun
we had seen that they had vegetarian selection and knew of a vegetarian to enjoy their meal
i can either spend money on clothes or spend money on food and i choose food every time
its so good i wont try anything else
this place is just like the cheesecake factory im sure theyre under the same ownership with a bit of a different menu
hot and sour soup tasted smoky and awful and went into the sink
service was fine though not exceptional
chickens so goood
i had the spicy tofu soup and it was pretty tasty one of the only places to actually sell kimchi pancakes so that was definitely a plus
he even have us his card for future reservations
but one of the things i love about taj palaces buffet is that they have a variety of heat levels i can step outside my comfort zone endure the burn and them cool down if i bit off more than i can chew
this place serves incredible espresso and coffee drinks
most of the time
and if i am hungry enough to finish that myself by completing the challenge i would have a 5 gift card so i can stuff my face with my burger
the deli makes great sandwiches for lunch which we ate on their porch surrounded by beautiful flower gardens
it was literally mostly all bun
my thoughts about the mgm are its simply a party paradise for young reckless alcoholic kids
great food and staff we loved it
i have not got a clue but i sat for a good hour or so and thought it was perfectly average the selection is much what i expected soup all day breakfasts paninis burgers scampi and such like
this spot has good food and seems to be pretty popular judging from the constant stream of customers coming in
every where you look you will see giadas name or her signature g everywhere on chairs plates napkins even on the pens they give you to sign your bill
stumbled upon this place late night in vegas per the cab drivers recommendations
instead of just cutting our pizza she insults us
very attentive  and the lunch sandwich specials are perfect make it a whole sandwich  and you can share and be very full
the main restaurant area is just as elegant as the bar area
both were fantastic
the hummus was cool but i tried the cookie in the car and couldnt wait to get home to finish it
breakfast line takes forever and has become overpriced
so the place rounds out to 335 stars based on the great bar and the not so amazing food
the food here is reasonably priced but it is not that good
great service and great food
i tried one and my wife the other
she told us that the kitchen staff has changed so new items on the menu
we ordered edemame ebi spicy california roll and chicken fried rice
and pretty much everything else on the menu
almost feels like a hidden scottsdale gem but every time we eat there it is busy
i took my mother and aunty here for my mothers birthday
green chili burgermy fav fast food burger joint
watch out i love sushi on eastern the same street
the sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes while their kids liked the miso soup and edamame beans which were replenished when asked
la musique est vraiment diversifie et passe de lisa leblanc  radiohead avec une fluidit surprenant et surtout la musique nest pas trop forte et tu es capable dentendre ton voisin de table parler
interior is nice very clean
the pie is so creamy and rich and the pie crust is flaky and delicious
the owner even came by our table after we had finished eating and poured us complimentary shots of his homemade limoncello
my favorite thing is the roti which is soft and buttery
pros 1 free rooms and buffet vouchers every month
the service was great as our party expanded in scope as the evening went on and the server accomdatd us with extra chairs prompt menus good suggestions and kept the food coming
what really made this night special was the amazing service
la carte est diversifie mais pas trop longue
still too heavy however
couple of vegan options on the menu too
they have these funky aromatic waters i like the happy one thats orange flavored that are only a 1  how could you say no to yummy water that will make you happy for a mere 1
kids loved the plain nan
this review is just a quickie as i did not get a real meal here
crispy but doesnt feel greasy
if you enjoy martinis then oliveortwist is a mustsee
wasnt my favourite dish might have been due to the fact i was getting full
both dishes were cooked to perfection and very flavorful
how many italian places do i pass on my way to and from la bella
they loved watching it being made from scratch using liquid nitrogen
the servers were speaking to me and my sister in chinese and it felt like beijing all over again
the meat was really good not frozen
our food took another 3040 minutes to arrive at our table
they are 3who cares you will spend that in 3 minutes in a slot machine
went here for brunch this morning sunday and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me  you claim new mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any new mexican restaurant meal
we didnt try them but the flavors sounded really good
i started out with my favorite the chicken lettuce wraps
everyone was stuffed and the food was just all around delicious
b  she demanded and i mean demanded another form of payment
so to recap tons of awesome food that is good every time
there is more on the menu but all i could try this visit
definitely going to be back soon
brios version is still better to me
the servers were attentive and did a great job with the flow of our dinner
hot and tangy in a way its hard to describe but delicious
prices are great
imagine my surprise when i heard dixieland jazz and no bossa nova
i am not discounting the effort
they are the only place ive found that actually serves quinoa
the food was great
my go to lunch and dinner spot near home
they also have vegetarian options for a lot of their food which is super considerate
just pick a drink and a food that leaps out
tender not tough and flavorful
the food is good and their outdoor patio is one of the best places to people watch
best green chimi
will definitely be coming back
they were soggy and i kinda wish i would just spent like 116th of the price eating potatoes from like kfc or something
it was a little heavy handed for me
give it a try
including the amuse buche there were 9 courses
the chicken teriyaki didnt seem like it had much flavor but they throw in a cup of some spicy cream based sauce and once you dip it in there it definitely gives it a nice tangy bite
i had the pad thai noodles with chicken no spice and i was in love
it is a bit pricey for a slice but youre on the strip so thats what can be expected
if you only come here just to experience what eating actual pita bread is like worth it
i ordered the steak and eggs hanger steak with a poached egg spinach and sauceoh man it was heavy but soo good
for my last course i enjoyed a delicious cheese plate
this time we decided to opt in for their cakes
we then had to ask our server about the prix fixe and only then did he get us the menu that states what is part of it
i dont recall what was in it other than a 5th of some sort of alcohol
another thing is that they have a separate menu for the drivethru so they do give you options
the crow bar i think
i actually really liked this place surprisingly enough
the food was left unfinished and now we are going to eat street tacos
they were assembling our trays and asked if it was correct which seemed so but we were being rushed
chatted with owner who is really friendly so important for good service
die terrasse liegt leider direkt an der haupstrasse
sigh i wonder how they fared after the whole cambie street expansion to the airport sigh my dinner companion has been here before so i let him choose the plates
the problem we had was with the service
it may be the only reason id come back
maybe because it was the end of the night but he was just dropping off random desserts at our table
i dont even think half the shops are connected to a water line or have a sink
butter was bland and tasted like a mix between whipped and margarinei had to season with salt and pepper
i refrained from trying any though since i was with someone who doesnt drink
the staff is very friendly and helpful
i am still working off my splurge here from the other weekend
chocolate chip seemed too safe so i went with the corn cookie
once i got my entree it was neither hot nor spicy
the manager ask me if it the first time in  explained the items on the menu
service wasnt horrible but you had to ask for things instead of them offering
it is around fifty something per person for lunch
as i finished my last few bites we were greeted by nancy she just wanted to check in regarding our meal and the service
i will never return here and need to tell everyone i know to do the same
the food was good
while we were sitting there 2 other tables were seated and they left before ordering
forgot to mention shrimp rolls were delicious
the sauce and cheese were runofthemill largechain quality
this place is well located and well maintained
best bagels in vegas
i did not need a knife as everything was easily pulled from the bones
we started with the seared fois gras
some customers were invited to dance not i unfortunately but then again i might have done something unconventional
they even handled a more detailed special order super  every time weve gotten it
1st time to nicks based off of yelp comments and was not disappointed
great broth fast fast service and restaurant is clean
atmosphre und einrichtung sind fr mich zeitlos
pizza is oknothing special
i came in for dinner since a friend of mine highly recomends this place
i ordered a medium size and it was 8 before taxes
dessert we ordered the blueberry pie which we though would be quickwrongtook nearly 20 minutes to get when they said 5 minutes
the decor was interesting
after my delicious first wrap i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef
they open at 5pm and are closed sundays
1st visittwo hours before closing and they were out of 80 of the items on the menu
this has become a favorite of ours and is added to our list of go to places when in the area
it also gives me quite an amusement to see the other chinese restaurant carting their dim sum around
finally after three visits over the past couple of yearsthe verdict is in
we love athens
we hate high end restaurants that are right on casino floors and you hear the riff raff
my mum was with us too  she couldnt keep standing there much longer
for those of you in the northwest valley the owner said hes getting ready to open up a new location in the arrowhead mall part of town
the food the service and the ambiance of this place blew me away
spinach gorgonzola bacon red onion spicy pecans oranges strawberries and red grapes with balsamic vinaigrette  their bread is almost a little too crusty for me but its still good
they are a bit on the salty side though
i thought maybe just maybe today i would try something new like a wrap but nope i failed
maybe they were short staffed but not my problem
the hostess was very unorganized and several tables were open and when asked about them the hostess had no idea they were open
built in the early 90s to be the premier namesake of the mgm corporation the hotel originally had a classic hollywood theme
wow this place is pack the line are out the door but dont discourage wait it is so worth it the best tacos is this side of town im from oc i heard about this place through a friend im so happy i came the alpastor is so good with slice of pineapple
2 plating of corned beef hash
the mix of cold and hot items balances each other out and satisfy mind body and soul
but the chicken taco and shredded pork taco was atrocious
ive always been a big fan of papa murphys and this is a great location
i think downtown tempe lacks a great food selection
ive never left a restaurant feeling happier about the meal and the owner
and ladies they have purse hooks under the bar
my favorites are the avocado egg rolls and calamari
once you try the food there it will keep you coming back for more and moreoh by the way while you there make sure you also stop at the store as well and pick up some delicious and unique items that you wont find in your local grocery store
happy hour here with friends is a bunch of fun regardless of whether you want to drink or not
and of course the salad bar is great too
the brioche tasted like it was doused with bacon another bread toasted tasted like it was dipped in rosemary the last one the hardest one of them all had a taste of fennel seeds
ive been here too many times to count
when someone finally came by to pick up the bill i explained this
my eggs were anything but over easy
over all an amazing experience this place is awesome
the service and ambiance are very lacking
the lamb was extremely tender and the cheese in the paneer tikka massala was really dense which i liked
the bill his strip my filet1 glass of wine and 1diet coke was right at 100
thats more i like it
i like my everything bagel with the nova cream cheese
heres some of what we sampled chicken soup  yummy flavours and perfect for a cold evening
the salsa isnt too spicy and i like how the chips arent too salty
the grass jelly for dessert was definitely the best part of the whole meal
as i said the pizza was actually really good
trendy vegan place in downtown lv
either way i enjoyed it
pro tip the got food line is a separate line and if you order anything hot lets say 5 to 10 worth you can get those guys to get your samosas for you
which means they dont water down their smoothies
server wasnt the friendliest but was efficient and did things without being asked re  offered a refill of bread refilled water brought bill as soon as asked
for me personally the one thing i would not get again was the pork belly on grits
the little broth that it had was very flavorful and rich
i stopped and said were not leaving
diversity is welcome here
the dining room has comfortable seating and plenty of light from the large windows
everyone comes out from the managers office
just as good as people say it is
located in a quaint older building in the arts district downtown
great sandwiches for a great price
service attentive starting with glen the bartender
it took a while for us to snag down a waiteri had to wave to them three times before they saw us
nice change around here
both were a disappointment and neither dish was finished
one of the more creative places in montreal
the jalapeo cheese and chorizo combination topped with a perfectly cooked over easy egg was too much to pass up
my boyfriend and i came here to celebrate out anniversary a few month back
i dont know what the deal is with these older reviews but my husband and i are new to the area and trying out all the restaurants in the area
thinking back til this day i continue to firmly believe that someone out there decided to gather all the ridiculously good looking guys and gals in vegas and proceeded to place them all at encore
would not recommend
this is located at the desoto central market along with a number of other restaurants
their burgers are a great size so you dont need to worry about leaving hungry
as for dinner if you want meat go for the byblos mix grill it gives you a little of everything which i like as for my vegetarian friends try the vegetarian combo its wonderfulnow for lunch the byblos greek burger is great
ive been a server myself and i would have never done that
i even added pepperoni because im a meatatarian haha
to add insult to massive injury his response to my credit card was and i quote dont you have cash
saw our waiter again for our bill
vide le midi en milieu de semaine 11h service rapide
i was at maxs last weekend
on top of the great food the service was even better
it w as super busy though so i guess i am not the only one who likes chiken
dont forget to check out the killer salsa bar with everything necessary to kick things up a notch
this restaurant has been on my list for the longest time
the beans were good but a little too seasoned for me
and we could still see the server prepping the food without gloves
it gets busy sometimes but they have a big patio if you dont mind enjoying the weather outside
we arrived and were quickly seated we ordered the guacamole as an appetizer which we all enjoyed
overall a great burger with a not so great experience
dirty inside the window sills had food in them and the floors under the tables by the windows were dirty
service at this location is friendly and it is easy to get a reservation through opentablecom
the pancakes were delicious and i loved the syrup
we ordered 1 hookah which came with a free refill hummus chicken satay and 2 well drinks and 1 tea pot
the eggs are cooked and after that their throw the rest of the ingredients inside and slice of plain american cheese inside which was barely melted
when we finally ordered it took a while for the food to come out but when it came out it was hot fresh hot out of the oven  stove
the food was pretty good with huge portions
the heirloom tomatoes were fantastic but maybe a bit offputting at first due to their green color
the flavors were stellar and everything was cooked well
we wont go back
our favorite is the gouda brizza breakfast pizza  smoked gouda bacon hollandaise sauce and scrambled eggs
they have a smoothie special that changes frequently but the tropical smoothies and the pink panther are the best
the service is always great with friendly servers
i ended up getting a bone in ribeye and it was 910
when then weather was cold their warm lentil soup was also a great treat
lots of neat lamps casting warmer than usual light wood ceilings wood furniture all with a modern vibe and a utilitarian cement floor
i didnt expect to like this place i would definitely try it again
it was too hot for tea so i did not use the water dispenser
staff are friendly and they have great costumer  service
instead of ground beef it was made with a slightly spicy sausage that had been broken up perfectly no chunks or tough pieces
it was also a slight when who we assume was the manager circulated to various tables but for some reason never really spoke to us except when she plopped down some bread sticks in an empty water glass bread sticks in a french restaurant
at first i wasnt sure why the tacos were 245 but once i saw how big they were i can say  the price is well justifiedlike justin timberlake
i havent been writing reviews lately but i felt inclined the write this one
dont come here at all
pho was a bit on the pricier side for what it was
we watched multiple tables around us turn over
bar area and floors were so sticky
all in all youve been warned dont come here
the home fries however looked like something that came out of a bag and just got heated up in the oven
first of all the parking is completely inadequate for the amount of tables they have here
like a more fun alternative to panera
one of the owners came by and asked if wed like to try the sesame ball which has red bean inside
its bad enough that this business charges for ice water now 40 cent overcharge for an incorrect item
fries were accidentally replaced with tater tots and the food wasnt very good even for a sonic
i use to love to get the pork ramen with the extra types of pork the pork belly was my favorite and they have now gotten rid of that and the chicken karage
she handed me a tiny cup of slawlike in a tarter sauce cup and said thats it
we ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer which was the only positive experience dinning at this restaurant
everything was top notch
i had a grilled chicken sandwich
i was in town for business and we ended up at house of leng for lunch on our final day
overali i believe there are other italian restaurants on the west side of las vegas that offer better value
the restaurants is forcing people to order more than they need which is totally unacceptable
we got them with both the onionsbacon and the sour cream
this location is nice food are in large portions and is pretty decent
just solid nonchain food style barbecue that satisfies
if you want to hear your companions sit outside
it remains an excellent choice for steak in vegas but wheres the japanese beef
what can i say
and the food is pretty decent
it two pancakes merged together and then finished in the oven
1218 for 2 tacos
they all have super crispy crust with clean layers that havent been soaked by the custard
the restaurant has a classy vibe to it
i was worried about the special beef lanzhou noodles lacking in flavour based on the colour of the broth however it ended up being packed with flavour
but the service was 5star and on an occasion such as this it really made the afternoon less stressful and as pleasant as possible
well its not the grilled chicken was cold and while there was a lot of it looked like shredded chicken thats prob not so fresh if you catch my drift
the happy menu is really amazing served at the bar or at the outdoor areas only including a 10 lobster and seared tuna flatbread that will knock your socks off
the food was good but luke warm of 4 breakfasts 3 were not very warm
when i turned to my friend to say something the waitress already came back with miso soups and our drinks
they were quite small and dry in my opinion
the meats were good
i had the cubano sandwich with fresh cut fries and it was really good but the fries were slightly underdone
theres generally a wait in the evenings but its absolutely worth it
i love to order the chicken quesadilla and the steak burrito which are equally as delicious as they are authentic
their lees coffee is a favorite
man kann fr 45euro mittag essen
the food was very savorful and authentic
miscellaneous the restaurants dcor is to some extent outdated but their restroom is clean and there is plenty of parking
not a big fan of the slaw so i usually take some of it off the sandwich
other than great company the food is also pretty good
we opted to wait for 10 minutes while we shared the croissant and sipped coffee
it was all succulent as fk
cool spot but thought the menu was lacking
which is fine but may be an issue for some people though unfortunately his lack of notetaking proved to be a problem
catch this late night burger truck
buffetsayce places are really not my style i never feel like i eat my moneys worth
cet emplacement se remplit vite et  17h30 on a t chanceux de prendre lune des dernires tables disponibles
i was a little skeptical but it was excellent
atmosphere  4 out of 5  the lounge looks awesome with comfy seats for small groups
my boyfriend and i walked all the way from the strip just to eat here and it was well worth it
i was definitely full after lunch we ate at the healthy place
beware dishonest business practices
i was a little cautious because of its location and the way it looked outside but i am glad i tried it out
the naan was like the size of my face
all 3 of the sauces that come on the caprese were on the side in little containers  they even sent some bread and delicious roasted garlicky buttery hummus with the order as well
i work in the area when i returned and told them about the service the said oh yeah they are known for poor service we never go there
this place is definitely for the open minded and willing to try new things
this was my first trip to arizona in 4 years and i made a point to bookmark some bakeries
my husband had veal marsala that wasnt on the menu but they were very accomodating when he asked if they could make it
the hot dog was good
came here with my family while visiting madison and boy was it delicious
our service was horrible
well they were better then mom ever made and moms a great cook
the soup was creamy without being over milky  the mushroom flavor was apparent throughout the entire soup
tell me how many other places would do that for you
i know three stars doesnt sound so great but i really have no complaints about americas taco shop
get the chicken souvlaki
i also love the fact they have weird but cool japanese drinks like fizzy yogurt and some sort of japanese vanilla sprite that comes in a cool bottle   the staff are very nice and friendly they even gave me samples of these drinks after i pulled a confused face
the austins potatoes were supposed to be topped with carmelized onions
and reasonably priced
prehaps my friend and i visted them on an off night
what can i say about a fluffy soft steamed bun overflowing with pork belly except for yum yum in my tum tum
the holiday price for this past mdw was 27 for their dinner buffet this is a relatively moderate price compared to other hotel buffets on the strip they had a large variety of food at this buffet but the quality was a little lack luster since i had been drinking all day i wasnt able to handle much food so i only ate their fries and a few pieces of california roll my friends tried a little bit of everything and thought that it was good for a buffet but not the best from my own experience the fries were terrible and so dry they might as well have been stale but the california roll was amazing
the platter should have been bigger
i love this and cant wait to return to try more dishes
a fusion of japanese and italian  and then some in a very quaint locale
this place is becoming a goto for lunch whenever im in north york
they must have had a different juan cooking in the back
i had the paneer jalfrezi  a dish with which i was previously unfamiliar
not sure about their lunch or happy hour but really love the layout of this place
i dont blame on it on the place but i just have to say i didnt feel like that until after the food
i just with they would update their decor a bit as some of the carpet and stuff is starting to look worn
naan tandoori chicken pallak paneer chicken tikka masala rice pudding etc
thank goodness for tofu
the chicken adobo was 75 bone hardly any meat in there which was disappointing
i had the paitan broth with roasted pork pork belly crackling hard boiled egg and kimchi
luckily for me tacos tequila whiskey was delicious and can now be a part of my weekly taco rotation
on vacation with my wife in september 2012 we went to jaleo and had our minds blown
wed already had dinner so we checked out a few wine bars in the hudson area
we both liked it and they brought it to us on two separate plates cut perfectly in half with separate fries
my family and i have been coming to casa manila for years now
not sure but i have thought that the last 3 visits
the soup was quite wonderful
the service in the restaurant is really show a function of the fact they under consistently understaff
i think the lattes are tasty and beautiful especially the vanilla bean with almond milk
i asked them not to put the sauce on the burger and to put it in the side and they did
cauliflower was pretty good but slightly under seasoned the salads were overpriced for basic ingredients the french fries were horrible dont really understand how you can screw french fries up the steakmeh the best thing we had was the lobster with truffle sauce and butter
cadillac fajitas were perfect as was the chile con queso
the menu here is hugeee packed with an array of fresh made ice creams crepes waffles cakes shakes and coffee drinks
we then got the beef tartare starter
if theres an option of none star i would be happier
12 star because theres no precarnage buffet but maybe thats part of the rodizio experience
best by february 10th
i will say that the managements recommendation that we eat family style was the right call
we ended up with a glass of wine each and he had the salisbury steak and i had the prime rib
service is excellent and the spaciousness and high ceilings of the restaurant made the experience enjoyable
went to the zoo and dillons for the very first time on 1315
my second order today was a hot roast beef sandwich with bbq sauce and potato salad
we have egg and milk allergies but we are not going to have an epi pen saga if a tiny bit slips into our cooked foods
in fact i think wild wing sucks
the chicken was maaaad salty
ive been three times
and the place was spotless
it wasnt busy at all and the pastry case was full
unique flavorful and delicious
and i just want to say that the servers here are all so awesome
we will have to go to the joey at yorkdale because both makrham and don mills have disappointed us
they had warming trays out with ham bacon and potatoes
dont come here looking for the positive attitude of yogi bear
unless you want to get taken for a fool
i think they know that being in the middle of 3 golf retirement communities means better than average service is expected and better than average freshness of the food is required
our second visit and this time we brought friends
so i couldnt tell if it was mexicanized traditional or if it was just plain bland
the specialty margaritas are wonderful the antojitos sabrosos and the main courses leave you stuffed wishing you could consume more
3 dip rice wrappers in hot water to reconstitute them then lay on your plate
their macarons are not the prettiest but after you have one you wont care how they look when posted to social media because theyre delicious
as far as appetizers go we get the potato skinsfries with the salmon
you can thank me later
quelle dcouverte
thanks to living social for this find
