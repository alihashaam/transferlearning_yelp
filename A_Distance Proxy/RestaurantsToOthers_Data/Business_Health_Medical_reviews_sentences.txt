im so happy i met her and decided to do this program
no one called me to confirm my appointment either  after receiving a facial and a massage i was then told by the same manager that had cleared my appointment the night before that she needed to obtain the gift card from me that i had explained i did not have
a doctor who cares
now i have to go to metro and file a police report for all this crap
i searched yelp and found dr bybee
vanessa the medical assistant was awesome and very helpful as well
this is truly unacceptable
this establishment obtained my debt card information from a pervious visit without my permission and set up their own an auto pay and amount
i was told to arrive 15 minutes early which i did
i got some flowers lemon draiz and 2 prerolls c4 really wicked   cookietangi cant wait
and pointed at a sign w suggested tips rates
the results were great
thats a nice 35 increase in revenue per patient for the office visit
a special thank you to kaija christine sarah carrie and drs
i called his office and his staff stated that he primarily treats women and couples never just seeing men
i have a life again
try her out
for now dr craddock was very caring listened to me
do not use this place
that was when he began yelling
i am very pleased with the skills of my injector but you loose 2 stars because of the snooty reception
hes extremely down to earth friendly and knows whats hes doing with his 20 years of experience
had a tooth blow up on me about 2 months ago
i thought it was a mistake and felt he would easily fix itwrong
we brought her in for rehab and she was progressing really well
everyone at this place does a fantastic job and even though i only get to see them once every summer i thoroughly enjoy my time there
came in at 830 on a monday morning and had my exam test run and prescription in hand by 900 so much faster than other walk ins ive been too and the staff were very friendly
i was in town on business and had a serious injury to my eyes
i thought oh well i prefer glasses so made a new appt for this year then the day of my appt
i just got back from one of the best dental experiences
i did speak to the office manager who was patronizing and not helpfuli am also attempting to work with the better business bureau
i was there last week and my appointment was for a cleaning a filling and to get one of my teeth ready for a crown
dont go here
the whole procedure only took about an hour in total and i felt nothing
i came to him some 10 years ago after a phoenix eye doctor did too many rk surgeries on my eyes
to the office managers credit she did refund my entire purchase without any fuss whatsoever and was nice about doing so
staff is friendly and helpful
the office is openly spacious clean the front office staff greeted me with a smile and the ma was very kind
super sad that this clinic wont be around anymore ive only been going for less than two weeks but dr hedrington has been beyond amazing making sure i can get what i need done before the clinic closes so she can guide me in the right direction when it does
dr eric is wonderful
i called before hand to get a breakdown of the fees so i could budget accordingly and to schedule my appointment
i kick myself now for not leaving then
my children always receive high level compassionate care
bread is truly my kryptonite but i feel more confident that i know what my body can and cannot handle based on my experience with trimbody md
unfortunately i have had quite a few sports related injuries over the years that required surgery and physical therapy to fully recover
not only did they fix it while i waited they did it for free
so far so good
i was surprised to see a top ten listing for do
making life hard for sick people
she can mix up personalized products just for you
i was extremely disappointed
i am glad i was able to find a dr i was comfortable with the first go around and i will be sticking with her while i live in charlotte
it would greatly behoove dr colin to learn an iota of compassion and understanding
she is smart and professional and wonderful about answering all of my questions and i knew very little so she was a total dream
very disappointed in my 10 minute discussion with dr kaiser md he was not interested in the fact that i have multiple drug drug interactions with antibiotics and he prescribed me a medication that i was allergic to very disappointed in his lack of patient patient interaction
she is an excellent dentist
ive been going to venus foot spa for a few months now and i received 5 star experience every time the place is very clean and they have the asian style dividera lot more private than one of those short cheap curtains that many places around here have
super nice and even charged my phone
after spending 100 a treatment at a traditional chinese acupuncture center and knowing i could not sustain that fee weekly for months  i came to community acupuncture
so i made an appointment here and they meet my expectation and beyond
i also wont lie and say that another part of me always looking forward to going is because there is a really cute dental assistant there that ive been eyeing for a while   honestly love it here
i had a appointment and waited a month for the results
love this location
if you go to this office dont ever go to dr pereztselikis
no pain  not even the novocaine shots
so i decided to go on saturday because i felt like i had a bad uti
i have not seen her there before
thanks so much lanas
such an incredible company
dr smith is wonderful and thorough
my son was failing math and barely passing his other classes
i am very grateful for this experience and the prompt service
but lets face it the office itself is just really cool with a view of downtown from your chair and rooms that look like theyre fresh out of an ikea catalog
urgent care extra your front counter employees leave allot to be desired at this location
perhaps it is simply the doctor we dealt with who made our experience memorably awful
saw the doctor and he was very supportive and comforting
i wouldnt go anywhere else in vegashenderson and wish that he was local to me
beware unprofessional and in it for the money
i love dr chen
the staff is friendly dr heffelfinger is very thorough and i completely trust my eyes to her
even though i trusted him too many people were sorry back in 2014 for having the procedure done
i highly recommend him
we take value cab back and ask for ride to airport he offers a wake up call and is so kind
so i approached heather with the intention of releasing my emotional pain
so i started researching nutritionists in the scottsdale area
dr jarman did more for me in one visit than my previous podiatrist did in years of seeing him
all teeth are charted and mapped outshe records everything and she watches for receding gums and will take steps to correct whatever she can with her services
if this rating were based on my experiences with only him there would be negative stars if possible
she didnt ask what kind of pressure i liked
her service is simple and you are in and out within an hour
youve been coughing up lungs all night long for about 6 days now
the workouts with mike are never the same no workout splits and he customizes my workouts to satisfy my exercise add while increasing my strength agility flexibility and balance
i went to jesse after reading all the amazing reviews and they are all 100 true
i went there for the first time the other night  and i was pleasantly suprised  best massage i have had yet  i will be back
and i think that is enough
i continue to go there even after moving out of the area and even when another rmt was across the street from my home
what about the connection between the doctor and the patient that is the foundation for accuracy in diagnosis
at one of the visits my daughter had a very itchy unusual rash on the bottom of both her feet
i got in really quick but the staff on the back including an older gentlemen with glasses were just not nice people
i moved to the providence area and found this one close to my house
after the first treatment no hair grew back until 23 weeks after and it came back in patches and much finer
i ended up having to waitand wait while he searched continuously telling me that he couldnt find me
our wait was between one hour and 90 mins to see a doctor which is better than wait times at an emergency room
just wish they were open sundays
today i called the office because i thought i might have injured my eye and i didnt know what to do
very odd as there are always at least 2 or 3 staff at the reception desk idling
smirked the entire time and looked like she was about to laugh any minute
the office is very professional and accommodating
their customer service sets the bar very very high
my thought process is this if charles can help me and my skin not look so fatigued  im a fan
this was my second visit for routine labs
we have been going here since my girls are babies and my oldest is 5 now
we drove further for this er but would gladly do it again
i have suffered from migraines and severe headaches for over 10 years
great service helpful accommodating staff
she would not look at it but said i could fill out the info
dont rely on them either for test results or referrals eitheryoure gonna have to call to make sure things get done
this is a nightmare
thanks you too the staff for making my first experience a very pleasurable one
thanks for turning this around on me and blaming me for you having to cancel my appointment and now being out 100
i have an impeccable financial record and to be talked to both without honoring the promise and in addition the threat is a totally unacceptable practice
unfortunately in todays world good customer service is hard to find
this is the fast alternative
they have the nicest staff the cleanest facility and they really make you feel comfortable
i recommend her highly
dr nick warner always does a great job
dr rayls is one of my all time favorite surgeons
his studio is conveniently located in henderson next to the galleria mall and sunset station area so youll be able to get to him within 2030 mins from anywhere in las vegas
we havent had any problems with him or his staff
she asked all of four questions and was way too busy
all i can say is dont deal with kayla
i would recommend this vision center to anyone who needs an eye exam or needs contact lenses or glasses
definitely an oasis in this dessert
the procedure was quick painless and the downtime and recovery were an absolute breeze
they should do themselves a favor a get rid of melissa as the face of the company and the person answering the phone and handling customer issues she is rude and unprofessional
i usually get swedish or deep tissue
my husband and i highly recommend springfield pediatrics
she bitched that the door was open and there were no security guards
yesterday and was treated like complete trash
had an appointment at 330 showed up at 330 my first time apparently it was critical to show up 15 minutes early
my family and i went here to try and find something comparable to shakeology for my boys
the reflexology part of the event was weak
also very frustrating
it took a little longer than expected but its literally the only urgent care open that late and it was a busy night
everyone is friendly and very good at what they do
he pretty much had a super long heart attack and no one cared or listened
wendy listens cares and sees you as a whole person
even though the staff took time to make conversation with me i was inandout within 35 minutes
this is not your ordinary wanttobe ramen places owned by nonjapanese
maybe spent five minutes total
at the recommendation of a friend we decided to try the gibbons and were very glad we did
he trained me properly in and 3 months i started seeing obvious changes to my body that he helped coach me to
had a great experience
affordable great service
i went out to tell the nurse and she said no one had told her about the pain med
she was in and out of the office within 25 hours max
i really cant say enough how much i appreciate every one at this imaging location
howeverthey have called my house every single month for months on end asking for blood
but by far the most annoying thing was the salesperson pushing these unknown brands
he made my daughter feel relaxed and explained to me what was going to be done
when i call them jim  the guy who makes the reservations  makes stuttering noises mutters something about how he has been on vacation seriously every time then tells me he is on the line with another bride  has to call me back
people that got there 34 hours after us were leaving before us
havent had a billing problem
the office is beautiful and very clean
he did not push for surgery but explained it as a possibility when i asked
dr palacios is definitely a top doc in the nation
nice shower facility to clean up afterwards as well
then the doctor have me a lecture about not writing down my past surgical history
the doctor listened to my concerns
a word of wisdom if u had issues with ur previous session like u were really sore afterwards or you did not like your therapist change things around
best laser place ive ever been to
his office is a little hard to find but it is definitely a treasure hunt worth embarking on
great customer service from terrific people
i was just in for my second six month cleaning and appreciated the good work and fun they have in the office
i presume she did this after she saw my 1star yelp review
she never touched the underside of my teeth
dr levin and the entire staff are wonderful
this is a place i would recommended to anyone
i was hooked on opt
we receive great care at garner
what a scam do not purchase from this place
went after 8am to get my nv food handlers card
it opens until 10pm weekdays
normally i dont like to leave negative reviews
i had a great experience
very satisfied with this experience
what a wonderful place
ive been taking my son here for 7 yrssince he was borni had my 2nd son and took him there tooalways had pleasant visits
absolutely horrible experience ever with a dr asked personal questions that had nothing to do with my symptoms
the area is clean and well decorated
its a real shame too because i originally found them on angies list and now i found out dr allen will only be seeing cash payments at another facility
appointment was for 12pm i arrived at 1155am didnt get called back until 1225pm then waited in room until 1255pm for doctor to come in not to know wtf to do
im dont always make the best life decisions but im not so stupid as to type in my companys corporate card number for a snakeoil nutritional supplement and have it delivered to my office
theres so many bad reviews on here for them that should be enough of a warning
the only reason im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait time
i was there for his professional opinion and i got it
i told him id be happy to wait all day because if i didnt speak with gail on this call my next call would be to the nevada optometry board
she eventually die during the time i was there
we had to wait for approval for the replacements
i just called again trying to make an appointment she asked if i had seen dr lucas before and i said yes at her prior practice i got a condescending laugh and a response of well youd be a new patient then our system is down so you can call tomorrow
guess that was forgotten too
in my opinion the staff should be coached and trained on how to handle nervous children or even calm down someone who is upset
thats 15 a page in which she was single copying every page so she can charge every page i then called the nevada dental examiner board and told them what karen was charging me and they said she can only charge me up to 60 per page not 15
i couldnt be more pleased with his professionalism he has all the traits you look for in a physician
get over yourself you are not that important to vegas residents
i know i wanted it locked
couldnt ask for more
easy to get an appointment
he seems to genuinely be concerned about whats causing a persons illness
i did not like either one  they pretend to be the premier place to go but truthfully they are subpar   i viewed them as used car salesmen
the staff was friendly and the dentist was great
not a typical midwife experience like i had with my last one in another city
longer story of how horrible health plan of nevada is my pregnant wife and i signed up and paid for their 800month hmo plan during the open enrollment period at the end of 2014 right off the bat they enrolled us in the wrong plan
dr dlugas is fantastic
i called the customer service number on the bottom of my confirmation email and i was told that was not a location and i told the man on the phone that i was outside the door that said lab corp and had the hours for saturday 7 am12 pm and several other people were also waiting in the hall
the front desk receptionist was not as friendly as i would have expected but she was not rude either
i was assured up and down that desert west was in fact a provider for my new insurance
that is a little ridiculous
more than ones they ran over one hour behind
but if you dont see something you like they are also willing to order it
fortunately the eye glass store appears to be mostly independent and theres no pressure whatsoever to buy from them
i went to this spa to get a full set
although i felt fine after my donation was complete a couple of hours later i felt weak and had no energy to do anything
i trust her dental advice and will definitely be back for a cleaning
super gentle super sweet
imagine if i showed up an hour late for my appointment
jai pu regarder le menu
couldnt have asked for better service
doctors and chiropractors are all closed so we couldnt get in till monday
i was very lucky to have meet drrichard
dr williamson was referred to me by emergency chiropractic they only deal in accident related injuries
ok so maybe i didnt forget as much as i enjoyed it just as much
another staff came in to see how i was doing and said that the dental hygenist was just going to jump back and forth between myself and the other patient since she had two patients scheduled around the same time
so i recommend you to stay away
my girlfriend new just who to try first and she was right
you are then given an automated offer where youll be cancelled but must pay for the product received at the full 30day supply price i thought it was a trial
i was in and out of there in 30 minutes and it was the least painful mammogram i have ever  had in all of my 65 years
there are plenty of other chinese doctors in vegas my family have seen a few before we found dr guo but none of them can compare
no return call
i highly recommend this office for your dental needs
so glad turntable health opened
very nice med spa with a knowledgeable staff  inexpensive
i look and feel like a million dollars
if you make an appointment you need to double check because they do not always call to remind you
as a personal recommendation from my own experience go elsewhere anywhere is better than this sewage pit
the wait time was speedy and everyone who assisted me was friendly including the rn
highly recommend the cool sculpting
a discount shouldnt even be a word used in an instance such as this
dr laris bedside manner is second to none
the staff however is abysmal
why ask the day if your going to try and schedule me a completely different day
wifi phone chargers super clean
when the owner louis was talking to the class he would only field answers that had to do with quantawe asked about a different laser and he quickly shot the question down and changed subjectsmy first red flag with nli the classes are easytoo easy
dr jacobsen has been taking care of my entire family for 5 years now and every time we go its like going to see an old friend and getting your teeth cleaned at the same time
if that the case its not fair to blame that on dr hangalays office
only downside was the booking of my appt which was about 6 weeks out
i am so happy i found this place
i was never told what bhrt was what pellets were and pricing
not one person in 5 hours smiled at me said they were sorry i wasnt feeling well or attempted in any way to make me feel comfortable
i hope it works
i would definitely recommend skyview to anyone looking for a premium dentistry experience in charlotte
he is the best never leaving me sore or bruised
will definitely go back if we ever need to
i have gone here over the years since moving locations and seeing dr sun jones i will be finding a new place to go dr jones is useless
she does a great job and i am a repeat customer
dr nagy is amazing
as for the therapists and actual massages its hit or miss
this happened once before when dr webb had an emergency with a patient at a hospital so he was not there when i arrived for my appointment
quit the critiquing and do your job
today is my 1st visit in the new office
it felt so good not the process knowing that i had done everything that i could do to rid myself of any toxicity in my colon
i will never get a facial anywhere else
i would be lying if i said i felt nothing
if you are in need of an emergency roomtry presby in matthews wait times were half and the folks we met at the pharmacy had a much better outcome than us
he is compassionate and will do just what is needed at the time with suggesting what to do next if more work is needed
i found the dr  very knowledgeable and thorough
i had to go back four times
kimberly the manager was extremely careless of my medical condition that i need my medication for and denied my request to simply switch it out for the correct medication
why take the job if you dont want to work with people patients but seems to be across the medical industry of people working for drs who dont like people
k2 and chad are awesome and the whole staff is friendly and professional
i decided to stop in yesterday to get a quote on my tattoo and andy was there to answer my questions
i went out to assess the situation and learned that the customer had purchased numerous services by phone transaction documented on credit card statement and had received 20 units of botox out of 80 and 1 endimed in may including 1 microdermabrasion on oct 22 and denied the remainder of services bought microdermabrasions peels botox endimed and bellas worth 5000
dr mcgee took the time to make sure i understood the whole process his assistant angel is very sweet and made sure i had everything ready for surgery
die bezahlung dafr
he has incredible bedside manor takes extra time with you to calm your nerves and give you individualized care
he hates it when his foot soak is 20 minutes of the massage
she listened and helped me with my back problem
he seemed sleazy rushed the consultation pushed his own opinion of what he thought that i needed versus listening to what i wanted as well
his selection is great
im pretty sure them being all in my billing account at my previous dentist violates hipaa
i never usually make yelp reviews but this was extreme enough that i felt the need to warn others who dont want to wait two hours to be helped
yeah i wont be back
im used to the fast fast in and out mens haircut but here they take the time to make it perfect
theyre lucky her parents werent with her
i had my galbladder removed 2 days ago by dr petersen
i am free of methadone now and learning a whole new way to be
he even took the time to thoroughly explain everything that he was going to do and why
i dont really mind the switch but i wasnt informed of the first switch until i called to confirm my appointment
they also provide other services for instance going to doctors appointments and notary public
some are completely rude and out of order
i would echo athan
dr yesnick was totally professional during my visit with him
i had a deep tissue massage 90mins and upon completion i felt like a new being
i highly recommend them
little did i know it was just a ploy to make money off of their patients
i have visual voicemail going back to september no message from this office
the staff is very professional friendly and helpful
he said nothing
work at that
once i got to the room they had to draw my blood i ended up with a huge bruise because i couldnt lay still when she was trying to stick the needle in give me an iv and wait for results before i got my epidural
i showed lacey a picture of what i wanted my hair to look like and she made it happen
i would caution anyone who is interested in signing up for a me membership to read the fine print and dont do it
he then went on to say there was 50something ppl ahead of me and that it cannot be done sooner
my only complaint is that they really push the products
i had no  choice and had to go here based on my previous experience
the place is clean
my husband and i have been patients of dr tricia white for years
my biggest mistake was taking my mum here
dr gates and staff are so  friendly and go over everything with you
very clean comfortable and peaceful office and ive never been left waiting in the waiting room or for treatment
i still havent been waited on and its been at least 20 or so minutes
yes it was a lot but i was curios to see the difference and wanted to look my best at my sisters wedding
they actually told me that the wait was 45 hours because they only had one provider there
i sit there and think did i pass it
i was under the care of allison the fnp however she recently left without any notice as its common place i suppose and just prior to this summer in may i met the new pa megan yanno but after calling for a prescription she wrote i was just told she was no longer with them
i had to see dr gibson one week and she was phenomenal as well
had i been told that is the current practice for drop ins up front i would never have signed in
got to enjoy both of the instructors in a combo class
i have been going to them once a year for a few years now and each session reveals something different
if i can find someone better i may not be coming back to this clinic
you walk into the same waiting room that you sit in to see the doctors  but you dont interact with the attendants at the window
the machine they use for treatments blows cold air onto your skin where the laser is treating which makes it virtually pain free
i spent a majority of my time with carrie and dr beth
great stuff urgent care extra
they even offer tea that you can enjoy for free before class and free hair ties in case us ladies forget to bring ours
she always takes care of me and any doctor ive visited here takes their time and doesnt rush you out of the office
however thomas et all here at eyeglass world were amazing and worked with my doctor at home to set me up
ive suffered with back pain for years
there was a woman in the triage puking her guys out crying she too hadnt seen a doctor the attending whoever they are ignored her and lied to her that a doctor was coming soon and it never showed
they then refused to even do his cleaning until he scheduled for a deep cleaning which was going to cost us about 200
he is an extraordinary dentist who has fixed numerous cavities in both of my sons teeth effortlessly without the use of any medication
lethargic is when a kid will just lay there and let me stick needles in their arms
he does quality prep work which is what makes all the difference when you want a perfect end result
the staff is great right from the getgo
every single time you go in their office you wait for 2 hours
even the receptionist that took the call acted put off that i had an opinion about my choices with my body
these people do not study anatomy
i lost the drive to do the diet and walked away when i reached a 70 lb loss
they told me it was bad for my kidneys but didnt offer to give me a prescription to help with the pain
stephanie the receptionistoffice manager rocks
now everyone fills out a form and lists health history medications allergies etc right
he thoroughly explained a treatment for me with ice and heat stretches light exercises and walks along with my meds which the doctor at umc never did
after 1 week my pain is gone and i feel great
the staff is friendly
i have referred quite a few people over the years and everyone has been very happy with dr reuss and his office staff
her office didnt look like a dental office i felt i was at the seven star hotel with luxury spa with special  treatments
looking at possible biopsy and other concerns are a serious and sensitive issue for any woman
i would recommend this clinic to everyone
the office is easy on the eyes and makes you feel so comfortable coming in
here is easy
the dentist didnt even show up to the office until 810 after anxious xrays and him probing around my mouth he told that i needed to help him
we was 6 people and was bad
could be good and bad thing
i was sent to their pain management doctor and followed his orders only to be treated with disrespect and no attempt to find a way to help me
im am very grateful to shane and know you will be too
its never fun to have to go to urgent care but if you really need to this isnt a bad place to go
not only did the lady make me wait for an additional 30 minutes but she left the door open the entire time
i dont see myself going anywhere else
i really like horizon modern dentistry
when i arrived the employee at the front desk told me she didnt have me down for an appointment
i would definitely return to this hospital for necessary medical treatment
that was really cool
it seemed as if every one smiled and was nice to one another too
great massage after i ran 45 miles
ive been going to dr dodie for about 2 years now
they count on ultimately professional and skillful optometrists
its been 3 months and i have been following up every month still no check
the front desk person was not very friendly at this visit and handed me some paperwork to fill out and dismissed me
had a long wait then but i didnt really care that day
i went to mahaya for an osteopathic treatment and i had the best experience from the moment i arrived to the moment i left friendly and professional staff clean and well located clinic i highly recommend doctor brice bonnard
its located right in front of rainbow babies and is so convenient that i wonder how i went nearly four years without giving in
im always kind of skeptical to do these and i need someone who is 100 honest and upfront and doesnt sugar coat stuff
this place is located in nice area so i have yet to use my new learned moves outside of the establishment yet
thinking nothing of it i didnt look at it till i got home
you guys truly make the difference
after doing some tests they then told me that they were unable to complete all the tests because they did not have the right equipment
this is the newly located hospital and i am impressed i came with a friend for support
total bill for being treated like this and for shoddy work unbecoming of a dentist serving this valley for 25 years 420
lasik surgery was the best money i ever spent
it was definitely relaxing and worth the 38 that i paid for it but next time i will look for a place a little nicer that specializes in sports and deep tissue massages
very nice office and the staff is very friendly and nice
das essen im bad muss man an der theke abholen und ist bei einer temperatur von 30 grad unangenehm zu sich u nehmen
with my previous nightmare experiences with dentists i sought out solutions to the anxiety i had dealing with dental care and stumbled upon sedation dentistry which lead me here
they were convincing me that im eligible for my free xray even though i had my doubt
i opted to go back for treatment 2 a couple of days later
your good to go
what a blessing
after a couple of x rays with my 4 year old
dr gutierrez is awesome
the cleaning happened without issue besides me being white knuckled in the massaging dental chair
she is an excellent massage therapist as well as giving me helpful advice for the pain
my son and i were in crisis
dr cavendar performed the redo and all seems to be healing well
she is the best therapist there
well simply put dr silverman is great
1 time in the 10 years i was called at home to reschedule because he had to leave for a delivery
it comes with headphones too
im not sure why others rated so low
i recommend them 100
he answers questions while heading out the door
first he corrected a filler that was injected by a local spa
one of the assistants will take you in the back and take xrays free bring you to the consultation room
i was impressed not only by his professional background but by his customer orientation
she never makes you feel like she is rushing to the next patient but always stays on schedule
if you are having your entire head spine and pelvis xrayed where should protection be placed
so i would just sum it up by saying all doctors are busy
it was very unprofessional and inappropriate in the work setting
we set a specific appt time for a reason
if i did this to them i would be charged a late cancellation fee but they dont care about doing it to me
they sent me home with orders to treat a uti
i signed up and completed a laser hair removal pack with them and i dont regret it
the bed was very comfortable
scott was amazing first time i bent my glasses and i thought it was the end of the world
love the care from dr fife and entire staff
as such seems like a well run centre but watch out for your pride
i was told to sit down  wait a couple minutes till the girl was ready
would recommend this dentist to anyone
we could see the hairs ejecting immediately which is what should happen when you go to a good place from my experience of having laser hair removal about 10 years ago
maybe i caught him on a bad day but it was bad enough not to give him a second chance
i ended up with a horrible scar
we would have never went to this dentist but do to our  insurance we had to
the pa was friendly but seemed rushed i dont know why they took forever to get in the room
she told me to just go to the cafeteria
i actually need to make an appt soon for maintenance
a few days went by and i never heard a thing about her labs so i called and that is when this office showed their true colors of patient care or lack of
dr feng told me that she can fix the bags under my eyes and correct the mistakes made from the previous surgeon
i have been a patient of dr strimling for over a dozen years
dr oh was personable and thorough in my preop evaluation
good luck trying to reach them by phone
i ended up going to urgent care because by this time i was worried something was really wrong
34 times they startedlate for my appointment  start time but they always seem to finish on time
friendly staff and they made me feel comfortable with the shoulder surgery i needed to have
they take our insurance and always give us great service
i went to my usual massage house yesterday but ended up paying close to 50 for an hour when i thought it was priced at 22  tipsso i figured i gotta try and see what else is out there
moved here recently have not found a family doctor as yet second time visiting and each time was an comfortable visit for me and daughters
this place doesnt even deserve that
i have never worn contacts before so the whole process was very new to me
very clean and welcoming office
i would never trust my mouth to another dentist
scheduling was easy and all of the forms are online  save everybody some time and do them at home
as i am doing so i get a phone call so i figured i have to wait i might as well take this call
i wasnt a patient but was experiencing real pain and my dentist was on vacation
you are the best
her assistant danielle was fantastic as well
i say this also reflects negatively on dr deroock bc i believe as a physician he is responsible for the conduct and ethics of the practice in which he works
the technology she uses is awesome and she really makes sure you understand what youre looking at
you will eventually get the hang of it
after seeing her over two and half months ive seen a lot of personal development happen for myself and i think michelle would agree
you could join the sports and fitness which is only a block away from the dowd y for half the price but you would not be getting the size variety of fitness classes and sense of community that you would receive at the dowd ymca

i have had terrible relationships with dentists ever since then

the entire staff was helpful knowledgeable and really very sweet
my two boys have different health needs and her specialist referrals were fantastic
this was the only reason why we chose to take our child here
she breaks down the prices and what your insurance will cover and not cover
when i first arrived i already convinced myself that my case could not be helped by any other means outside of surgery
for me he looked at 3d images and then explained how the treatment would occur
they always make themselves available
none of the staff knows what they are doing the place smells really bad and i am not exaggerating  and the patients look desperate dirty and sick which is not a judgement on them but makes you wonder how clean can this clinic be and how much advantange could they be taking out of these poor people
it saddens me to give northlight a low score based on reception service only
while it wasnt the kind of thai massage ive had in the past it was the best massage ive ever had
siri was not having any of that and started her mouth back up glaring and laughing at me
my tummy tuck came out beautifully however the office manager there is horrible
the assistant that showed me to the exam room could not have been more than 12 a very young girl and  one with absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever
the front staff was very nice and willing to answer any questions that they could that i might have
then when the dr came in he asked if i was told about the ct scan

the truth is laser hair removal doesnt work for everyone and their are factors that determine the success of the procedure
the people that fill my requests are also very good with suggestions of what im looking for
what do you care the billing lady said several times you have a 1000 deductible
i had a bad cut about 4 months prior and have been vigorously growing it out since  so it was in terribly shape
i told the assistant i was bleeding and she handed me a tissue and said it sometimes does that
he described everything in detail he was patient and his bedside manner was supurb
thank you pilates center of pittsburgh

dr millar was not only  unhelpful and unsupportive of me regarding my illness which led to me taking ill health retirement from nursing as advised by a consultant at the wgh but he actually raised his voice to me  in the presence of my partner complaining that he had to work until late in the evening often didnt get his dinner until 8pm
jason and adam did a spectacular job installing our new garage door after our neighbors friend accidentally bumped into it

dr knott has great bedside manner and is very knowledgeable

a group would fare fine here
at 6pm after an hour and a half wait i went up asked one of the receptionists who was playing on her phone and trying not to fall asleep if she knew how much longer it would be
shes presumptuous under educated  rude
at the time of the call the freak storm had not started so i was uncertain if rain would actually come
the colors on the walls are very calming and everything is very clean feeling
my medical needs were not addressed and actually dismissed
also they have tvs with netflix cable and saturday availability
whats that about
she is all about money
no one returns phone calls they dont forward medical records when asked multiple times and the turnover is ridiculous
but the far more prevalent culture of employees who think they know you better than you and are snobby little bitches are in your face 24 hours a day
as good as it gets it is
i love the late hours for followup visit and that was a big reason why we chose him
location  completely ideal if you are in the north scottsdale part of the world
im grateful for the treatment and that they were able to get my infection under control enough for me to go home and go see my own surgeon but i will never go back
i will most definitely be back for annuals and i will be so so incredibly sad when my husband receives orders and we move out of vegas

a nurse my husband had asked earlier about the cubs  mets playoff game happened by  he asked her the score
my experience was great and i absolutely believe everyone in the office truly care about every single patient taking their time to explain every procedure and answer any question you may have
i would agree wholeheartedly with some of the other reviewers who say that this office is just one that runs as many patients through as possible with no care about patients time
thank you again for being a class act
you need to supply accurate information before i can fill an appointment slot for you
i never felt out of the loop or clueless as to what was going on
anyhow luckily for us urgent care centers are something we rarely need to go to
the therapist i had was not a good fit for me
ill be back
i caught a cold for the 4th time this year and had no sick time left
thus keeping someone like the owners administrator
first off do not even try to joke about the sanctity of marriage or you might be thrown out

i didnt feel rushed or like i was being an annoyance with all of my questions
items sitting allover

came in around 6pm on a friday night having difficulty breathing
i show up a few days prior for blood work and they show i never called to register no test procedure to be done or bloodwork

along with chiropractor and acupuncture services fusion also has massage therapy and naturopathic medicine
i still feel like i am floating on that cloud
howeverfrom the twinkling lights on the big tree in the waiting room the movie theatre in the lobby and the ipads my daughter couldnt wait to come here
i set an appointment with them after scanning my employer insurance directory for a nearby dentist
i have also been seeing a massage therapist there going to yoga seeing the medical doctor on occasion and participating in workshops
it is truly a family practice and this is something special
the place is jampacked with so many great items that it is hard to find stuff
what a joke
i had a massage facial massage and foot scrub and left feeling relaxed head to toe

she explained it as kind of being similar to a perm for my lashes
almost as if theres a salon in mii home  but i recommend everyone if you want your nail poppin then yes pop lashes  nails is the place
the prices are very affordable and i would return again for a quick 30 minutes
incredibly relaxing experience
dr kamal was able to see my daughter for a consultation on a busy saturday

i was able to sit in on a couple of meetings but the rest of the time the director had nothing for me to do
starting from the front desk girls are not the most bubbly people youll meet but they are not rude or mean
she helped me become pain free and enabled me to finally return to work within a few weeks
trifecta of competence professionalism and caring attitude
he spends plenty of time to explain everything in great detail and keeps us up to date on newer and better contacts to try
the facilities at the gateway location which specializes in family medicine and womens health are clean and updated
needless to say i have been to quite a few appointments have dealt with the staff and gotten to know everyone in the office quite well

as a provider i would never refer a patient of mine to this facility
i appreciate the way he is hands on for the entire session vs watching me do exercises that i could do on my own

pretty easy to travel to from wherever you are
i traveled to scottsdale from eastern canada for a 5 day trip and started getting anxiety attacks
i feel we are in capable hands with all of dr shields team of professionals
she did not do any type of specific trigger points on my feet
theyre also great at keeping your information private at the check in desk
first off ive been to only one foot massage place prior to this experience so i was kinda of anxious about coming here as that first experience at a spa on eastern wasnt a pleasing one
today i got someone that realized if a head ct of an infant is ordered this might be a call to return
initially they told me that i was curable in about 3 months now its some people never get better

now that i work downtown ill probably try something in that area but i would definitely return here if i had a workplace or home nearby

no phone call and 2 day later my wife almost bled to death
i left his shop with the ability to move my knee freely without pain or restriction
i wouldnt be writing this comment if the dr offered to fix his mistake at his expense
what really kills me is they were rude
also usually when i think of dental offices i think of outdated early 90s dim lighting and unpleasant receptionists normally i equate dental offices to something out of a horror movie
i was one of the first patients of this company
the wait time has seemed to improve which is great when you have a cranky infant in towhowever the staffs attitude has not
i literally owe them my life

it was too late for me to leave since weve gone through triage
doctor doug and the staff are all kind and capable and i actually left there smiling
been here more than once hoping for a different experience
when i contacted the drs office to request to be seen free of charge because this is a probable case of malpractice and he should want to see what is going on with his patient
im currently uninsured but have no problem paying cash to my providers here within reason of course because i know i am getting the best treatment in the country
he is very professional and takes great pride in his work
i was comfortable with her and she was very compassionate and had great bedside manner
no reply

first of all the physical space is great its a very calming comfortable environment that helps add to the experience
even in an emergency dr dhesi saw me over a holiday weekend and continued to followup with me through the next week to ensure that i was not in pain or discomfort
you want to see someone who is the best you have to deal with that

and not having to worry about my skin has changed my life
but i am patience
dr leavitt quite simply saved my teeth
the only unfortunate side of the office is that sometimes it takes longer than i expect but that is actually a result of dr cohens thoroughness in that if he sees something of concern he will take another xray or make additional notes in the patients chart
he is always professional respectful and attentive
ive had absolutely wonderful experiences since joining magenta
i asked if the balm is on sale and she told me not everything is
i have visited other dentist office but i would always leave disappointed because of the prices or the work environment

they communicate frequently and electronically which is appreciated
that said i was very happy with the massage

will absolutely return
my wife and i wish we had checked out dr germin on yelp before our visit
i called 11 other places and was refused any help by any of the dental offices because i was not a patient
they all go out of their way to know you as a patient and as a person
the waiting room was empty
its hard to talk to a live body when you call the number
was referred here through my chiropractor due to an accident
she was a lot of fun extremely pleasant welcoming and informative
i pushed the nurses button for over an hour finally when they arrived the nurse brought over the tray
sarah store manager she greeted us on the way in and was actually the one to handle our transactions on the way out

the front of the house staff the aides to the doctor and the doctor herself are very professional and timely
i researched the breast cancer society and found out that the bbb says that standards not met
i took both dyflucan pills  currently got prescribed nystatin ointment from my daughters pediatrician over the phone from hawaii
im so mad that ive wasted so much money on other people when i couldve been saving money coming here
terrible  office  i am changing  and cant wait to see and deal with a  real doctors office   this place is a joke and i cant believe people would go here
the address palm tree pediatrics had was an address that the hospital had on file from 31 years ago when my mother had me at thunderbird samaritan now banner thunderbird
the staff are always laughing and joking and referring to patients by first name
quick check in on the tablets when you get there makes it easy to verify your information without having to fill out forms
dr ricardi is very informative and caring
the prices i feel are very reasonable and i can get in in a timely manner if needed
one amazing experience
i waited on hold for 10 minutes which is typical to be told that they were not accepting new patients that didnt already have family seeing the doctor
great for beginners to advanced yogis easy to catch on to the routine yet still challenging if you have been coming for awhile
my husband said he thought it looked like a boy and she said she agreed but really didnt know
bottom line great people and awesome experience
the equipment is superb although i must admit that im not an aficionado of dental devices
erica is exceptional
came in my appointment for facial with tara but the girl font desk are very rude never ask if i need anything while imports waiting but customer came to check in  the girls in front ask this customer if she would like some water to drink wow what happened to customers services
i have been coming here for years and have always had great service
they are so rude i tried to give them a second chance sure enough they fail again from the receptionist to the dentist they are just unprofessional
tom is a great trainer
this is a clean friendly warm and caring place of wellness
now if it were me and my glasses had broke i wouldnt be able to wait the 8 days or however long
it will only lead to headaches and high blood pressure
i bought the rove pen and cartridge combo because i was told that the oil was through a distillate process and not the co2 process but i just checked the rove brands website and it clearly states that they use the c02 process
i had been crawling around the floor with paralyzing back spasm for almost a week before i found quan
we will not be returning
i was informed that i would maybe need a touchup here and there but that it would be very minimal if at all
this place is great
i had a reading with cc and it was life changing
i hated his nutrition advice and rants on flu shots etc
and by quick they werent short changing you on care they were punctual with the appointment time and very little wait
and not a single one had an even slightly decent bedside manner
i loooove dr moore
the lenses are in the upper echelon of brands so be conscious of how much you are willing to spend
at one point she stuck my gums with a sharp instrument and drew more blood
i had a photofacial first time and was impressed with everything about debbie and the procedure
i rushed over to superstition springs endodontics being driven by my son because i had taken so many percocet i couldnt drive

ein einblick in die massagen und die aktionen findet sich auf der website
i highly recommend her for any of your tattoo needs
massage works works
when i arrived there was hardly any parking but once inside the wait line for health cards was low
for my 6 month cleanings to an amazing small office in the suburbs of chicago got all my other dental work there and was generally a very happy camper when it came to my teeth
i have called their office and have been told that i dont show a balanceone month after the phone callanother billdrove down to the office with a copy showing it was paid and to stop billing meone month laterstill receiving a bill for this lousy copay
in addition to that she is so kind and personable
for starters getting these people to show up was a joke by itself then when they did finally arrive the cab literally smelled like some rubbed there back side uo and down the seats  smh
so my main reason for even reviewing this place is if you have a choice of a different location for a drug test or anythingtake it
after more than another half hour i was led to an exam room
please note that there is a small fee for using the credit card
i tell her a i cant miss any more work im training someone to take over my position  ask if its absolutely necessary for me to take this test she says no but he really wants me to  keeps pushing me
did i mention that we have an 8 month old
she was extremely thorough and i really felt like she had my best interest at heart
he said that percentage would improve in the next several hours
my wife and i have attended numerous classes with deena and her staff from birthing class to prenatal yoga
they pretty much rely on uninformed customers and take advantage of them
i came in for the 30 deep tissue and it was surprisingly amazing
i am a 66 year old male moved here from texas in may 2016 and did not have a pcp
they supply some but half way through i had one pop out which interrupted relaxation
i find the front desk to be rude short and very condescending
i have to say that the massage i received from wendy was hands down the best massage ive ever gotten
she would not release me to see another doctor prior to the surgery
i would definitely recommend hankins and sohn to others
she does not have a good bedside manner and even made me feel like i was bothering her at times
linda is a master of her craft
another amazing delivery by dr nelson
i explained what i do for a living and we both had a good conversation which made me feel he was tentative to his patients
dr cooper is really amazing
the nurses  doctors were all great  treated me like a guest more than a patient
like sj from queen creek i purchased a year of facials from groupon talked about microdermabrasion high frequency  electrode facial  galvanic current facelifts so expect to get all of these but i arrived and they were running at least 12hr behind
the bathroom was a nightmare too
love that im seen immediately
she finally realized that id now then been laboring to breathe for over 6 hours was exhausted in pain and had no more patience and turned the air down
strongly recommend aary dental
the dr came back performed the ultra sound found nothing
so normally what i do is  once a year i shell out 20000  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses paying cash
this was my clue for the first time that no pain medicine would be administered
their clinic is very clean and relaxing
they are nice sometimes and sometimes not so kuch
one is a controlled substance so i cant get refills i have to come in monthly
worst place dont go
i will be using dr flint
just wanted to reiterate that i love this dental practice and am still coming here and will continue to for the foreseeable future
im looking forward to getting a fill already
the surgery went without incident
definitely coming back here

i would still take my son here just for the doctor
shes asian dr very good
the waiting room was empty and now i know why
they are knowledagble and very courteous to me the patient
its never crowded and smiles are everywhere
the cost was fantastic it allowed me to get something very expensive done for a lot less than i had expected
office visit and the insurance will not pay for it
lady couldnt get the straw in his arm jabbed him twice and to no success
she was so gracious and still honored the groupon i had bought
she treats every child as if heshe were her own and has high expectations for the overall outcome of the treatment plan
this is the best urgent care in town
my daughters female therapist was rude matter of fact and harsh
2nd degree burns
everything seemed totally fine and then it was like he snapped from a long day
getting more work done next month
i cant imagine that these dentists are so good that they deserve over three times the usual and customary fees
chelsea was incredibly patient and offered great feedback
after my family member and i complained to the hospital about a delay in testing and not having fresh food immediately after ending a very long fast the hospital responded and assured us that they would take our complaint seriously and discuss the matter with the appropriate department heads in order to fix any problem in communication etc
they dont deserve your money
that is about the best i have seen
when i first arrived at sears i received a call from the rep she told me the systems were finally up and asked for my card again
i dont know at this point and i wouldnt see her

the staff is very friendly and was very welcoming
i will be back soon
i wish i could remember the ultrasound techs name because she was so great but im notoriously awful with names
i was satisfied with my visit and ill be back for my follow up appointment
he didnt even turn around to look at me while talking to me
this place is not worth the money
i called for an appointment as a new patient
she offers a free introductory class every saturday at noon
i was taken back to the room and when i declined the xrays due to a possible pregnancy scare the dental hygienist stated they would not clean my teeth unless they had them
she addresses muscular issues with focus and treats you like an individual instead just another customer
the vibe was awesome and when i had to bring my little girls in they always entertained until i was done
she said well this is a sports medicine clinic
im just as happy if not more so with my tummy tuck
the massage experience was very average
go here  if you are looking for a great haircut or color this is the place to go
the last thing on out minds is a sales person but when you bring it up it just puts a bad taste in your mouth
i am confident in dr richards skill and trust his medical judgement
ill start from the date of my free lasik consultation taylor the counselor was very helpful in explaining the difference between lasik and prk and which one i was a candidate for

so i was now looking for a new dr again
i have had everything from skin cancer screening and spots tested to injectables i look forward to my next appt
2 value  the thoughtfulness of the design and quality of construction exceeded that of any of the 8 other glasses retailer i visited 3 service  they know their stuff and are very friendly
it grew a substantial amount over the past 5 years
im a big fan of purple and love the fact that the walls are that color
great equipment and weekly posted workouts to try
i no longer visit adina for what was a chronic battle at one time because i no longer have flareups again thanks to her care attention and overall thoughtfulness
dr parsanko is really nice
this took one hour of them being on the phone with corp  the owner
i cant recommend this office enough
like 5 seconds later she comes storming in and i jokingly say that was fast

there is a wonderful woman that does massage there as well that is great

very courteous knowledgeable staff
i said no
the facility is beautiful and clean they have flexible hours and you even get a free vitamin shot if you refer someone or fill out their survey
people vomiting in waiting room and guy with bleeding hand
not a funny one though
when you see dr justo he always greets you with a warm smile and a hug
two of my friends and i came in around 3pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were brought in
its nicer looking than the ones in chinatown because you have partial cubbies with a curtain to close the room rather than wall partitions they use a humidifier and they have hot stones or scented oil options
unfortunately i had to go back for them to bond the crown  i had already paid
i should have been given a rx for the full 28 days therapy
we joked saying we could be richard if it meant we get the xray faster
i sent my husband and son first and they both really liked dr huey so it was my turn
ive been w dr woodson for 45 years now and i cant remember how many times his staff have turned over
she massage my left arm but she forgot my right arm
i recommend todays dental and oral surgery to everyone
i called back to the urgent care to ask if we could get something that would work prescribed because this isnt right or working
we found thatvat las ventanas
the last time i went i could barely walk without a limp going in because my achilles was so sore and after they did their work the next day it was like nothing had ever been injured
so after taking information from my peers i went to the interwebs and started searching and searching
two things differentiate dr silver from your average physician
ive also occasionally trained with his newest trainer tyler who is excellent
i truly love sheila tack and would recommend her to any woman looking for a doctor

best price in town
when no fax was sent the next day feb 28 he called again and got the same lineit will be sent within 24 hours
my dental hygienist is michelle and i cannot begin to say how wonderful and caring she is
the front desk staff was super polite and helpful
it was wonderful
i dont know their requirements for their aestheticians however if i was the owner i would want someone more experienced
machines were kinda gross though
while half asleep
dr schmitt herself is good at what she does
who am i kidding it was definitely me because i didnt have to get my teeth cleaned
he told me it would be another 49
the doctors are great
i went with this company the second time because the first doc would not give me a break the second time around
like she didnt know what else to say
this is very poor care for patients to give no advance notice even though they admitted theyve known for at least a month
i love that they do a throughly eye exam and font rush doing it
ive been coming to dr kline for over 30 years
the billing department will not setup payment plans and will send you to collections regardless of your willingness to work with them
hands down best childrens dentist in town
they fit me in right away and found the problem immediately
also this brainiac advised in a condescending way that my insurance coverage needed to be verified and since they were located on the east coast which she reminded me is 3 hours ahead theyre closed
the old color still looks red itll take time to not be strawberry
i would very highly recommend he and his team
they made me very comfortable and made me feel very welcome
i even came back for a second consultation just to be sure
management makes themselves available to address any issues a patient may have
this location is amazing
i will never want any of my family members any of them to come here
even though i now think dr kelly is a tool i cant be upset with the support staff
in fact it wasnt until i was on the cat scan itself that the technician told me about the contrast injection i was about to receive
as an upside  early morning staff is friendly  which is saying something
the office was helpful and nice from scheduling the initial appt to walking out the door after ordering my contacts
but she just continued to insist
had the worst emergency room experience of my night last night at banner good sam
both keira and kevin are friendly and professional as well
good to go
that did not happen
from time he got there to back home 3 hours not bad at all
my son actually had a great time and asked multiple times to return to his dentist
it was great talking to one of the girls who works there and hearing her feedback
i did not have an appt this morning so i arrived at 645 am
eventually i said i would pay it grudgingly and i grab my wallet out to pay cash
staff has always been accommodating
i have been seeing dr campbell for almost a year and a half and have had nothing but excellent care
do not trust your dentist
their technology is stateoftheart
people have jobs too i never really see anyone in his office but always end up waiting about a half hour to see the dr  then maybe 1520 minutes in the exam room
after this woman left the room the doctor dentist came in and told me that they would not be able to do the cleaning since my teeth were in bad shapeummmmm what
dr stewart was awesome
extremely caring practice
im worried now i may get a bill from the other couple
they literally came and called me back right on the minute of my appointment
do yourself a favor and go anywhere but here
their office is easy to find and parking is also easy
now our son is doing so much better because he was able to get a swift diagnosis and acceptance into the necessary services he needs
he was so patent and genital
although some parts werent painfree it was worth dealing with it because there were very tense spots that needed to be relieved
i was very happy with it
also a good way of preventing germs in the waiting room
cmc also saw my brother the same day as a walk in without insurance for only 50 and addressed his health concerns
i love my dentist dr jensby
apparently based on dr weiners reaction to my criticism he doesnt believe he operates in the real world
i am not going to go into to too many personal details but she heard me out re some of my medicationsmedical conditions and made a huge exception at her discretion to help me out
throughout i tried calming her rubbing her legs etc all the while they were scolding her for being so unruly
i had a positive experience here
i have money to pay for it
our father has the same exact insurance as we do but for some reason they like to charge us triple what he pays for the same service copay
i was referred to this wellness center when i got rearended in my car a couple of months back these people are really friendly and seem so honest they have worked diligently with me and my work schedule to get me in i would highly recommend them and i plan on becoming a patient longterm with them for wellness
its been two weeks and nothing
it was a huge success
instead of going home that morning we didnt leave until 4 pm
after reading the few reviews on here i was on the fence about keeping my appointment with dr rothim so glad that i did
so far i like it
i highly recommend coming here if you are considering getting your legal marijuana card and seeing dr weingrow about it
i also should mention that we went to our local no frills near our house and they said that they have no such policy and that wed be more than welcome to buy any amount of items as it would be less stocking of shelves for their store
they always have been
weve been very happy with this clinic
we were in and out by 3pm with answers to my pain and an immediate plan of attack as well as a backup plan if the first didnt work
i had only really experienced yoga studios where fitness was the primary concern but the feel here is more spiritual and healthoriented rather than just fitness
whether you are seeking a full body transformation or if you are a competition athlete you will find a home here
sometimes even better than what you can find online
but wait you only want a few pictures
becca is so great at helping determine if insurance will cover things
everyone was in meetings
i love this practice
i always have goals and accomplish them with her
after reading these posts im now wondering if it is their way of making more money
go somewhere else
super cooli wish i lived closer
i really appreciated the fact that he had my best interest in mind
except for the person doing the stress test
typical of most dentists it seems like the hygienist does most of the work at a regular visit
you never knew if you were going to die because they wanted to save money
last tuesday i went in for my usual adjustment as he was doing the side adjustment i felt something kind of twinge but it was not unusual to be in a little pain after his adjustments  so  he finished and i left
charles small is amazing
i just need to check in with a doctor every month or so for 1020min to make sure i am still feeling well give a quick update on my life and get a refill on my meds or adjust them if needed

i waited for two hours to be seen by a doctor and it was only because i told them i was leaving and that the wait was completely unacceptable
you can see the nasty syringe pic i left on yelp
some may view their approach as attentive but what i witnessed went way too far
marissa is uniquely gifted and talented at what she does
she was nice but overly excited and nosy with her questionnaire of how frequently i would like to get a massage
alma answered the phone
she very curtly said hipa laws disallowed them from saying that on the vm
parking is behind building and not a very nice looking building but hoping nothing changes so this can be my dentist for a while  it has taken me three years to find a decent dentist to replace the one that retired
i will probably make another appointment when i visit las vegas again
it took three 3 full days to sort it out with his staff
not at any other time i had the masseur given me so much attention she even gotten me two heat pads one for my neck and one for my back
100 no way around it

great very friendly doctors that i really loved working with

it says from 10am10pm everyday at least a call or something to let me know they were going to close early and reschedule
ill be back again
welch  were nice enough and performed good work i guess but the ethics and conduct of the business side of their business unfortunately overshadowed any good here
the staff sees me as a friend but not a patient
it is everything i wanted in a dental office and more
when we got there they told us oh you cant go off the prices online its actually 150
she loves what she does and isnt afraid to look for sore spots and give extra treatments while youre there
had i got a bill from that dept it would have been covered by insurance
rachel the physical therapist is awesome and if she ever moves to a facility that was meant for pt then id see her in a heartbeat
i want to remind this office that the receptionist is the first point of contact and if a person has a bad experience with the person over the phone then they will assume that the inoffice experience is the same and they wont bother making an appointment
took my daughter with strep strep makes her vomit to honor health on sunday 313 just 3 or 4 minutes after they opened

ive been going here for years and continue to go here
she went over my treatment plan and made suggestions to save me money and appointments
not the first time eitherthey leave you waiting for hours before they see you the doctors or np
other than that i am very happy to have found them
several months later i received a bill for a 10000  the office billed my insurance company for a minor surgery when the doctor took a sample of my freckle and now i had to pay out of pocket for it
i couldnt be happier as i receive compliments on my face daily
its more of a therapy kind of place as opposed to a meditative environment i think that will help explain the different experiences people have
if youre looking for more than just a quick rub down and really need some tlc i suggest this place
very clean and professional office
enough saidgo to another location unless you enjoy wasting money
i truly wish i had never gone to the place
they spoke oneonone a few times and i appreciated the fact that she respected him as the partner he is

finally 2 hours later i called back and the nurse tells me oh sorry we got busy
husband came in with severe back pain
he looks forward to the balloon sword they always make him spinning the wheel and earning a token for the prize dispensers
theres a walgreens pharmacy right there in the plaza that just happens to be my pharmacy so that worked out great
the office is beautifully decorated  modern chic and inviting
ive been here before because it is close to home and twice have ended up with a massage therapist who just stepped out for a cigarette and then started the massage by rubbing nicotinescented hands and breathing cigarette smoke on my face
and being punctual to the mandatory video screening
after being left to sit in one of the rooms for more than an hour after the scheduled appointment time we went looking for the doctor in the hallway
but id end your relationship there
she did an excellent job
it was suggested i come 2 or 3 times a week for a couple of weeks just because the pain had been so bad
i called to find out that they never did the other two
in all my years of going for chiropractic needs i have never found a more positive and productive chiropractor office and most importantresults
i have always had good teeth only one cavity my whole life and they told me i had not only a cavity but needed two root canals and a deep cleaning also
but as far as those deals are concerned they are really affordable
its a combo of mental and physical will power
i wont go anywhere else for my gel manicures
dr ramos and the staff were so friendly and able to accomodate me even though i have a tough work schedule
do yourself a favor and go to a different hospital
the on site pharmacy is a save but i think they charge 15 on everything
also very frustrating this visit felt like a complete waste of my time and money

im very grateful to them for taking such good care of me
the physiotherapists here are very knowledgeable and skilled
ive been seeing dr goldman for more than 10 yrs  very happy with him and his staff
for example antiglare and a lens warranty were added by the staff member automatically so i had to actually stop them and object to individual services which they then tried to convince me to get anyway
now im flying to vegas to help my parents get home
25 minutes went by when his assistant finally came back in along with doctor montoya
i cannot comment on her actual  diagnosis
well thats not really the problem a crown should last more than 2 year and no i was not hard on my teeth
i love wirig orthodontics
he has a kind manner and i do feel like a valued customer
so what makes it different from a traditional massage
my daughter had braces put on today
i saw him on a lienonce he knew he was going to get paid he dropped me as a patient
still waiting for a call back from his office
he used to be at lenscrafters at city north then moved down here which stinks but its worth it to keep him as my eye doctor
not some crappy overworked mat that i got from renting at other studios
as i said in my previous review attendance is a personal and financial commitment
dr kang is the greatest
this should not be this way
i always feel great after a massage session at synergy
and the remedies and treatments will be as natural as possible
it will blow your mind how much alignment can be fixed and pain relieved even in just one session with these masters
then you make appointments and spend several hours waiting for them to see you only to find out that they dont even have the ability to do the tests she wants them to do
i also have a very tender and out of sorts jaw which can dislocate easily
they prioritize the moms to be who is in labour
i obtained a refund from groupon so i can enjoy a service or product from a company who is responsive
so if you need to go here bring a book and be prepared to wait
the first thing that really impressed was that i filled out the online form to request an appointment and actually got a response the same day
if you ever find yourself in need of medical care and want great service from professional health care providers who are dedicated to your wellness look no further
9 patients develop pressure ulcers because they arent being repositioned as often as they should and as often as nurses document
they keep explaining the insurance over and over and over but dont listen
i highly recommend her because she did an excellent job and she should be considered the nordstrom of the industry
the docs are good
he said i had to have surgery again
i wanted to make sure it wasnt something serious so i went to this er and the doctor was extremely patronizing and said there was nothing he could do for me
service was super fast really friendly staff they accepted and verified our insurance and the clinic is beautifully decorated
talk about compassion
the time spent there was like visiting a friend not a clinic
the assistant is awesome and the dr rarely has to even ask her for anything
tommy the tech is a man of all trades
i highly recommend her for skin care concerns
he walked me through everything making me feel comfortable and at ease
dr jason setlock was incredible as was his assistant  robin
i am rebuilding my lean muscle and have had no issues with my back
i am so very pleased that we made the decision to admit garret into this wonderful facility
the first few places i called were all booked up  i found this place under the listing for ocean spa in the mall
absolutely love this place
dr budge has to be the sweetest best doctor ive found in las vegas
the office staff and billing departments are terrible
my only suggestion to them is to be a little more flexible with your customers since youre only open monday  thursday
i didnt know i needed them
my kids actually enjoy going to the dentist
they said they accept my insurance and only needed to pay the co pay
and hell answer any and all questions
my blood pressure was dropping like it is hot
the staff is incompetent and rude
short and to the point
they keep coming back for more readings and her classes
this also isnt fair to your employees  give them the help they need
i started a new job  which i told them at the visit
pretty close to the same effect
the office staff is extremely friendly and polite even when asking me to share my name for check in
dont walk to someone else read reviews
i wound up getting a scary doctor who was out of line
i seriously do not believe they know what they are doing
my favorite thing was that he actually takes pictures of your teeth so he can show you what hes talking about
i have suffered from chronic sinus infections and serious problems breathing through my nose
i was disappointed with my experience there and would not return or recommend it to friends or family
the hygienist called me back i waited no more than 5 minutes and while she walked with me back to the exam room i absolutely lost it hysterical hiccuppy shuddering sobs that i could not get under control
are you kidding
i would recommended this office
i feel like the reading is still being experienced
if 10 stars were a possibility thats how i would rate them
however i would not be able to see anything without my glasses
this is the place
the support staff are professional
he actually takes the time to explain everything i ask
we have been coming here for years
spent greater than 6 hours here for a colonoscopy
consider yourselves removed from my preferred list of doctors
ive been going here for two years and my last opponent was my last straw
you wait in the waiting room for over an hour every time
ive been seeing  her long enough that the healing continues from appointment to appointment
like many of the other dentists i looked at in the ballantyne area this practice is not a preferred provider for any dental insurance
they put the crown back in crooked so now i have to go back in and hopefully be able to have it put back on straight  like it was before
best dentist i have been to so far
i have been going for 6 months and i love it
if you have any oral surgeon needs thats where i would go without hesitation
they are on time for appointments and do everything possible to make you comfortable
my doctors office is having a heck of a time getting the 1 record from sm
showed up for my appointment and was told by the receptionist that there was a problem with the schedule
i told her i just wanted the foot massage
absolutely love everyone here
i also had a terrible experience recently with another dentist doing a bonding on my tooth that fell out after only 10 days
i dont think anyone was nicer than dr hill and his team in any dentistdoctors office ive visited in last 8 years of living in the us
this gym freaking sucks
my first time coming to this location and it was awesome
they seemed eager to help and eager to get to the root of things which is rare in most drs offices they just want you in and out
i dont know about you but that has never happened to me before
both doctors are easy to talk to clearly care about their patients and took the time to make me feel comfortable as a mom
the products at the front are amazing
stay away from this dentist office
the girl was very helpful and gave me the name of the dental office that i was looking for
the post op appointments have been great so far too
great location lovely spalooking forward to my massage appointment
i cant believe these guys only have a 35 rating
started off as a breast aug patient of dr edwards  very pleased and now see julie for dermaplanes and kim for botox
dr milana also stop by to see how i was doing
im not big in stature but my massage therapists always were
at the very least better business bureau should shut this place down
they are awesome
i actually look forward to returning
she came highly recommended
weve seen alot of them over the years
if its common to take 25 hours to get to your appointment  you dont understand how appointments work
i had an appointment for teeth cleaning
brad the owner was awesome from beginning to end
when youre on your death bed remember me karma
went this morning and got the head shampoo massage and the foot reflexology massage and it was amazing
cougar life its happening
she is absolutely awesome
but i just deal with it for the short interaction i have with them
i only hope im allowed to transfer my own medical files without a hefty fee
cameron and cole are very knowledgeable and skilled in their healing craft and explained to me in detail the mechanics of the routines and exercises and why these things were necessary
i also like that her office is only open monthur
another customer walked in about 10 minutes after i did
we bring him back in to the office where we request to meet with dr tenby  not the np for a 2nd opinion and the doctor notices that our sons throat is irritated and he does a rapid strep test that comes back negativethe doctor prescribes a lower dosage of steroid cream steroids again for the rash gives us a referral for a dermatologist thank god and says that he is going to send a strep culture off to the lab  the results should be back in 2 days
i authorized an 8 copay charge at the time of delivery
my name is diana and my husbands name is asher we were very concerned about this whole procedure but once we met dr sher we knew we couldnt imagine being in a better hands this amazing doctor and his staff made the procedure very easy and not stressful  they are super professional and the first ivf cycle was successful  thanks so much for all your help and support we loved working with dr sher and his staff and definitely going to come back for the next one
the time begins with a sit down interview to fill out paperwork pretty common in any spa or massage place then an interview to determine your needs for the massage
i understand that nhs staff are under pressure and poorly staffed but some staff really need to sort their attitude problems out
i have recently gone to see yvette
would never recommend this office on sunset
we got rid of witch doctors some time ago for many of the same reasons
i thought my appointment was for an adjustment
this is a large event which takes about nine months to put together
ive always went to chiropractor to treat my severe back pain
the prices are reasonable the service is professional and the ambience is great
she is good at referring you out to specialist if she isnt sure or it isnt her expertise
the temperature was not warm enough for me but my boyfriend did not have the same problem
the physicians assistant does not likes kids
just a casual stroll down the halls would do it
they sent my account to collections without any warning
he was also doing google searches for symptoms
shes was nice  she wasnt unprofessional looking at all but it wasnt super upbeat and happy as i thought it would be either being thatitwasmyfirsttimeandall
that pimple that had just popped up the night before i saw her gone
i went in to the office at 130 and was out by 330 i was able to have miso soup with tofu an hour after
if your main goal in your profession isnt to help people by your education find a new one
you can always get an appointment within a reasonable amount of time and sometimes even lastminute same day
the location is very clean and soothing
the woman at the front desk was a blonde and sweet as can be
i had a question about one of the herbs she wanted me to use and she did not like that so she started getting a little short with me
the front desk lady looked me up and proceeded to tell me that they have been having some trouble with their software and that my account was double signed up one for 75month and one for 85month and that she would refund me the 85
but if that is true and he was there and approved of her behavior i am thankful i did not give this office a second chance
well finally i had enough and decided to go
so unfortunately my anxiety about a second root canal put me on edge
then while getting my massage and with all the talking going on i asked for a little harder and i guess i made the person mad
so dont be surprised
but only because their pricing is going up 10 a month
to top it off they violated hipaa by giving me confidential information about my coworker
i am so happy with my experience at madder dentistry
i have recently been reading about halo therapy and was interested in trying a salt cave then i discovered this float center and i was intrigued
they were upfront on the costs organized very clean office and dentist has great personality
i was thrown around from doctor to doctor and the wishy washyness was literally driving me crazy
dr del rosso was great had a great sense of humor and was very thorough
eagle is not a foofoo type massage with candles
she did an amazing job with my first time doing lip fillers
in fact you should have apologized when you read my reply about insulting me
her masseuse was at least giving her a massage to her liking
if you are looking for genuine health care in las vegas please i beg of you dont go here
that was definately the nicest dispensary ive ever visited
my children have seen her since they were infants
for those of you that dont know i am a disabled person with a service dog
i told her i came here on my lunch break from work and that on the phone she said they were urgent so i need to see them today
i got a bad scratch on 1 pair of glasses and the other pair would not hold its shape
looking forward to my next visit
highly recommend if you live in the king west area
so be prepared
they have valet parking and starbucks open on weekdays
she was awesome
already off to a great start
at first after reading all the bad reviews about this place i was unsure whether i was making a mistake booking an appointment with this facility
we went to chamian to see what the cause of the lump was and she again could not tell us what it was and referred us to an infectious disease doctor and told my husband that he probably had a serious illness and it could not wait
it was already a good impression
i was pretty tense and did not have a chance to relax before the speculum was inserted
love ya dr r
great care by dr ellis and team
which is cool
called for an appointment and was given one for about 2 weeks later
took my 18 year old in for an appointment
i would greatly recommend dr darr to anyone who experience joint dysfunctions in the spine and more
off the service road in oakville this store is pretty much what you would expect from a no frills
location is only 5 mi away very convenient with ample parking space
con location is confusing
the replacement doctor is nothing like dr omalley
i asked how long the wait would be and the very pleasant receptionist told me it was a long wait
seriously every employee and customer was staring
i got the aromatherapy as well and i couldnt believe what a difference it made
the neuro team i had told me i definitely had a deadly ameba on my brain which i for sure didnt
the phoenix office at metro center is great
will go back
i am working on having that review removed that was placed today on july 6 2017 by that individual
this place is terrible from the front desk to the doctors
i have gone to dozens of urgent carelabs etc for vaccines drug tests as i am a contractor and need various tests for each job
i trust him with my life
they always took their time and explained every question we always had
wouldnt recommend any of his locations
truly blessed  maria celeste perez
i dont know if he is going to be able to huddle with the docs and talk some sense into them but what i do know is they have no business sense
for 20 plus a tip im so happy to have found this place
i recommend the commonwealth pool to all mums and dads
the orthodontist should really be somewhere else
i called for an appointment and had to wait 3 months to get in  totally worth the wait
i dont know how dr saba has so many good reviews he was terrible
i know we are in good hands when we come here and the best thing is that my boys really look forward to visiting this office
the rooms are comfortable and relaxing with soft music or nature sounds playing in the background like most places might have
ive been going there for almost 3 years
hes the best you could ever ask for
when my husband and i moved here almost two years ago we knew we wanted to have other baby
we would demonstrate the intraoral camera and discuss the role of the intraoral camera and modern dentistry
so i walked up to the store with a buddy of mine after a very intense workout
i found modern milk one night after almost giving up on breastfeeding
yesterday i finally received an email from her asking me to send proof that i emailed her in april to cancel the membership
i was able to fill these out at home
called a week before we needed a ride to the airport and we needed a car seat
studios are clean and well maintained
isnt your typical training facility
saw ms moyer shes terrible
i had the the best day if my life and i have no complaints
these are the best adjustments i have ever had
one star is one too many for hpn
you get certified that same day
i think i find my dream studio
kenta is my usual therapist but renee is great as well
the woman who helped me with my frames was nice as well
i am paying for that
i recently decided to go ahead and start with tattoo removal of two smaller tattoos on my arms
i have had huge dental  issues and expenses over the years
was very pleased with my first visit
i really wish dr alfreda would revamp his office because he is a physician unlike any other
zoom teethwhiteningpurchased  treatment though groupon for 99 checked the place website and yes they offer zoom i usually pay 290 so 99 is a good deal  160 coupons were purchased
he heard all of our requests and did a great job helping us find a home that we are so happy with
she said no
theyre attentive enthusiastic and patient
stomach looked much flatter even though i was not dieting
fast med urgent care took me in right away even though they were very busy just before closing time 8pm
i have tried 56 service providers in san francisco and none of them have come close to meeting her expertise in these areas so i always fly out to vegas to see martine
i was in dire need of a massage after traveling from the us to edinburgh and i stumbled upon bodyworks through fellow yelpers
hes a great trainer motivator and is very knowledgeable
fyi its 399 if youre just looking for a monthly gym membership without a contract its 197
he is the only person i will let inject me with botox or filler
i loved my doctor but after 6 years my husband and i are leaving caremore medical
i was given two forms to fill out and told to pay my portion of the charge
the office appears to run smoothly my wait time has never been more than 2 or 3 minutes once checked in
i really cant see myself ever leaving
he clearly does not rely on the traditional medical dogma that is fed to physicians but chooses to educate himself beyond the standards required and chooses to educate himself by listening to his patients
he is polite and gentle
my son has been in treatment for 3 12 months now and his foot is looking good
the weekend 3pm classes are pretty busy so i try to avoid going during those times
its been nearly eight months and i am no longer ashamed of my hair it hasnt looked this full and healthy for five years
i had the most agonizing severe acute intense searing piercing stabbing electric raging neuropathy i have ever been in my life
which isnt a deal at all
however when i got there it was a different story
that being said it can get a little loud depending on who is around but overall its pretty relaxing
he offered to help me back to the urgent care about 100 feet away
dr jennifer m stevens
i always give 20 for great service
i can not recommend this clinic enough
i had a lil trouble finding the location but i called suzanne  she was able to guide me even with my horrible direction skillsi am by a uh building with balconies
i would never recommend this doctor to anyone this is the only doctor office i know thats gets takes fridays off
my first experience with ultimate body bootcamp ubbc was through a groupon i purchased in spring 2010  i paid 19 i had a 10 credit for a month of bootcamp classes
but ill elaborate a little
the fingerprints were only 19 and the passport photos were only 6 and they accept cash debit and credit
this is such a specialized service provider that its hard to review it but its a good one
was called back at 917 the pa was in my room by 925 she answered all of my questions
i continue to see him for my back pain and thats improved significantly since my initial visit
sure you call in and are put on hold for a few minsbut thats what i would expect from a doctors office
not such a big deal though
it is still not enough for me to dock them down from this 5 star rating
in november she had sudden weight loss lethargy and muscle loss
getting teeth pulled is never fun but they make it much easier and less stressful
thanks for being great for 5 years and counting
they were onpoint exactly with visions and words that came to me as well
i told the lady that called me that was not the price i was quoted and i have it written down form the managerowner  not sure which he is
it took me another 68 weeks to get hooked up with a resident it would have taken me 23 months to get a real doctor but the wait was well worth it
thank you national laser institute for this wonderful experience
since i already paid the 50 to get his expert advice i thought i would ask him for some flonase for my allergies
i stopped in at 2pm and did not even receive a ipad ie
it was a great experience as far as groupons go
the doctors are responsible for company policy and the conduct of their employees
my sister went for a simple wisdom tooth problem and ended up with an abscess that made her face swell up like a hot air balloon
given its so hard to find a good stylist i had to give it a try and see if it was for real
dr freed has taken care of my mom when she was alive and performed surgery on my wife several years ago
the lab downstairs was equally easy to deal with
i wanted to take him to court but i had no money to get it done
my 1st encounter was not a good one
you dont have the courtesy decency or respect for your patients to kindly listen to them or give them a tiny bit of compassion
if the clinic doesnt care having this kind of workers inside the facility than im pretty sure they dont really care about the patient that much i would like to know the definition of the god customer service from that clinic
the front desk staff was really nice and accommodating
youre gonna give me pudding like im a whiny toddler to get me to quiet down
i have never been treated like that anywhere ever
the nurses are incredible even though i know i drive them crazy
i will be back
he gave me some laughing gas so that i could relax and then he put the iv he counted until three and that is all i remembered after that i woke up and i was so impressed about how fast and smooth it was  two days after i got a dry socket so i came back so that they could put some packs to help me with the pain it has been two weeks since the last pack and i feel very good
whenever i ask if she can call me back if anyone cancels she does which not many offices do
at my first cleaning i was seen right away
love coming here have been going a few years and not had a bad haircut yet
dr domingo is a great dentist
i spoke to one of them on the phone for at least 5 minutes as we tried to arrange a time for me to come in
to make an appointment with my ob right away and get on a hormone gel
paul takes the time to listen to his patients before each treatment
i was never rushed and i felt like i was thier first priority
i will be getting a new pcp
i was already 100 satisfied with my experience and then i received a personal follow up call from dr kane to make sure i was doing ok i cant remember a time when i received a call directly from the dr as a follow up
they were all amazing
he has zero bedside manners and is just overall unpleasant and unprofessional
and they also can send texts reminders for appointments
i will definitely be recommending to everyone
what pisd me off was i had actually tipped this loser because its what i would normally do
after having an ectopic pregnancy before that resulted in one of her tubes being removed we were quite anxious to find out everything was going well
we have moved 2 places in the valley since moving to phoenix when i was 6 months pregnant
her ma maureen was also wonderful
i want a doctor that is extremely knowledgeable and concerned about my health period
plus its an upscale vibe and very friendly staff
dentists are fantastic
dr dorken is caring and knowledgable in his practice
the name is dentistry reimagined and it really is
takes away any relaxation
i discussed with them that i had photographed my forehead showing the same wrinkles that i came in with
the girl doing my cleaning didnt seem to know what she was doing
it is rarely good enough for most dentists in la who dont want to be bothered with it anyway
so let this negative review be the most expensive 10 that the business has ever made
i raised my rating by one star because the owner did contact me and address the concerns
we are paying customers with great insurance you could care less
they have no respect for other peoples time and are not time conscious at all
everything is state of the art and digitaleven directv to watch in the room as you wait
i went to get a full set and my mom was getting a manicure
i am now stuck and so far unhappy with this place with no options to leave and go else where
i hate this place and you will too if you ever are unfortunate enough to make the decision to come here
it turned into pneumonia  i privately paid a real doctor to treat
it should be mentioned there are also some awesome pampering touches with your massage eucalyptus scented covers on the face pillow  amazing
the part if lipo appears to look like a small dips in my stomach
i tried scheduling an appointment online and it asked for credit card information before i could even see the availability of their appointments
our experience here was perfect
he takes a common sense approach and communicates well with the patient from my experience
when i was leaving they never asked if i wanted to reschedule and the guy working the front said im sorry we didnt see you
theres a 10 min conversation and another appointment in 3 months
ive been going to dr loren funt since 2012 and know that he is the best dermatologist out there
after shrinking from a size tight size 14 to a size four 4 in 6 months ive been asked countless times my secret so if youre reading this review youve discovered it
i wouldnt go back there if they were the last urgent care in the city
doctor thompson very attentive and informative
they were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about optical wear
his prices seemed quite reasonable for the area
i absolutely love it here
i havent had a great experience with medical providers in the vegas area in the 5 years i have lived here  but now my trust is a little renewed after seeing kristine
after reading reviews on google and here on yelp i wasnt looking forward to our visit to central psychiatry
who does that these days
the assistant is always amazing as well
i have been to many massage therapists around the east valley and marie at cottam is one of the best
they made the experience as comfortable as possible for her
she is very insightful about certain issues and seemed to care about my well being
also he cut my eyes into a very sad looking shape
ive had a lot of physical therapy expeiences in my life and this is a really good place to go for help
they then offered me the remaining pizza they were having
but that isnt what really upset me because i understand that sometimes you are running behind
im surprised there are so many mixed reviews for this office
i would recommend them to anyone
so i decided to go too  i didnt have any extreme health problems just the usual compression from sitting in front of a computer for hours at a time but i was feeling unsettled scattered and really really anxious for the first time in my life no doubt due to constant work pressure
i used the hot tubstyle tub
ive been here a couple times to accompany my sister and mother for their medical problems
i was seeing dr brill furing my pregnancy and everything was cool
to the patients and friends that we have made over the many years the real truth of where we are now denise of 23 yearsand lori and kim both 19 years with rocky river dental were let go via only by voice mail messages from bill farr stating you have been terminated dont report to work on monday
dr adamany is top notch  very knowledgeable really understands his field of medicine
i was also having problems with a bad tooth
ellen went over before starting since it was my first time what to expect what areas i thought i needed targeted etc
huge rooms needles are sharp and the food i think is good
the office and exam rooms are always clean and the equipment seems to be of high quality and up to date
the motion was equivalent to the smoothening out of a bed sheet on a bed making sure all the wrinkles were out which i think is actually what she was doing with the towel laid out on my back
its a beautiful clean building staffed with the nicest people
they say my condition is not chronic after 1hr
it was me another student and the instructor which is the smallest class he has ever taught
spends as much time with you as it takes
what a wonderful company to do business with
i took advantage of their yelp discount and that helped a lot
of course they dont care because its not their business they just want to get their check
i havent see the doctor yet but i am really impressed by the staff
with rec just hitting its so nice to know i can still count on essence henderson for the best products  customer service
the place is clean the lady who did my service was nice to begin withher reflexology was ok and here comes the twist
i might have to consider commuting from chicago to make her my dentist
she showed up in my life at a time when i needed extra support and confidence bolstering through a big move and life shift and im beyond happy with the shifts ive made during this time
i have looking for a place like this for so long and i finally found it
was checked in very quickly labs taken right away assessed and given the correct antibiotics
you are in and out in a jiffy and your glasses feel brand new again
the very rude clerk said i could pay 150 fee for all my care and that i could send claim in myself to uhc
after that i told her i was done
i finally walked up to complain how people after us had been taken back all she said without looking at me was the guy sitting off to the side on the phone was entering us into the computer
he was a very nice guy but suggested i go to the emergency room because he wasnt sure if my wound had more rocks inside or if it needed to be cut open to see if any foreign matter was left
am i not a patient
eta i see someone commented that surgical clips are left inside all the time
this was a second opinion for my daughter and im glad i went
she carefully checked my troubled ones with pressure and cold explained the imagery before us on the screen then ordered a 3d scan to triplecheck her conclusions
very clean and quiet
i want to add my name to the list of people receiving excellent service and care from dr tran
i have always loved going to the dentist and this place almost ruined that for me
from beginning to end this was a great experience
my aunt goes to good sound audiology but she does not have a yelp
erin is very professional knowledgable yet friendly and easy to talk to
their response is that all providers are here today
the convenient downtown location only makes it better
she was asking me questions to help keep my mind off of that fact i was at the dentist
in most cases they suggest putting him under to drill and treat or refer him out because many offices wouldnt or couldnt do that type of job
do not come here you will leave with high blood pressure
its where the technician instructs you on the insertion massages tummy lightly and massages your feet and leaves
of course there are emergencies pressing issues etcbut hire more staff or please stop taking new patients
did a horrible job and blaming the customer for not picking the gel
i know how emotional and frustrating it can be when it feels like no one is listening
so i called and tried booking and appointment and at the same time as them to retrieve my blood work from last year from life labs so we can use it for comparison
i want to just say thank you to him and his whole staff for making a total stranger feel so welcomed and for taking such great care of me
being a first timer i also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions body position breathing while glazing over some new age self improvement stuff
i was told if i could show them where i saw that price they would honor it
once you step into the cryo chamber its a stand up tube and your head is out  you have to hand out your robe and you get an extra set of thick gloves
there was a bridal party there during my last hair appointment and it lookedsounded like they were having a wonderful time getting manicures and pedicures
i just left the spa a few hours ago and i must say what an amazing experience one you should not overlook
it was amazing and i felt great after
even on the warranty replacement i had to go back and forth to drop of a small die to cut the lens but even then they couldnt do the work from the die and i had to go back again
judy had me at the door with the overall atmosphere  calm vibe
the treatments are plentiful and the practicioners are well qualified
absolutely a first class center
the cleaning is more
i dont know why
first off i would normally never get a tattoo in vegas but a good friend said that this location has some very talented artists
i look forward to my next visit here
its very quick comfortable and effective treatment
i love derma health ahwatukee
i was in trouble
dr wexler is buying favorable reviews
according to their doctor having a migraine makes you completely ineligible to ever take the pill im pretty sure my family doctor who knows my history wouldnt have prescribed it to me if it was actually dangerous
the therapist trish was amazing
he and his staff treat you like a patient listening to your concerns time constraints and financial capabilities and making plans to work with you on solutions
i have had massages before but stacie i believe has been my best she just knew exactly where and what pressure for me
southview dentistry is a dental office that takes away the fear and dread i used to get when going in for regular cleanings or dental work
she helped me sort through so many options  frames lens shapes  she had patience let me tell you
it was close and new so i decided to check it out
i was so closed in backing out and saying fuck this shit
the doctor was very polite and good with my daughter he didnt identify any issues with her mouth and he prescribed us antibiotics for an ear infection then scheduled us to come back for a hearing test after the infection was gone first available appointment was 2 months away
i was having bad pain in my hands and i had gone to several doctors who couldnt find anything wrong with me but the pain was horrible
this place is awesome
my massage was both relaxing and beneficial at the same time and tiffany took her time chatting with me after the session about stretches and postnatal massage
when i asked to try another type of shoe he rudely insisted on taking the other ones out of my way and slammed them back in the box
the instructors as very hands on and the studio is beautiful
i looked down at the checkin list of patients after me who were there to see the same doctor and there were 3 people after me to see him and none of them were in the waiting room anymore
again becky didnt seem to care
it was nice to have everything done all in one visit and not have to wait 2 hours
just a lot longer than usual
i just had a cavity filled and he explained everything he was doing throughout the procedure
our appointment time was at 9 and so out of courtesy i got there at 855 when we arrived there was no one sitting at the check in desk or even in the office anywhere even though the waiting room was full of people waiting to be seen
i first was seen by an intern who talked to me about my symptoms then the doctor came in with the intern
they will keep you going to therapy even when you cant afford it
it was probably the most relaxed ive ever felt
and she trys to ask him whats going on
since then the whole service quality has suffered
was i extremely frustrated
its 6 now and we been waiting over an hour for discharge
melanie is an amazing technician
clinically ive had excellent results and his attention to detail is muchappreciated for example numbing the foot before a procedure in a way as to minimize any discomfort from the injection
treating with humidifier allergy meds etc
dr nguyen who did the examination was fantastic in terms of skill and thoroughly explained what the treatment plan was
and maybe the sweetest part of all was that he gave me a few extra minutes because it was the end of his day and it took him so long to get through the trigger points in my back neck and legs
his really a great doctor and answered all my questions and i felt super comfortable and he was extremely funny
so i booked a consultation just to see what kind of service they offered to clean up my face
well had my lasik exactly 2 weeks ago now and still waiting for it to work
i still have a scar from it
next time i looked up the wait time had changed to 116 min
he was hallucinating for 24 hours and it progressed his dementia
i woke up in the middle of surgery and began screaming due to the crunching sound of the doctor pulling my tooth out of the back right side of my mouth
i have seen a couple doctors in this practice when my primary obgyn could not fit my schedule and i have been happy every time
front agent waiting for insurance check made me wait half an hour over my scheduled mri then they said it didnt qualify so charged my credit card
i have set up recurring billing before and 10 days notice is more than enough
dont rush me out of your office and make me so rushed that i start stuttering and forget what i came in for
radiant medspa was holding a grand opening special and i received a free b12 shot for checking in on yelp
i got a pair of clear lens glasses and a pair of rx sunglasses
my daughter is now 18 months and we still see dr wilcock for everything
i have been going here for a few years and ive never had a bad visit
he is kind and real and very caring
very nice caring person and honest
currently 1 hour behind schedule
called and he picked up the phone himself hed gotten to the ofc early to open up
for sure if you ever have a bad experience and try to discuss with them you will be so disappointed you will grab your records and run to the nearest orthopedic office that is not toca
every one was so friendly
i absolutely love dr kim and litchfield dental
i dont even want to seek help anymore for fear of ending up in a facility like this again
cost to repair the temple on my glasses is ridiculously pricey at  85  and i still have to wait several days before its ready
im not going back however
we had a room with just the 2 of us
if you are a new client be prepared to be there for two hours
very small much less vibrant and bright than other locations looks old and i didnt see a bakery section
thank you dr richer
then they turn you over and work on your back
this way you have a month to learn the routines but then dont get too bored because after 4 weeks he will change them up again
unfortunately after filling out all the paperwork the front desk receptionist couldnt figure out how to verify the dental insurance
do not go to good feet
irritated i lost time out of my busy life and now 10000
when the doctor did come in she seemed flustered and basically repeated everything the video said and then offered q and a time
revisited during snowbird visits 2015 and again 2017 consistently excellent office support team from reception maddie to billing sara
however brenda seems to know how to play the game
i was there with two other people being massaged and it was very quiet with appropriate background music
ive had the pleasure of using this facilty since it was built and had i rated it on any of my past visits it would have gotten 5 stars like many of the reviews youll find here
the receptionist staff are exceptionally rude there are 3 that work there and each one have provided me with the most unpleasant interaction ive ever had in the medical environment
the crystal is a little oddbut this one well return to
i feel violated
when i got referred to austin i didnt know what to expect
i had no choice but to agree to his terms and conditions of what the certificate meant
its a onestop shop for all your pediatric needs
my second surgery was january of this year
ill update if the others come backbut for nowtheyre finally gone
i got a facial and eyelash extensions and they did an amazing job
no more pain
what a shoddy operation  ha thay have over there
i was in so much pain and everyone here were so nice and informative they took care of me right away
i love kessler optical
do not go here
ok so i talked to her
overall a great time and would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a tattoo in las vegas
i would expect the staff should be aware of how thin the walls were and how the sound carries and be more conscious of their loudness
we turned and walked away as other customers came outside to see what was happening
the doctor is really friendly fast and efficient along with the other staff in this store
i was shanghid one morning from a deep sleep for an  unapproved stress test
she has helped me see that i am stronger and more athletic than i ever thought and in the last few weeks i have dropped inches off my waist and thighs
the glasses were delivered very quickly 8 business days instead of the projected 14  the challenge was that once i got them they werent adjusted properly
i tried calling back and was given the run around until i finally gave in
the bookkeeper said okbut um if i see blood i am going to pass out
after having a long bad day the last thing i wanted to do was go to the dentist upon my arrival i run into this bright shining star of a women named danielle
did a couple sessions here found the place on yelp because it had good reviews and was close
the more you i play it the more often i need to put it back in tune
that being said i dont really know how i feel about dropping 50 each time
so in regards to the tactic
jeff has a great talent and listens to your needs for varying pressures and clearly is highly experienced as an lmt
i know that every doctor has patients that are perfectly happy but after 3 strikes this doctor and the whole valley ent organization are out for us
i know they have it because they use tablets in the exam rooms
ardon the infusion nurse is especially rude
we were there for 1015 mins when i finally asked if my baby looked healthy
the facility and staff are fine
they need to have a refresher course on what great patient care is about
i appreciated how thorough we got in regards to my situation and his opinion was really appreciated
im a writer for fox news and he is lucky i am not putting him on blast through other outlets
as soon as i asked for a dran hour later he came right in
i believe it was in reference to a previous conversation that theyd had but i felt uncomfortable
and sandra who checks us out
i explained where i had pain he just advised me to do certain things to decrease it took some x rays and set an appointment for another day
my 12 year old son has been experiencing dizzy spells for several weeks now after recovering from a bug going around his school
it is so hard to find a dentist that is not going to be super aggressive just to do more work
so why not five stars
i will never go anywhere else
his office personnel are friendly  helpful
i will definitely be back to see him
we are members of the same church and i know he serves the congregation in some capacity and that alerts me to the fact that this is how he spends some of his family time on the weekend
update i did some research and cccsn is not approved by amerigroup as a valid provider
i am the type of person that likes to get straight to the point and not candy coat or beat around the bush
her massage technique was very soothing and ended with hot towels on my feet
we would be repeat business and not a one time vacation hangover cure
my first experience was a positive one
classes are flexible with passes
after he left the examination room i thought my appointment was over and i gathered my things and headed to check out
john is too good
she explained all of the menu and answered all our questions
dr angela felix is the best
the nurse practitioner susan hawrylkiw who saw me before the doctor came in is hands down the worst medical professional ive ever seen
find the elevator in the far right corner
ive been to many other clinics mainly in california but this one is definitely the best
thank you connie
it felt more like a team effort rather than a typical doctorpatient dynamic
she said you need to say something
he last saw him in 2013 after his appointment he tried to rebook for next year
it was almost 30 minutes away from my house
he wants to know everyone he employs will care for their patients as if they were their own parents
it was wonderful
with an enthusiastic just peachy
keep up the good work
have never been to their chiro and physio service which may be good
first time hereit was a hot stone massage birthday gift from my husband
it didnt even feel like a dreary dentists office at all
you would think with all the competition in town there would be more appreciation of the patientcustomer experience
on december 14 2014 i requested to get some work done
every single person on the staff from the er cath lab icu and intermediate care treated me with the greatest compassion and consideration
my husband threw his back out could barely walk into dr akers office after just one treatment hes feeling much better
i tried all three of their services
the staff is very helpful
i have been going to this physio clinic for about 3 years now to treat a few different orthopaedic issues and received the most care and attention by therapist joon nah
i am a fan
for a simple uti really
that in and of itself indicates that they know they screwed up
she suggested physical therapy
he should have at least felt the area before trying to align it he literally just karate chopped my face
when you request someone you dont always get who you request
dr pace has a very busy practice and cannot always take on new patients as im sure she would like to be there for all of us with ra and other debilitating rheumatology issues
i will not return
ive been able to work closely with corrine and she and everyone else that i spoke with was so helpful polite and easy to work with
i wouldnt really go back there
shanna is very responsive to my needs and is super professional
i had to sleep with a pillow under my ankles to elevate them
i told her i was told to go to urgent care because i couldnt afford that just yet
that absolutely blew me away
and purchased some of their products
i was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was
they really listen
if i could rate arrowhead health centers with no stars i would
nice hospital i was recently here visiting a friend who had surgery and the nurses were friendly and out going and went out of their way to help their patients
i have to say patricia crawford is amazing
where to begin since they moved my mother in law to her new room things have been going missing
and i carry floss in my purse  if youre looking for a new dentist please check out healthy smiles
the foot massage was amazing
i was so upset as i watched my 6yearold maltese wonder around the house not being her normal self
they help me find what i want every time
he looked at the hair falling out and said there is no way that is psoriasis
i can see why it can be difficult for some phone calls to be missed 3 people showed up for appointments and three others finished  up their visits
hello interestfree payments
i had no intentions of getting botox but i figured why not just get some info about it
he then started in about how they give these special women direct care at this point i interrupted him and asked him the name of the organization again and he said the breast cancer society
the guy working was nice and knowledgeable of the products
it is cheaper than some of the other highly rated dentists on yelp
ive been coming here for 3 weeks now and i am very pleased with the staff and the service im receiving
if i could give 100 stars for dr amy dupry i most definitely would
what i wasnt told is that there was going to be a 2 hour wait as i didnt even get into predoctor for 1 hour 50 minutes and didnt actually see a doctor for 2 hours 15 minutes
the salon is so modern and beautiful
i also purchase my 0 calorie salad dressing there
my initial appointment was entered into their calendar incorrectly but luckily they called me to confirm and we were able to change the date
next week arrived and i was given the news that i have a torn acllcland mcl in my knee as well as a really bad torn labrum
they were running a little behind so i deducted one star
waiting room and exam room clean
i have read a good many complaints about the front deskcustomer service stuff but honestly i have never had any serious problems with anyone
first off the office is completely open and others can see and hear you being worked on
the burn center is just as good and deserves 10 stars as well
i guess he dose not care how his staff treats his customer because i seen people reviews of his staff but ignored them big mistake because my mom is flying into town to help me out now i have to find another doctor which i know i can not find in time
the store is super cute and the guys working there are wonderful people
kristen and bree at the front desk couldnt have been nicer
she offers discounts if you rebook within a month or buy multiple massages in advance and has very convenient office hours
what place takes your insurance information  asks to keep a credit card on file
i made an appointment and went in the next week to use up one of my many massage credits
there is nothing more frustrating than visiting an office and having the provider prescribe yet another antibiotic only after 3 min of talking to you and sending you on your way
it is dirty and the workers are rude
i came here around 2pm on a friday and was taken back within 20 minutes
two is that like mike b rating a dentist that high is really hard to do
save your time and money and go anywhere else
the one thing that was tough was there was no good place for my husband to sleep it would have been nice if they had a reclining chair or something but he had a choice of a rocking chair or a padded bench
i generally feel relaxed the minute i walk through the door
because apparently they dont
a fellow hygienist informed her that they where behind so she dropped me
cant say enough good things
going to the vet is not something any pet enjoys but dr b and his staff make it so much easier
many asian go through this and people should just respect that they prefer one name and not be asked to say another name for entertainment because its spelled weird or looks different than americanized names
do your research and go somewhere else that is quieter less expensive and more relaxing
i was really nervous bc it was my first time doing this type of thing
i went to another place for my first session before i discovered skin city they charged me three times the amount that skin city does
she doesnt do lasik so im not sure who john d is talking about
the culture there is so pleasant for a doctors office
my son complains less than usual
the staff at advanced eye care are so friendly and helpful
save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere
job well done cmc
this news coming from someone other than a family member eased moms reluctance to leave
we both got hour long sessions and absolutely loved it
my dad was gone
if you want the best outcome possible for brain  spinal surgery you must see him
you should be ashamed
dr pollan completely ruined my teeth
as other reviewers have said this isnt a spa so dont come here expecting access to say a fully equipped shower and locker room
i would encourage anyone looking for a great orthodontic experience to see them
ive been to a couple other dermatologist throughout the last 17 years while living in vegas and they dont compare to here
when i think about it i have to remember that this is a doctor who really listens and gives me the time i need not just on the first visit but every time i see him
i was trying to stay calm but inside i was panicking
just been going here a few weeks and i love this curves
i was pissed to say the least and then she had nerve to ask me for a tip
she was so nice and helpful and made going thru labor so much better
its about you and the treatment follows you home with stretches and exercises that the rmts show you
there is a nice size and clean bathroom right there if you need it plus a tv
thanks red rock
then they told me my appointment was at 115 pm staff was not helpful
dr mamook is the best dentist always careful and professional with my dental issues
i met with dr wu a couple of days ago
i live 25 minutes away and are happy to drive the distance every time
great 1st experience at valley ent
she also informed me that the biopsy is not even something that they would refer me out for because they do them in their own office
i cant wait for my glasses to be ready
so i should be giving her a higher rating
if you look at my review history you will see im not particularly giving in reviews that im hard to please
they have a staff of dental hygienists
ive never had to worry about that before with my previous hospital births
theres no need to look further hes the doctor for u
i normally had been getting 20 units of botox at the doctors i had tried
there is no downtime and i dont have to hide under any huge sunglasses
i found that not only was it not covered but was not in stock
jane is without a doubt the best counselor i have ever seen and i would definitely recommend her to others
i then waited a full forty minutes before i was called back to the front desk and informed that because i had not arrived at 830 for my 9 am appointment they would not be able to see me today
even if you are not a member of lifetime fitness you can still make an appointment to go see her
go on medicaiton and have surgery as a preventive measure
the whole time the massage therapists were chatting loudly and laughing not letting us enjoy the process
couldnt sleep chest wheezing shortness of breath the whole nine
it was a challenge just to walk to the mail box
if youre ever in need of an endocrinologist dr brantley is your man
thank you for wasting my time and money
i been a client of dr larsen and staff at shea chiropratic for nearly 13 years
this is my experience with st josephs
i just called and they do not take insurance even though it says they do on yelp
dr goldring is amazing
we were referred here by several friends who bragged about how great their kids dentist was
being a therapist myself i was very impressed by the professionalism and truly therapeutic feeling of the whole establishment
we were told by the tour guide that they were liberal with different birthing methods such as using squat bars walking balls chairs etc
friendly pleasant front desk quick and informative tech in the back
dr ziol and kelly both are simply amazing
this is the best place to get a chemical peel or any amazing skin product
dont expect any in depth diagnoses or good bedside manners though
she frequently checks in with you to make sure the pressure is what you want and that she is addressing your needs
i took my family last weekend for a regular checkup and i was really impressed with the place very short waiting time and the doctor gave us a lot of time and the service is friendly after our visit we went next door to the pharmacy which has a very moderates design
dont even bother setting one toe in the door at that place
she was friendly knowledgeable and great
spent the night in the er with my boyfriend last night
i already knew this they should have not admitted me if they were not going to provide the treatment that was needed
after it was all said and done they offered me a water or soda
the first time you visit fasic you will be seen by a well trained sports physiotherapist who will then recommended either further treatment if necessary or that you and see another specialist which in my case was podiatrist
this was the first time in a long time i was sad the massage was over
i love this place and recommend it to everyone
wich they didnt if not i wouldnt have been calling
the  owner is such a rude person
pretty much the same thing happened last time i went to urgent care with my daughter but the next dr used the xray they took
special thanks to susie who handled all things with my doctors so all i had to do is concentrate on my healing
when i arrived i had no appointed for cleaning just x rays
we immediately went online since we are not going to find an organic boot in retail stores we found an all natural hemp boot on a website in canada
was a very good set up with informative  staff
seemed like he was forced to work or something
there is nothing welcoming about it
i visited pearl med spa because i received a coupon for a free facial
like other people have mentioned they have modern equipment including digital xrays
in my own research i read how the national standard range for normal on thyroid tsh levels is 03  30 this crap office plugged my sisters numbers in a computer and because the bar graph autocolored green they said she was fine
we literally picked this place off the street when dining at a restaurant on the same block which is not normal for me who over analysis most decisions but were in town for a wedding and unprepared
the actual dentist is cool seems to be a good guy
everyone here was really nice and we were all happy with our services
he is kind and concerned with his patients and their comfort
the little snot who talked to me actually had the gall to tell me she was working outside her pay grade to even talk to me
i have been coming here for over 10 years and seen a few of the mds and pas
my friends and i were visiting vegas and figured wed spoil ourselves to a nice foot massage
i truly enjoyed talking to my nail tech
the play area has foosball and air hockey table basketball hoop and skeeball
i had to ask my rmt to apply more pressure about 3 times
he was very nice but i wish that i had had a stronger massage to tackle the root of my problem as i had hinted several times during the massage itself
they accept insurance and their fees were as expected from a specialty practice
procedure itself was quick and painless
my son sees dr vu my daughter dr king
she suggested a series of sessions to achieve the look i wanted over a period of time with a variety of products each suited to a specific application to subtly create a natural and more youthful look
this place isnt hustle and bustle and i like that
i absolutely respect when physicians admit when the work is not what they would do and not just do it as my daughter is only 9 in the past i lost two teeth to another dentist doing work that may not have been necessary at the time and then progressed into loss so when i meet a respectable dentist i want to share
i chose to go here after the stellar reviews i read on yelp
they are always so nice and they never seem like their trying to rip you off
he gave me two new hips over a year ago and now my quality of life has a new meaning
ive found in the past ive had to have several appointments if i didnt see the dr big waist of time and money for everyone involved
my only down falls so far are the kids club still is not finished and my major issue has been billing issues from day one
i went in for a physical and a tb test for my school
in spite of healthy skin care practices my teenage acne returned upon moving back to arizona from colorado
what a waste of money
hannah and kayo are the only designers at the shop
i have been trying for years to have a child and had complication after complication  and was actually told i would never conceive and finally  my dreams i thought were coming true and i was being given the shaft
i canceled my last appointment and took myself off the meds
6 he gave a prescription too strong for my boyfriend that another dr discovered one plus is that they have a wide selection of glasses and sunglasses
i never thought i would love going to the dentist
so much better than chandler regional
we have practiced what we learned every weekend since we saw angie and it has done wonderful things for us
no apology no recognition of their error or anything
while im still not sure if this will becomea regular thing for me looking into the mirror for a few months and not seeing the grand canyon staring back is a nice change
we called banfield and they told us to give her a day to adjust to her ear wash that evening she was falling over unable to walk straight and vomiting
i will not be recommending this practice to anyone
im a no frills kinda gal and this place suits my needs
i hope he rots in hell and loses his license
i always leave walking taller and more relaxed than i went in
theyre never very friendly and seem like youre interrupting them all the time
i believe my two children would agree
i feel like i am receiving my moneys worth every time
i will mess around with it a bit to see if i can upload it
we will never go back to this place
the sympathetic woman over the phone assured me that they had my brand and size as samples so that i could immediately begin to see again as opposed to waiting until an order was placed and delivered
and hes not done
isnt that the whole point of a waiting room
they are very friendly understanding and the kids love them
hopefully they help him
ok it was 200am on sunday morning and my wife went into labour
very modern and clean office
at the current rate of 0 people per 50 minutes i knew this would take much longer than i wanted to wait
i just received a bill for 3870 from a collection agency today almost one year from the date of service
i was able to come in the same day after work and the procedure was so quick and painless that i didnt need to cancel my dinner date scheduled the same night
dr emil slovak was just awesome
the other thing that makes them stand out is even if they meet you once they will remember your name
he treats conventionally as well depending on the issue and severity
well definitely not the case here these girls are as rude as can be and i work in the medical field so i have a tiny bit more patience and understanding as to why things can get backed up
she employs a variety of techniques such as acupuncture for her treatments and is a great communicator
it was not only painless but he put on a cool chill playlist so we were listening to music and having a conversation the whole time
she is an exceptionally skilled kind midwife who happens to have an excellent sense of humor
i didnt even get service here because they tried to rip me off
im having the same problems as the other reviews
if you are lucky enough to search for this review please take my advice qnd do not go to this practice if you want to be cared for
i never place complaints being in the customer service business i know sometimes things happen but the whole service experience was horrible and caused me a great inconvenience at work
the wait time is always about an hour then you sit in the room for another hour before the dr even comes in
i called and they showed up at my office with in 2 hours
susie was so concerned to be sure to even have my temporary bridge looking amazing
my wife and my dissatisfaction is with the front office personnel
i choose to allow some extra time because i understand that delays can happen when patients ahead of me need extra time
customer service issues at this location
you are all amazing and i had such an amazing experience
2  he did leave the room a couple of times to get foot soak water and hot towels
dr collins was knowledgeable and reassuring regarding my concerns
but no confirmation on the discount
josh explained everything to me  when to take what supplements and what would be more effective
if i had gone to costco this appointment and the contacts may have been cheaper but between the comfort and the speed at which the whole thing took place i will never go anywhere else for my fittings or my lenses
that colleague of hers not only was a condescending piece of work he made some big errors
often it was a cna who finally answered who could not help
other than having 2 appointments together we are not married
im not entirely sure theyd be my first choice for sushi but they do supply it
they dont use the magnetic waistbandwhich is fine but when in was completed my water was clear like the detox wasnt even done
she is so sweet and spends the time you need answers all your questions and is amazing with my son
the cha shu is cooked really differently but it was good
i wont argue with that
all ra patients are suffering due to his quit
i am almost in my 3rd trimester with my 3rd child and they blindsided me today wanting me to make 3 consecutive payments of 75166 due to my high deductible of 2500
he spent a good 45 minutes with me explaining possible diagnoses treatment options and answering questions
usually the good ones know where your knots and tight spots are right away and start massaging them out
i didnt know you were going to do that
i waited over an hour in the waiting room and another 45 minutes in the patient room for a refill on a prescription
i was a bit nervous to have another woman since dr forte lack of feeling and care for her patients
they insist on getting your ss number even though the insurance humana says they dont require it
you are interviewed while grasping two aluminum cans connected to a voltmeter
my heart doctor is one of many and all are tops in their firled
just dont go here it would take a page to explain my experience
perhaps because of the humiliating nature of my problem they are counting on me not posting
went two different times before i decided to write a review
lastly also kudos to the main lobby volunteers as well as the admitting personnel who also did a great job
his is no day spa massage but rather a deep tissue athletic trainer adjusting your body back in to shape massage
you can also eat at the triage due to the long wait time
this business should be know as the best of las vegas
i like to get a b12 shot every now and then and with a new office location i needed to find a convenient place to get an impromptu shot
im definitely coming back
the office staff is friendly and very professional
schon seit jahrzehnten bin ich zufriedene patientin in dieser praxis
hes straight to the point and knows exactly what he is doing
she spends about 2 minutes with you and then she leaves on her high horse
in fact last week i had gone in for my scheduled cleaning and my chart had called for a light therapy treatment that kills bacteria and helps the gum line
sears used to be a great place to shop but i think the writing is on the wall
he stopped frequently to ask if i had any questions and was very gentle when examining my foot
my nails are so beautiful and perfect three days later and i will definitely be returning every time i need my nails done
they go out of their way to make me feel comfortable
and that im being discharged from the office
she has created her studio for people that have not seen a work out fitness center in years
i was thankful i had a friend with me
the best thing about lora at ascension massage is that she doesnt rush through your massage like shes just trying to cover all the areas and get you done
thank you for helping me with neck pain
ill be back to see him again
she just gives me a dirty look and does not say anything no thank you goodbye nothing
no care no time and no concern was shown to me during this visit rolling down my car windows and letting go of the 40 would have even sufficed as a more rewarding experience in my opinion
i wouldnt recommend to anyone especially since swina is so close and they use the same product oh yeah they leave the doorcurtains slightly open too so you get the exact same service for less
i would not give dr belsky 1 star but i have to in order to give a review
she is amazing and very knowledgeable
he has the best knowledge and an awesome demeanor
i will never return to this place
hm mir fehlt einfach das empathische zuhren bzw
i know many people who both work for the institution and are operating a startup under its roof
i stopped seeing dr gatlin about 9 years ago i went to him when i first needed an obgyn and the start of birth control and used him as a doctor since my mom was also a patient of his
and couldnt get anything until i had had a consultation anyway
im quite angry at the huge waste of time and additionally the taxpayer dollars that went into myself paying for this useless visit and this poor excuse of a physician practicing medicine at this clinic
i highly recommend him as a dentist
this office is a gem
i have been getting massages all my adult life
so gracious and polite and they explained everything in great detail
ive been going to elaine for about 8 years now  im glad i found her
sierra is great she does amazing facials
you have a menu and you can order whatever you want off the menu
i explained again that i was looking to be a member
dr dean is the best in the world
admittedly i left the appointment just as sore as i came but the next morning work up like a new person
i was forced to go due to my front veneer broke and i was leaving on vacation
she told me to sit in the waiting room and drink water until i could pee again
he took the time to talk to her and understand what she needed to be comfortable even playing disney on pandora during the operation
i hate to write this when frustrated but since its been over a month and im still frustrated the only relpy i got from dpi w i figure i might as well share my experiences
the place itself is very clean and peaceful
i came in with some pretty rough extensions to work with and she fixed them for me and made them look better
would definately go again if needed
these people were right about this practice but we wanted to find out for ourselves and we did
every staff member was very friendly and made sure he was comfortable and felt safe before even discussing dental work
the nurses wouldnt write the symptoms down nor did he spend enough time in the room to listen despite one of the main problems being the reason my regular dr referred me
we decided to start small this is important and wait 3 weeks
since she was quite clear that she didnt follow up with patients after surgery i chose to seek treatment from a real doctor who is skilled and professional
the hygienists have always been very professional too
they make you feel comfortable and worry free about dental hygiene
it sounded like cocktail party chit chat
my boyfriend kept joking that my male masseuse better be ugly otherwise he was going to be watching the entire time hardy har har
the girls that worked us were both really good and made my back and feet sing after the long walks on the strip
it takes almost a half hour or more to even drop off a specimen
i have been to this salon on a few occasions both at their old address and when they moved a couple doors down to where they are now
see you girls in a few months
no we done need to give her laughing gas because after two other dentist opinions she doesnt has cavities
sure nice to have a body massage but our experience was horrible with the masseuse
when erica triaged my daughter she informed erica that her pain was at an 11 and she could barely feel her feet
one such staff is the rn
there were 2 other rooms too
based on that i set up an appointment
they employ extremely gifted doctors nurses and staff who are great at what they do but do it with such ease that you forget how brilliant they all are
the front desk staff can be quite rude and unprofessional as well as the billing department
i am pretty sure he went above and beyond his normal job duties because i have been to other stores in this chain and never received the amount of great service that i got when i met josh
all in all it was a great experience and i found out some things i never new before about macular degeneration and a health supplement you can take to reduce the risk its called macuhealth i am going to give it a try
the things that we liked the best about sweet skin was that nichole was experienced and informed
its nice to work with people that are on top of the most current enhancement technology
at this point im thinking omg this is why lice never go away
with the situation that i put my spine into spending minimal time at the chiropractor and feeling better at least 24 hours later is amazing
i will definitely be back and i hope theyre here to stay
thanks delete for your welcoming space you create
she said look you bleed
these are very simple exercises that you will continue to do at home
i had lasik with dr wellish in 2004 my vision was horrible 202700
no explanation of diagnosis or prognosis extremely condescending and rude considering the practice she is in
nowbe a skeptic but dont be cheap or stupid to save a nickelim from jersey so bank on me being a skepticafter the session with my wifenow im a believer
i waited longer at the pharmacy than i did in their office
ive been waxed by many people and kelly is by far the best
dr khayami is a very comforting kind and knowledgable chiropractor
however due to unforeseen emergency that time extended
im super glad i got in to see a doctor that day but i guess im just partial to dr day
thank you guys for a great experience
highly  recommended
unfortunately i have not had much of a great experience with this doctor
my dog ended up passing away so i no longer order from them
the fnp ryan came in and went over everything with me gave me something for the pain and got my paperwork ready to let me leave
angel and ashley have been the ones helping me and walking me through my weightless journey
once youve been to scottsdale healthcare you wont want to go anywhere else
i love the coffee there too
i checked in for my appointment got seen right away and it took less than a minute to get the procedure done
now on to the 2nd floor i think it was imc dept
was sent there by an urgent care and they called ahead and tried to get me to take an ambulance
i trust her to care for our eyesight
she continues to do the other side and it tears as well but not as badly
jamie is indeed the superstar hygienist others have mentioned
what everyone has said about kim on here is correct
the focus on engaging your core muscles throughout the movements of the exercise makes for a much more efficient workout and you feel the results fairly quickly going up stairs bending kneeling sitting and standing all feel easier like my entire body is lighter
for the past six or so years ive only needed the gyn part of the equation but now that im prego 20 weeks down and 20 to go as of today ill be taking advantage of dr bartels for the ob part too
i dont understand why anyone would leave bad feedback hes a great doctor who will listen to you
hopefully their quick assessment will yield some solutions
im on a great payment plan  i get a free massage every month and unlimited classes
i have been twice now and had tom both timesthe first time just because thats who i got and today because i really liked him
one goes there to be serviced by a careful learned talented and invested staff member who wants you to leave not just satisfied but elated
i definitely will not recommend this place and if you are use to ny style manicures stay away because this is nothing like it
my husband and i came in here and its a really small place there is only one dentist that works here but that doesnt mean that they dont do quality work
great work guys  proud of my smile now and no more tooth pain
i recently decided to try yoga again
now the massagei still cant believe i only paid 20 for the great massage that i got
clearly no one there cares about the health of others
simply cant say enough compliments about this incredible orthodontist and his magnificent staff
maybe i should charge them 75 to set it up
i watched her take a womans prescriptionpoor woman was there on her short lunch break to correct an error which was common disappearing into the back only to return a half hour later with her purse  a taco bell soda from her lunch break
they took xrays and saw that the tooth is either infected or not cleaned out
the was a wealth of knowledge personable and yet professional
i had no pain or bruising
they have also never tried to upsell a procedure not enen whitening
allinall getting an annual exam is an easy and smooth process
my son had a  contact lens fitting and that was good too
my husband has suffered 2 strokes and requires a walkerrollator
she saw me four times and then referred me because sahar felt she wasnt helping me as much as i needed
so they got that taken care of and i talked to the doctor very briefly and they had me then do a session of isolaz
must feel very confident in her job to feel that it is acceptable to talk with patients customers in that fashion
the place was elegant but the food which for her was a high priority was extremely lacking
the staff  gail leilani cassie stacey  are amazing and friendlyalso very tentative and really make you comfortable office atmosphere
needless to say i was not pleased and i asked for a full refund
if your appointment is at 3 you will be in the dental chair at 305
everyone likes to feel appreciated
not only did i get a second opinion but it turned out that i did not heed half of the work another dentist had recommenced  i saved money and needless drilling on my healthy teeth
it was another hour before doctor came in
as if he didnt actually care what i had to say and was only there because i was paying him to listen to me babble
called an hour ago they said they would be her by 5pm
im always happy with the job they do
most places are quick but they always leave mistakes with this place they make sure you looked cleaned up
he had been at the base hospital for three weeks from an infection in his knee that got into his blood stream
i think theyre looking for the cradletograve experience and i wonder who theyll get to do their mortuary work d parking is easy and when youre finished you dont even have to go back onto warm springs to get to the shopping center where you can drop bucks at tj maxx home goods and glaziers market  just drive right through
thank you for everything you have done so far for me dr miyamoto
i really wish they had the pharmacy inside their office still
she would continue to talk and would not let me get relaxed
the entire staff has a very welcoming attitude
the wait times are minimal they are the same copay as if i were seeing my pcp and they have all my records at their fingertips
i would recommend dr glassman to anyone looking for a caring doctor with great bedside manner who is a top professional in his field
very pleased with my many procedures ipl laser genesis laser ultherapy venus freeze massage
i mean it
when you dont make a whole lot even 75 is a lot for something that has no guarantee to worknow i have nothing that will help my issue and im back to square one
unlike some civilian dr visits where i feel like i was rushed inout   the new clinic is amazing spacious and inviting much better than my old green valley office
i would give 4 stars if possible
dr webb delivered my son in late 2014 csection after some complications
they also helped me with my infertility i cannot thank dr k meek enough
we walked in and asked for a 30minute foot massage
we struck gold
we did the soak first then got some really awesome over the clothes massagesi love chinese massagethis was right up my alley
the only thing the staff did at this hospital was blood work and about 2 hours later the staff came out and said they needed to do blood work we told them that they did blood work already and they said  we dont see in our records that it was done yet this to me was a very bad to not know they did the work already the staff had the paper from the radiologist  but yet they let my wife sit in the waiting room for already 2 hours without anybody coming out and talking to us of her situation then they call us to the back only to get our insurance information at this point my wifes leg was so swollen she couldnt walk or stand we asked the lady who took our insurance why its taking so long to get us back while in the mean time  the waiting room was empty  maybe only like 6 people waiting and people coming and going  and we still werent seen for anything at all she said  its based on the severity of the peoples conditions and there are people here who are complying of shortness of breath and that they were busy so my wife and i told her  blood clots are not severe and you would rather let me die before  get seen they even had the paper from the radiologist with the proof of blood clots
this is old town local flavor historic and unique
to see these guys
i know you are wondering if she didnt care for the doctor why is she giving 4 stars
you can take yoga anywhere but the atmosphere is what really draws me to this place
from the front desk to the dental chair everyone is friendly funny and well trained
she detected high eye pressure in both eyes and recommended me  to an ophthalmologist and  now i am being treated with eye drops
when i went in to pick up my glasses katelyn was very busy with another customer so i was helped by a very nice indian woman who took great care in dispensing the final finished product to me making sure the lenses were very clean and smudge free
i will definitely be back
the best in vegas without a doubt
my appointment was at 130pm i arrived at 125pm and they were already ready for me
i was about to have surgery but they called me 2 weeks before my op day and saying they dont carry the network i have so the lady at front maria said they will refund my 40 fmla fee and that was 3 month ago and i havent received my refund yet til today  i dont understand why took them so long to refund the
said the same thing to me when i had my mri done
dr mike is amazing with an awesome staff
i really love their system with the key card i paid 59 for the month for four visits and then i can go anytime for 10 after that
the most amazing part of my visit was the fact that my appointment was at 11 and i was done by 1140
this place is a joke
if you ever need a dermatology i recommend hlgreenberg
i also had a mini facial by cherri
also he texted the day before to confirm appointment and an hour before my appointment sent me directions for once i got into the spa
they do not give a courtesy reminder phone call even though your appointments are at least 68 weeks apart
she explained the service in advance as i was a first time recipient of microdermabrasion
her work space is petite and calming
that visit i saw dr racette

i explicitly asked them about the very total  they had the paperwork in front of them
my first experience was fine but i had to return for a follow up two years later
but this is what gets you in and out the door quickly and staff did take time to answer questions when i had them

i still go now that moms home for the chicken salad
erster eindruck  man parkt unten in der neckaraue und nimmt dann den schrgaufzug zum bad
but my sons did not
its ok my business with them is done
late nights trying to find pain killers that would be strong enough to get his pain to a minimal level
took my son for a follow up check and found out dr weber is the only available doctor that day
secondly every time you go to an appointment it is like it is your first time in her office she has no clue why your seeing her or what you saw her for the last time
being someone who has been consistently sick through my childhood and now into adulthood
a lot of bells and whistles that you are paying for out of pocket even with insurancewent to another dentist and was charged more than 10000 less out of pocket
i will not go back due the ridiculous wait
after waiting over 15 house this time dr candela didnt even take that 5 minutes to see me  but rather handed me off to a new pa lola who told me my best avenue was to get pain shotsso much for fixing  the underlying issue

when they told me which company i explained that they have been trying to bill my old insurance
i already own three and love them
i have never found the place to be overly crowded and i am taken in right away
really just for the vaccines and the dental work this pays for it self
after a meeting with arron we were told that the goal was to get residence in the proper unit cottage according to individual needs
they didnt give me potassium etc it was placed there just for the pain medication apparently
one hour later we are still sitting in the front waiting room
she never rushed through any of our appointments
he even kicked the camera a lot of the time
i wont deny my siblings can be very demanding almost unfairly but  nevada hospice care handled all our requests without confrontation

dr yu is the best doctor i have ever seen
i stated the incident being possibly work related
i absolutely loved this office the service and the dr i had had a bad experience a few days ago at another completely different office and walked in here with somewhat of a chip on my shoulder but at the end of my visit and a few days later i realize the service here was nothing short of phenomenal
i only had to wait 10 minutes to be seen
i am going back soon for my next appointment and i cant wait
told me a little bit about himself as well
they understand a significant amount of english so you can advise them on things you like or dislike
they looked horrible and not even close to natural he under promised and over delivered
appointments are always available without having to wait a long time and have no problem to accommodate you if you can make it in time
what about us who have sat in your bug infested waiting room and exam room yes crickets and roaches in both areas and you have the nerve to complain
given the response i did not ask nor was i asked specifically what i was looking for
ive never seen a patient get out of hand or raise their voice but those folks act like the patients are the enemy not all but some do
the masseuses jenelle jennifer i think that was her name were experienced and it made for a very relaxing start to our trip out of town
and she has done it without meds
im not sure how or if what she is doing is legal but morally and ethically it is so wrong
my first time going and it was very very clean and the laser was painless
i am kind of exhausted writing this review and even just thinking about it
if they had said when i was making the appointment that this this and that could likely be performed to determine future treatment and insurance may or may not pay for it then im prepared and can make my own informed decision as to whether i will move forward with the appointment or at least ask more questions
i was also very uncomfortable throughout most of the facial
dr karen and jr are simply awesome
this is not sorcery its actual science
one of the best stores and optometrists i have ever been to
the most important decision in getting a breast augmentation is choosing the right dr i knew right after my consult he was the one

i love their sensitivity to the clients need
its too bad he cant show up on time
whats one thing i dislike more than being hungry and skipping a meal for work
let me start by saying the only reason i came here is because my family dentist moved to california
when it came time to crunch the numbers and see how expensive pulling just 1 wisdom tooth was going to be i was absolutely thrilled when i found out the cost was well under 400 per tooth which is what i was quoted at about 10 other offices in scottsdale
even those dentists he refers you to are excellent such as dr thomas lamott at canyon ridge endodontics
i recently became pregnant and am unable to take this medication
great staff and very knowledgeable doctors
she is beyond rude
i love massage envy for a couple reasons 1 their services are extremely reasonable

i suggested that she wait for confirmation instead of replacing the iv that night and then possibly having to put in a pic line for home antibiotics for discharge the next day per dr robinson
i want to start by saying that i hate going to doctors and the entire traditional medical process
he is a very knowledgeable and skillful doctor
i give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam a young female was very knowledgeable and thorough
she asked if my mother has had a temperature to which i replied no i have checked twice and her temperature has remained below 1004 f for those who do not know 1004 f or 38 c is the accepted medical definition of a fever
when i got home to cottonwood later that night i found a message stating that they had a mistake and i should have had an xray
i look forward to my next one
even when my son was diagnosed failure to thrive i was not seen by an md
lets just say it blew my mind
her attitude of providing great service is refreshing
keep up the good work
i made a 830 am appointment and didnt have to wait at all when i arrived
most people dont like to go to the dentist to begin with so you think they would take that into consideration
when they arrived i went back pretty quickly
it seems like they were very thorough and efficient in the oncology ward and in the mri department
i swear i have had 2 good dentists in my life and dr nguyen is the most concerned of them all he checks on the patient frequently to be sure you are not feeling anything
all of the girls in reception are friendly nonintrusive and knowledgeable about products and services
they wanted to do xrays because it was standard practice of an orthopedic office
i want to know what to expect and how to care for my skin appropriately to get my moneys worth
the quality of time they spend with you while trying to diagnose you is not equal and i am afraid that she was not thorough enough
appointment was easy to setup
i am not sure if it was just my manager specifically or if they all operate like this but juanita davis one of the members of the marijuana diversion program seems to pick and choose her hours of operation as well as who she decides to call back
every place i have gone to has wanted a 10 tip and i dont see anything wrong with that
will definitely go here from now on
furthermore his receptionist is the worst i have ever come in contact with
im so grateful that i have found such a reliable consistent trusting talented  beautiful beautician
being able to watch television during my service helped calm my nerves and enhanced my overall experience
this woman was unfriendly and aggressive
obviously i will update this if i ever take a class there but so far my experience with this business is what it is
snacks and drinks for all ages and amazing community board to boot
i will definitely be back and i am proud to be a patient here and would recommend this dentist to anyone
my two friends and i came in here for a 35 fully body and foot massage
thank you for the flouride treatment
awesome shop great atmosphere and just perfection when it comes to their work
i would like to give zero stars i have been owed a refund of 25 for 11 weeks
i have been to many dentists but this place has always been the very best

from there he took two attempts at cementing it in just right not settling for a make shift job
i want to take my daughter someplace where the doctor knows his stuff and is there for his patients not there just for a paycheck and doesnt care about the kids
my husbands teeth definately showed a significant improvement he went down several shades
ive had 4 tattoos done by chris cap at last chance
ive been here twice to get glasses
the entire procedure lasted for about 15 hours and there was no pain
we have decided yo go back and will probably do so again and again
i wont be back and wont recommend it to anyone else
the facility is also spotless clean
and 400 is extreme for someone without an md after her name
im a nursing student on a budget and this place is just so affordable
again i asked her to contact the person at bcbs and she refused so i called them
i called and mentioned both and said i wanted to make a consultation
one we were in room doctor came within 20 minutes or so and confirmed no flu
when i got back dr raizi came out to tell me another 5 minutes and he would come collect me

dr walia was very kind gentle and professional with my 12 yo daughter
both sides of my cheeks started getting acne at the age of 25 i also gave in that my hormonal breakouts werent going to let up anytime soon either

ive knew from past experiences this is expensive work
sometimes with groupons you can get attitude andor are treated differently which is awful but the recreate staff have been very friendly and welcoming since day one

part of a doctors review is scheduling and this doctor could use a lesson on double or tripe booking
she was so awesome that i will be going back at 32 weeks
when the measured my gum pockets it hurt like hell obviously sticking the probe into living flesh to get a bigger number
with that experience i did not schedule a follow up appointment with them
because oakley makes their own lenses i was told they had to be sent out and could take up to two weeks to come in
wow best deep tissue massage ive ever had
please avoid this hospice company and instead choose hospice of the valley
besides that the guy is like a robot who is so superior that he reeks of arrogance
i have been wearing glasses andor contacts for over 40 years
the float itself is great but i think it will get better as i continue to come back
communication with the office has always been very easy and every procedure has been defined and costs disclosed before anything has occurred no surprises
before i was able to even see the dr the front female staff member rudely demanded payment for items that had not even been billed to insurance yet
for meds they make you sign a contract for opiates
the tech then began to polish his teeth
some of the most caring medical staff and doctors i have ever met
she heard how much pain i was in and put me on a short hold
first time to see dr kim at kimodontics
he explained everything i need to know about my foot issues
luckily she didnt charge me and its also not disclosed on her website that you even have to pay her
knowing why helps so much
they took blood work over 3 hours ago but we are still waiting for a dam doc to see me
however the care is amazing dr moody accepts walk ins and saw me the same day i called and i did not have to sit in a waiting room for hours which means a lot to me seeing how i have a busy schedule with my family and my job
decent selection of glasses not huge
stephanie and jared are great
so why dont you reward your feet by taking them to happy foot spa
place looks dirty staff was not helpful at all and kept pushing me to go to another of their locations he did not want to be bothered with questions from what i could tell first and last time stopping here
caring staff very efficient
i actually had to block their phone number
i trust his medical expertise and i have recommended him to many of my friends
this place is horrible
one farse industry in the bigger picture of the family law 5b a year money spinning machine
yes the waits are long but where in vegas are you going to find a pediatrician without a long wait
the whole experience just made me feel extremely uncomfortable
my first massage she put me to sleep
my opinion of clear choice is that they were more interested in my business than in my teeth
as a medical provider in the aesthetic medical field i can say that i chose the best plastic surgeon in scottsdale
they came over right away and got him and i stood there
the place is really loud so if you are looking for a quiet peaceful relaxing experience  this is not your place
i brought my 8 and 5 year old for eye exams and we have had the best experience
i ordered glasses and they took forever to come back
a few minutes later they called again and left me a message telling me i was supposed to sign a consent formoh really
its clean close to work and the ladies are very congenial
what was it
if you want a stressfree event and want and seek professionalism and flexibility please do not hire her
i cant say enough great praises about dr knudson
i waited a whole 3 minutes to be seen
tyrell is the best
herbal remedies and me go way back
lots of free weights and benches
not only did we schedule an appointment but lisa spoke to me on the phone for 45 minutes about changes i needed to make to my diet and lifestyle for acupuncture to be successful
appearance located in a lovely victorian home
i highly recommend this placei was afraid to change my dentist but the staff at this office made me feel right at home
my son has spent a pretty penny with tattoo bill and has not regretted one tat
the woman made sure the nude pink i chose wasnt too light and when she did my first nail and realized it was too light she fixed it immediately
customer service wise some of the other reviews say they were rude the lady at the desk was enthusiastic  the tech was good she just wasnt one of those personable ultrasound technicians which im just fine with she did her job well  tried her hardest to get me a good photo cause my daughter was refusing
both dr mansoor and her staff are so kind and knowledgable
ended up  being bed ridden again
staff is friendly and helpful
it is a great deal and the facility is neat clean and everyone is friendly
not only is dr koppikar gentle during procedures he has done a crown and fillings for me but he makes sure that you are very comfortable before during and after an examinationprocedure
dr albasha was thorough patient friendly helpful and took great care to make sure all my questions and concerns were addressed
even though i didnt get to continue my breastfeeding adventure im glad i got the time i did thank you amey for your help
this is a great idea to offer up at an event  it was a huge hit
the flowers are not my favoritre the prices are a bit high for a decent smoke and if you want some super dank its 20 dollars a gram  what is this high school
nice and clean facilitysmells really nice toolol
our doctor is fine but the staff are absolutely incompetent
let me start by saying the first time i saw him as a new patient a few months back i had a 530 appt with him my first time and he didnt see me until 745 everyone in the waiting room said he scheduled them for the same time
i almost fell asleep on her bed   so relaxing  you wouldnt regret booking her
dr pancholis business manager patricia was very helpful in addressing all of my questions following the consultation
peter slowinski owns this salon with his wife anna
thank you dr woo for bringing me back to my vitality
not professional at all
i had a great nurse and she was very professional and nice
meanwhile another associate batted in to the conversation out of the blue to ask my mother for 89 dollars do you have to ask your husband
this girl knows what she is doing and what she is talking about
upon entering the building i am always greeted immediately by a warm and friendly office team
i want to highlight the word experience because that was what it truly was
definitely the best doctor i have ever seen
my first experience was at the mesa office
none of that bs here
he never once called and checked on me after sending me off in extreme pain and a horrible state of mind
he put my mind at ease and was very informative about my lab results
i have been back 5 times since and will continue going
i love my dentist
thanks to dr singh and his team for making this an enjoyable experience
the drive was an hour each way
they just want to pass the buck to someone else
they are very encouraging and will make sure that you get great results on every class
2 stars for getting the job done and wait time being under 1 and 12 hours
can you hear my smile
dynamic dental provides superior dental work at a reasonable cost
i know im ok them a couple months later i started getting calls to schedule a physical
i thought that hospital the one i went to was the best until i saw this one
never have we waited for our appointment until we are uncomfortable or given misleading advice
one would think if you provide a list of all the doctors you have ever seen in your whole entire lifetime that they would have a clear picture of your medical history
this was my second exam and first pair of glasses from lee eyecare
and thanks to brooke i had zero issues with my stomach during my ironman first race ever that i did not have stomach issues  it was 100 on point and i completed my event feeling good
this is a very professional place
sitting between pei wei and chipotle its foot traffic paradise
all in all maybe its a bit early for a full review given i still have to start work on my tooth but the team is amazing  the place is neat everyones helpful and kind
this was the second time ive come in for a massage and he knows how to work out the kinks in your aching bod
the wait time are longover an hour at times and i never felt like anyone on her staff including the doctor cared about me at all
i have taken care of all of this now but just be warned about coming here for contact lens
keep up the excellent work
underwhelmed and disappointed because i really was hopeful and anxious to get my skin taken care of the right way
she didnt rush at all and made us all seem like a priority
you can tell he has a lot of passion for what he does
wait time wasnt too bad
i could have just stayed home saved my money and given myself enemas rather than go to this place
and that is all excluding the gym
i found this office on yelp and i havent been let down
dont be too put off by the waiting room
it makes me so happy and i feel incredibly grateful for dr corey and his masterful work
plus the doctors assistant is also very kind
the doctors in this group are fantastic and they actually spend time to answer all your health questions and concerns
another client and i tried to help each other pick out glasses because the staff was so inattentive
they made me feel completely comfortable during the duration of my pregnancy and still continue to answer any questions i have
will come back if needed
small family run business not big corporate that pushes you to have unnecessary work done
how hard is that
the girls in the front are so friendly and respectful maria answered my million questions with ease and patience
she was very well dressed and didnt care about showing off her wealth to her patients
the staff was very unprofessional
glad i paid 200 for a whitening kit from this place not
she wasnt gaining weight
safe to say that i enjoy going to the dentist
some people are just rude
he is a very talented and very well trained massage therapist
i will be finding else where to take my children
the saleswoman donna however was very helpful in regards to getting me information regarding my insurance benefits
its always been glenn taking care of us for as long as i started going
they put on a radio show every weekday morning
i pride myself in getting to know a client personally and i had the pleasure of meeting seth the owner during an open training session
ive always went to floss when i lived there and had a great experience
let me just start this whole conversation with i had extensive work done which is usually pretty painful and pretty depressing but i was excited to go to dentist let me tell you why
i would love to share that i found one
they just wanted to  charge more
it seems like anything banner medical related is a complete joke
the time detail and care that goes into all dental work done in that office is impeccable
i just came here for a cleaning earlier today and had a fantastic experience
her studio is very trendy and clean
so i was able to go two shades brighter at most
there seems to be something wrong with that
do not waste your time here
im not counting this against them though because i dont have a copayment on my insurance
ive actually never had to complain about any doctor on yelp and as a matter of fact this is my first review here
be prepared to wait
from the last visit when i got the invisalign removed the love for what he does shined through
this was 3 years ago now and im still pain free
i recently got a breasts augmentation done all the girls that work for him were so wonderful and understanding with me and insured me everything will be awesome and great
he has never recommended unnecessary treatments and explains all options if something is needed
everyone from the doctor to the staff are always so friendly
i was up sold after being thoroughly convinced that my deal chicken plan was useless
meeting with olena she listened to me intently to how and what created my problems and what i was experiencing
on wed nov 28 i saw another denturist who advised me the only thing wrong with my dentures was that they were illfitted low quality and improperly fitted
he cares how my life is because it affects the way he will treat me
overall not the best experience then again getting blood work isnt the most fun pleasurable experience anyway
and they will lie to you and laugh in your face when you ask for the truth or clarification of your exams results
i would definitely recommend this facility to anyone looking for long term care or rehab
last year i had 2 total knee replacements i call them january and june  and now i am a new woman
got an apology call after i stormed out but sincerity would have been nice
my traditional doctor took xrays and gave me meds which basically did nothing
i dont know maybe better time management would help this out
dr mccaffrey and the staff at red rock dental truly are as good as it gets
they claim to want your donation and to help others with your donation but when i arrived at 10am today they turned me away for the following reason the new donor list has already been cut off for today
i said sure what the hell go for it
dr good is always up on the latest technology and invests in the newest equipment and training to provide the best care for his patients
she had no idea
works with you on payment plans
my skin felt regenerated
he was easy to reach anytime after my surgery
the atmosphere in the massage room is perfect
we had a couples massage and it was wonderful
ok by this time my patience is gone
i felt nothing during the visit
i do break out on occasion but thankfully most of my breakouts happened during my teen years
clearly not a good listener
dr sullivan was so supportive
what i found out from bcbs is a vertibra is considered an area so if the first part of an area they treat is full reimbursement and the 2nd part of an area they treat is partial
and then today i went and got a chemical peel
un jean coutu finalement rnov depuis 2011 ya un peu de tout mais il est plus petit que le pharmaprix qui a mme une section bouffe
dr olga is really sweet and explains her findings each visit and is always up to answering the million questions i have
theyre both very knowledgeable and uptodate with tech advancements in the chiro field
if you do not get the first available appointment in the morning you can plan to wait at least two hours before you are seeing
the rest of the staff were pleasant and efficient but it was jonathan who made my experience worth leaving a review for
so at the next appointment he prescribed the equivalent of 75 mcg levothyroxine a huge drop in dosage which of course resulted in severe hypothyroid symptoms after a couple weeks
im also writing this review on my own and not because of a discount like some other reviews stated
ob man dann tatschlich schneller dran kommt wrde mich interessieren
again the reason for the one star is due to their lack of professionalism with the support staff
luckily an opening popped up at the end of june and i grabbed it
i originally got an eye exam and ordered my glasses on 122616
would never go anywhere else
hospital is literally in shambles
maybe it was bugs from the birds they have caged by the entrance im not sure
at the end of my appointment he told me this wasnt much of a prescription did i just have nothing better to do than to come into his office today
we would never come back to this office again
turns out they were along with iron and vitamin d  so he sat down with me explained everything in depth answered all my questions discussed my diet so i knew what foods to avoid and sent me home with supplements
set up a lure while youre getting a cleaning and watch the pokemon swarm
in 4 weeks i lost 17 pounds and within 2 additional weeks the rest came off
day after surgery i was 2020 in my left and 2030 in my right 2020 is perfectnormal fyi
we waited 30 minutes and only 2 people went back in that time
then the day of the appointment someone called me and told me they dont offer the cool sculpting any more
she is really friendly and knows what she is talking about
my skin could not wait that long so i took the first available and my schedule time was within a week
i have so far been very impressed with this office
i will never go back and i recommend everyone to keep searching for another spa to go too this was waste of time  money
mindy the owner gives an amazing massage
i told him that i have always had a geographical tongue and my 84 year old mother has the same regarding the canker sores i explained i have gotten them since age 12 i said despite this i am all for getting the test
seen  by dr deusterman and he was awesome by the way
now i have to go through the whole thing again to correct his mistakes
all of my questions were answered  very clean and professional
this will be my last visit with them
this is the best massage place in toronto gta
i get it
when i made the first appointment i was told that i would need to come in on the initial visit and show my id and insurance info then after that my parents could bring my kids to their appointments
he makes sure the covers are tucked tightly and lights are low
the results are amazing
i had a full body check and he checked everywhere and anywhere i had a concern he told me what it was
hah as rmts and they all very nice and actually listen to what your needs are
the only thing that probably gives me more anxiety than my mother is going to the dentist and im an old us army 11bc213f vet
never once did kitty act snide or assume he was eating poorly she was caring and went to the full extent to make sure he was fully healthy
i dont think he was rough
you had to be there at 8 am sharp and they took you in first come first served
you guys did great
i now i completely understand why she loved them so much
if you are looking for a terrific deep tissue man he is your guy
they calmed me down explained the procedure of the biopsy and were able to get me in 3 days later for the biopsy procedure
my second visit just got worse
he has very good knowledge of his profession
their rooms have space for groups focussing on different types of therapy covering a wide variety of homeopathic treatments and the number of business cards in reception reflects the attraction generated by this clinic for many different practitioners
i have four boys  3 have been seen here my 7 years old is the youngest and last to be a patient here
i honesty forgot how much i dread dental offices next thing i know i was already numbed and dr racanelli was ready to work on my teeth amazing zero pain again and no idea when he injected the anesthesia
yes he is that amazing
they have a structured curriculum knowledgable instructors and the latest technology in the field
dr kristine lyons is my chiropractor
despite my staffs extraordinary efforts to resolve what is clearly your domestic issue and which has nothing to do with us it is now clear that no level of caring on our part is going to please you
never will go back here again
then after 5 mins of explaining to them how i went from a groupon to a 2 month trail of the gym they say oh
her tecnique is so flawless and gentle i actually feel younger
i love las vegas
i highly recommend desert holistic health if you need dermal filler or any other cosmetic procedure
the prices were very reasonable and the massage was excellent
this is a new dentist office and they truly deserve to grow
he has guided me through my kerataconus diagnosis since my early 20s
sehr effektiv und sehr gut
she did a beautiful job on very difficult previously treated dark hair
now the joint basically offers only chiropractic adjustment if you want more or something else than the joint is not for you
they were so bad i didnt return for my last session
this team makes going to the dentist a pleasant and enjoyable experience
one of worst hospitals in pittsburgh if you want to wait for hours for even just a small thing you should give upmc shady side a visit have fun
he is such a nice guy and makes you feel so comfortable
all of my questions were answered details were very clear and treatment was comfortable as much as possible
with every session i can feel her clearing the energy blockages from my body and i always leave feeling at peace and illuminated
dr wilson and his team did an amazing job and prepared me for every aspect of my recovery
i will definitely be finding a new doctor
it was like a year ago
my mom buzzed the desk again to express her unhappiness and tell them she had already been the tech came a few minutes after that
my first experience was great
i even got a trial box of contacts
why chic era gets two stars  the website leads you to believe that its a stand alone spa
im terrible with getting peoples names but i do believe one of them was the one who did my exam last fall dr uelner
and then he said okay thanks bye
i heard one of the managers at a medical practice building belittling a coworker while patients were in the lobby
dr pallazzo was very caring and patient with my father
he saw my daughter for a fractured wrist and explained our treatment options very clearly
i love how friendly everyone is super happy
everything is always wonderful
i gave two stars only because i still feel bad for that guy and i have had some good experiences in the past
i called the office back and insisted that i get my old appointment back
cant wait to go back in a few months
then removed my feet from the tub and legsfeet were treated to the same luxury
sad that i have to find another pediatrician because he wasnt the problem the overbooking and front end staff was
they took this into consideration and made this first time mom feel at ease and truly cared for
i can understand some low ratings for office staff everyone has bad days so i cant say that these individuals didnt face some negative interactions
they always offer free samples when you buy something
this was the redeeming part of the visit
a few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite
im now in the procedure room
its behind the supercuts on park rd just north of seneca pl
at 39 weeks the doctor started pressuring me about getting induced
anyways i came few minutes late but they were accommodating
beyond frustrated and exhausted
jokes on them because i ended up buying my glasses and lenses from costco
i had small acne scarring on my face and he right away was pitching me all kinds of services that had nothing to do with the facial that i came in for
im looking forward to seeing him again
i was out of there at 1030 which was great for a walkin
one thing ive noticed is that i always leave my sessions with her in an amazing mood
i filed a grieveance with my insurance company over the 129
i would definitely recommend this practice to anyone with a little one
5 stars for getting teeth drilled and scraped
i must also add that the office looks beautiful its very clean
like i said we used to love it there but it get old when you would go in and have a different doctor every single time lost that personal touch
the doctors there are always nice and very prompt
the experience with the front desk is where a star was lost
wow what a difference a real professional can make
i called at 1030 and was put on hold for like seven minutes
this all couldve been avoided if they had the real reason why we were there documented
i left feeling great and so very pleased
i have not had a single negative experience in his office and i would highly recommend him to anyone in need of superior neurological care
i am extremely assertive and have zero issue with confrontation and this left me speechless
i have gone through channels to complain but have not heard back from the doctor who was in charge and saw the blood tests and could have prevented my mom from going through this
i liked this because rather than feeling like they were trying to procure a client i felt like they were being helpful and proactive with people like me who have insane schedules and tend to put things off as a result
went for a massage offer i purchased on groupon
dr mike andreula is an outstanding chiropractor
this office has been really great taking care of me so far  the staff rachel and dr huang have been awesome
they have all answered my questions completely and helped me to understand the next steps
plus the office toys  entertainments are all so nice
i certainly want this facility to succeed because of its proximity to my house
my dentist told me that dr gass treats a lot of the cardinals football players too
ive been counseling with jane on and off for over a decade and attended a number of her workshops
ciara is the best
janet did our ultrasound and she was wonderful
i won a 300 credit for this place and then paid another 200 or so and went for  treatments here for two years
dr theodosis who could not have been more attentive knowledgeable or literate in explaining my condition and his recommendations
tore them a new hole and didnt pay for a bs fee
i recommend taking your money and time elsewhere you can definitely find something better for the price
i explained that yes i did have an appointment originally at 530 but had changed it to 5 and then was able to come in earlier she had been grocery shopping and set her bags down on the desk and said oooh
5 stars for good bedside manners
after getting my initial first appointment done dr abedi explained that the procedure would be done by him there in the office
i had printed the paperwork off their webpage and filled it out so when i checked in i was called back almost immediately by the hygenist
he should of heard the very first thing i asked about the location and been there to see it
after reading other reviews on yelp about this place i was literally terrified to go here
worst customer interface experience ever
i love that they can do your labs right there as well
i called and the nurse practioner came out to my home
so if you are looking for an amazing attentive reliable pcp that will take care of your needs while making sure you are always a priority and feel important and appreciated as a patient then drgumina is the perfect choice
at this point im pretty upset but hey if its owed
i have been going here for awhile because it is so close to my home but the last 34 times i have gone i keep saying it will be my last
or if you would like to just make a donation you can go to this website httpwwwcbrecomusausazphoenixmiscswingforekidsgolfclassichtmpageid0 and fill out a donation form and send it in
she was very smart about the flowers pipes and vapes
been here twice  both times were horrible
i found all of that and more at the lifespa salon by michael boychuck
so why do i rate this quest location with only 2 stars after all the positives
the young man up front was nice and got me from the parking lot with a wheel chair
i wish all medical centers are this friendly and sweet
super amatuer hour
the ease of making an appt was great the front dest person maryann was super sweet and helpful and the help that they all did with as many times as ive called and stopped in to get me in the right pair of contacts was exactly what i needed
also they are a private practice from what i know so each physician owns part of the practicemeaning they take pride in what they do
coleena is exactly my type of girl people person and extremely real
funny how that works
dr o is a great doctor and very easy to talk to
there should be no way i should still be able to scrunch my forehead or scowl my eyes just 3 weeks after i had botox done and my lines around my mouth are completely 100 percent the same
i strongly recommend this place for whoever wants professionalism and cordial manners at the same time
i have no pain or swelling
i wish every service ran this smoothly
i am not even upset with the fact that its taking long its just the lack of concern for their customers that bothers me
so i returned to my dentist without a front tooth
what a great guy
this place is the worst
one of my favourite luxuries that i treat myself to each month is a really good massage
easy to access from light rail and bus
i hesitate to even give one star but that would be for the front receptionist certainly not for dr stewart
if youre looking for an awesome dentist you gotta call dr dan
love coming here first before anywhere else
theres a pharmacy attached and it leads right to a very new and shiny waiting room
the rest of the staff is great as well
and all for nothing because by the time i was leaving i wanted to cry tears of relief
they offered to reschedule my appointment
basically they were busy and didnt want to help or take another patient
my skin began to look very scaly
i did finally get my money back
that is not true
yes years ago like high school i smoked recreationally and partied back in the day but still i knew nothing about weed in general
amazing massage the place is clean and relaxing
so i cancelled the appointment called a cab and went back to my hotel
omg best massage ive ever had
this facility is an embarrassment to our healthcare system
update711pm and still sitting i the same chair
im sure jaz asked for a medication that is inserted in the arm for 3 months or so
he apologizes that it may take a couple of weeks to get them back
it was the worse massage i had ever received since being a customer with massage envy for 2 years
the vast majority of orthondists would of pursued the surgical route
the office has a very fun and child friendly set up too
this review is a long time in the making
also waiting was not that bad and the dr was very nice and polite
and dont you worry there are many other day spas in the valley who are able and have accommodated my needs since this horrible experience with you
this location is not closed
recommended several surgeons found one that i really liked
i go to billing we dont have that information ill email it to you when i get the estimate from your insurance co  now that im thinking about it i may dispute it with my insurance company
they also offer a military discount
also each time i saw dr sikand he genuinely listened to me
love this place
they lied in my medical records on and on and on
chris is unprofessional and doesnt follow through with what he says
my insurance would not pay for the consultation so i was stuck with the 350 bill
the dentist explained to me the health of my teeth and the cavity that i would need replaced
very professional and appropriately friendly
i recently changed insurance and then got pregnant
i love this business model
it was now 730 pm and we had no where to go with  worst night of our lives
i went to this dentist for a cleaning yesterday
as for the place and staff itself i give them 5 stars for putting up with these kind of people
let me start by saying that the staff is friendly and professional yesterday was my sons first appointment i met with dr halthore and let me say there are not enough kind words i can say about dr halthore he was very kind towards my son my husband and myself he talked to us like an actual person and not just a number its so hard to get that nowadays most doctors tend to forget youre a human being they forget that youre going there for answers and as a parent youre worried of the outcome some of these doctors have no compassion speak in dr terminology which makes you feel uncomfortable because you cant understand what the diagnosis is but that is not the case with dr halthore he made us feel so calm and was very interested in our concerns and encouraged us to ask questions i was talking and my husband had said something well i was speaking after i was done speaking to the doctor he went right back to my husband and said dad did you have a question
and her office is tidy
i didnt even have any swelling thanks to the expertise of my doctors
she was professional and i am extremely happy with the results
the eights are  around  30  50
the chiropractor that worked on me was very knowledgeable and took his time to explain everything that he was going to do before he did it
dr perry is amazing
dr mora and her staff are very thorough in explaining each and every process
this physician was highly recommended to me by more than one person
after he gave me a great adjustment i had few questions and i texted him and he made sure to respond and offer another session if needed
i feel welcomed when i arrive and scheduling appointments has always been fast easy and convenient with kathleen
first off i recieved a bill for a wet prep which basically is a pap when i didnt get one
i had never been to this particular nextcare before
clean environment friendly staff and always makes you feel like family on every visit
very disappointed because i followed dr berger from another dental office
i will say that when i came into the er with chest pain they immediately took me back did a ekg test to make sure i wasnt having a heart attack
let me start by saying i am a big fan of dr ho
ive been to different chiropractors and what sets him apart is he takes the time to listen to you and customize your treatment
the facility looked like it was once someones house
the waiting area is nice and clean
my husband and i are now searching for similar spas to visit throughout germany and switzerland as vacation destinations
first we get there in the middle of the day and the guy at the front desk is sleepingin a bed they keep behind the deskwith the lights out
one month later i get a bill in the mail for xrays that were not covered by my insurance
the staff was very hospitable and seemed to enjoy working there
i ended up getting in trouble for with my work because both times my appointments ended up taking about 3 hours to drive there wait and actually see the doctor
if i were rich id spend a shocking amount of my money on natural foods and herbs and body cleansers and other organic happy hippy horseshitalas im not so i kind of wander around the natural marketplace wideeyed as a kid in a toy store
we spent the first five minutes chatting about what i wanted and although i didnt have pics she seemed to understand what i was looking for
many things she shared with me resonated to me and i knew they were truth
durring this time i have had to miss time from work for injections they have scheduled with additional apppintments coming up
nea dentistry is the best in town
ill be going back to lavida and muschi the next time that i need dysport or any other facial services
the atmosphere is very comfortable
the dr said she was guessing what was wrong with me and then gave me incorrect antibiotics that wiped out my immune system and made me more sick
just got these halloween nails done by annie she is good
i have been fortunate to find this place
our mother mom of five worked to see her children got a wider exposure to the world
its awakened my awareness of healthy eating forces me to be accountable  is easy enough to follow
very happy that my path crossed with his and he was highly recommended
unfortunately this supposed healthcare center cares more about making a profit off patients and their insurance companies more than it does about womens health
cant say enough about how great this company is
again i was seen quickly and dr maro replaced the crown put in a new post and a new tooth was fitted extremely well
had they done their due diligence the records would have been obtained in a timely manner andor notified me of anything that could delay my service
four stars due to the long wait
then he told me he could do a quick goover with an electric brush but he had another patient so didnt know how long id have to wait
she was proactive in suggesting atropine to assist in drying up the mucous and also worked with the wonderful cna to make sure he was positioned on his side so the mucous would not gather in his throat
grand total was only 6 bucksnot bad for a hospital cafeteriaeat drink and be merry my friends
the office tried really hard to give a personal touch when i came in for my first appointment
my shoulders could not relax
getting my weekly medication here
smart and to the point
i would definitely recommend it to anyone whos looking for a good full body massage
she was rude and impersonal and made my experience 100 times worse
i thank god every day for my husband of 42 years and my son who also met any and all requests so that i was heathy enough to leave before i got worse
i thank god we found dr cohen
waited 2 hours to get to a back room 15 minutes in the back room 2 minutes with a nurse practitioner
granted most of the time it was some young guy 30 years old and a cna certified nursing assistant but they were a big help since it was hard for me to even stand those first few days
i was looking for a clinic that specialized in sports injuries and offered alternative therapies  not just surgery
i only saw her twice and she had no bedside manner
if i have issues i will surely update this review and change my rating to 1  so far no problems other than poor service and not being listened to about my own veins
had a few cleanings and a cavity filled
he is awesome
i recently had a chemical peel and wow my skin looks so amazing
do not go to dr quinn
if you want to go to a place where your time is valued and you dont feel like a number dont go here
came in from groupon and after the first session saw a huge improvement in my arms
no doubt i will be coming into skin laundry every month from now on
i have been trying to reach the billing department by email and by phone and no one is returning my phone call
everyone was super nice though
pleasant demeanor  ive been to several derms and id rate his bedside manor pretty high in comparison
when they merged with ironwood things went downhill
an absolute amazing experience the staff was so friendly and knowledgable
i went to a chiropractor years ago however though maybe a sports massage first would help
dr featherstone has corrected my bite replaced crowns and fillings
his assistant named cynthia was more like a sweet grandma literally holding my hand and comforting me through my fear  while dr core was so gentle and patient i didnt even feel the numbing shots in my mouth
it was quick and easy and the woman was so kind and funny
he explained every step of the process and answered all our questions
took my grandson for an eye exam and it was determined that he needed glasses
she did an excellent job getting those released
you then have to find a new endo which could take 16 months depending on who you find and youre in the middle of treatment
i never once had a problem w them lifting or falling off when done by her
the room was below zero i lay on a bed with nothing over me
they will stay til after closing to make sure you know how to reach your goals
they didnt even tell me there was an extra fee
had a fantastic first experience getting my new eyelash extensions by sarah
i loved the facial and the products she used
called and left messages until i gave up
his staff nurse smirks obviously having seen this before
ummmm i live in az
see my pic of her card i posted
they not only take xrays standard type but also close up pictures of all of your teeth
we both find him to be the best
i recommend this spa to everyone i know and i am so grateful every time i leave there
dont go massage envy
we plan to go on a tour again to the south rim
also they gave me incredibly comfortable contacts and for a really good price with which was nice
most of you will identify with this horrible process after reading it
for my appointment they took tons of xrays then sat me in the chair
she did all of this while my bridge was in place and without any damage at all to my bridge
i repeated this info 3 times in each message
and then making me walk all over town on it too
ill make it a mission to go here at least once every two weeks
i asked do you give them medical treatment other than the chiro treatmen
i highly recommend them
ok what do i need to do
to make matters worse i was forced to pay for this work
so this morning i was terrified about going to the dentist had not been in years so i was not looking forward to the visit i had to take
the girl who answered i think her name was megan
he left and i was put with mike
they recently upgraded the interior and put in divider walls
i waited patiently on the comfy sofa with many magazines laid out on the side table
looking for an amazing pediatrician
i call three weeks prior to book an appointment asked for the day off at my job for this appointment
she answered them all was so warm and  showed me her before and after pictures
i have been a patient at this facility for over a decade
she used the same products on my friend and i we have 2 completely different skin types
the receptionist was super great too
lauren and rj are always so friendly and always take care of me before i even walk through the doors
they got her too
i do appreciate that they comped me for my float
whenever i do get extra services like a crown upgrade or a fluoride treatment i always pay for them before i leave that day
it has been 8 days since ultrasound and still no results to my doctor
we will deliver and experience better than you expect to receive
the doctor was amazing and thorough and i left feeling good about my eye health
overall i couldnt have asked for a better experience especially under such stressful conditions
trust me it is worth it than taking pain killers
we are both very happy with his work
i always look forward to going to the dentist with pearl
she provided me with advice and offered me the least intrusive options possible
nice massage chairs unlike some other salons
she kept hitting my skin and rubbing it raw
i mean she was like a close friend and therapist wrapped into one
ive read the complaints about long waits and staff issues and i have also had some frustrations
partner fell asleep for being so relaxed
not only did i waste 12 i wasted my time an extra 5  getting stopped by the employee
as an oral surgeon in the east valley i have seen her skills in action and can say without reservation that you will enjoy your experience and your dental outcome with dr pelletier
i did not ever think to label a massage as smart but andrea makes you feel like you invested in your health and wellbeing
i love this place
but since i already had an older pair of glasses id been using to watch tv with i opted to get the computer glasses prescription
they also offer pregnancy massage which is wonderful
deep tissue but a miracle worker
it wasnt always this way
love the new equipment the procedure was less painful than previous hair removal experiences
i was impressed during my first visit on how attentive and professional  dr phan the hygenist  and the staff were
ive found my life long dentist
this hospital has gone through some changes over recent years but one things for certain the staffs dedication and commitment to the healthcare and advocacy of those people and communities served is inspiringkeep up the good works
he really took the time to talk to me and then adjusted everythingnot just my neck and back but arms hands legs feetawesome
i wish i had found her sooner
i know that shethey offer all types of massages including the hot stones etc
now they have more locations i will try the on near my house
needless to say things just got worse from there
fine sure great
even my  mom  goes to the practice and she lives in atlanta and schedules her trips around her dental work
its 5 stars now
my step dad died a few days ago his death and the horrible circumstances were totally made worse and brought on years sooner because of the disastrous treatment he received at palm valley
way too often
my eyes looked more awake and i was happy to not have to wear mascara for weeks to come or even go out without makeup
she is phenomenal
the cna director not sure of her title would consistently lie about things and encouraged her staff to do the same
i am waiting
we waited 8 hours i kept telling them my husband needs to lay down
i went on to tell her if a tv fell on his head he most likely wouldnt be alive being that hes 2 and they weigh a lot and that if im bringing him to the er for an ear infection why wouldnt i bring him in for that
i almost dont have the heart to write this review but i feel i need to for the sake of everyone else
doc is knowledgeable professional caring and thorough
she shuffled around through the paperwork and pulled out 8 vials for the draw and i joked that after taking that much blood they would owe me a cookie and some orange juice
close to 50 days later shes still goin
they hate when i use those terms they insist that i am a patient and they are a practice
makes cleanings easy peasy
i lost exactly zero inches
it is extremely disrespectful to keep your patients waiting just so you can over book and make more money
avoid this hospital at all cost
which is after breakfast
not only is she a great chiropractor but an awesome person
she is also very intuitive and in tune with exactly what you need
unsurprisingly they use a call center somewhere across the country
within the last week my pain has decreased substantially and i feel much better
the entire staff is so kind and professional
love love love dr
i just wish i would have flown back to philly back to my doctor who cares and would have fixed his mistakes
they all went over exactly what to expect and gave me an estimate for extra work i needed but no pressure what so ever to get it done or make an appointment
i have red hair and was worried that my brows wouldnt look naturalbut they do
i have seen other chiropractors that were borderline scary in the past so prior to going to crc i was a little nervous and honestly almost skeptic to the practice as a whole
the first two times i was disconnected
hes prescribed medication when needed and follows up with regular appointments to ensure that i am a healthy patient
i left my work and went in with excruciating throat pain that the np knew about very clearly as my chief complaint
this is my first visit to medpost

i dont typically write these but this was an exceptionally horrible experience

the idiot botched the job and left me needing to have two additional knee surgeries in the following 7 months
once in the morning right at open and the second time on a wednesday around 8p
dr arvin did the exact opposite he looked at my teeth and asked me what was troubling me and gave his most honest feedback of how to fix it

dr fish extracted my wisdom teeth over 10 years ago my husbands 8 years ago and yesterday my daughters
i was impressed that they also had a sonora quest lab on site and pharmacy
i cant say enough about the great people at the office
i kept explaining to the staff that my under arm hair was still growing and i constantly had to shave
nett lustig kompetent
as a retired denturist i know a lot about dentistrythis dr is on the very top shelf of professionals
i would recommend them for my family etc
you dont have to be the doctor to do that
yep its test time
i asked why there is an infection if the tooth is now dead and they said that either all the infection was not removed or cleaned out or that perhaps a file was left behind in a canal
nim is a food delivery service in toronto
we paid optima 5k and they had us doing everything and hello we arent tax people and what was the point of paying them
while my husband and i were trying to remain calm they actually frightened us more
yes i know not high enough to be considered a fever
if you want a company that is on top of things go with them
my wife and i both had our procedures here and both whole heatedly recommend lasikplus
i would absolutely recommend these services to anyone
his nurse called quickly after he received my email and asked me to come in on wednesday to discuss treatment options
i highly recommend dr schneider of acacia endodontics
i have 1 more drain to come out on monday
it was clean i guess
im surprised by the negative review
who answered with a kind of attitude
so my appointment consisted of an adjustment and tens
if they let me choose again i will choose summerlin hospital again
they have everything from very cheap to very not cheap frames
dr matt as his patients call him is absolutely wonderful
honestly i was safer alone in a room full of weapons than with most of the other patients
he laughed at almost everything i said
there is no doubt in my mind that her care will keep me safe which is really what matters most
they offer so many services with state of the art equipment
i dont know how he does it
i love this place
her staff is very friendly and makes me not dread going to the dentist
i have had several appointments with dr mcneely and i have left always like i was treated with care
we were on vacation from alabama and he found the problem that had been bothering my wife for over a year and fixed it
by the end of the appointment i knew that if anyone was going to do my surgery that it would be dr wilson less than a month later i began the process of getting implants done
it was so ghetto
today 24 hours after i was in their office i received a phone call from samantha at the front desk who said jimbo wanted her to call me to see how i was feeling
heck yes i want a sooner appointment
drmeisami was gentle and caring
he has done wonders with my left knee
at the end they let her get a gift out of a treasure box which she thought was the greatest thing
my results are amazing
and other than one scheduling mishap i am quite happy with camelback womens health
i could imagine this being very hard for someone that is not flexible
she made me wait 30 minutes despite being on time for my appointment
i really do love the selection here
my mommy makeover results are fabulous and im only a few weeks post op
the new front office people are terrible
some of this is par for the course but in my opinion the hospital staff is there to make you feel confident and comfortable
unethical and conniving
i had to have a tooth pulled and a graft put in for the start of an implant
dr patel and his staff are very nice and take the time to make sure that all of your questions are answered and all of your concerns are addressed
now i know why he doesnt take insurance  i cannot imagine an insurance company that would approve of this kind of dog and pony show
today i showed up at 145 i was told we wouldnt be seen because we were late for the appointment was scheduled 130 i explained that i thought the appt was 145  she proceeded to explain they only schedule on the half hourhour those appointments
peace and grace
best gym in las vegas
not only is it closer to work and home but the staff is awesome
i get my extremely expensive glasses for less than 400
if you want to bring a a couple close friends this is perfects for a girls spa day on the cheap
when we ran out and needed it to be filled she refused to write the script as she had not diagnosed the patient herself yet
cant say enough good things about dr lanre
i decided to go to a dermatologist to get my acne under control
he kiss keeps it short simple i would highly recommend him to be your ob
some of the staff would say for instance teach on a topic such as mindfulness only to read from a text
i figured i could use the credit for a cleaning so asked about a cleaning
we just relocated to las vegas and dr aikels asked us about all his previous history
dr lee and all his staff deserve an a
how many people can honestly say they had a 445 sick appointment and their doctors spent more time than necessary with them
they didnt have to do it since it was my error but it was awesome that they did
i got the 1 hr massage 1 hr facial and 30 reflexology package for 100
the technology they have in their office is above any other eye doctor ive ever visited
so even though i had to wait 35 minutes to be seen it was definitely worth it
i felt confident in his abilities and decided to go ahead with it
the staff up front were helpful  friendly
the spa is very clean and everyone was very friendly
ive been floating and flowing through my days since
i did a lot of research which i tend to do before going to any doctor which led me to this great establishment
i genuinely felt that they cared about how i was and wanted to give me the best treatment possible
management less than favorable
i had an absolutely terrible experience the practitioner refused to provide birth control because they said my blood pressure was too high
nice 8 hour forearm sleeve session
the staff asked for my license and insurance card because the guy from before never saved it in their system
not only was my facial great but she educated me on my skin problems
we have since still tried to contact this company by phone and email and have received no response
i couldnt have been more pleased with the service
i recentley had surgery at mtn
before we get to see anyone
he is all about helping and educating his patients and the comunity  in general
her comment was  i do not supply notes about our session
the doctors that i saw were ok but you get a different one every time so there is no chance of building a rapport
i was thoroughly shocked to find out when i asked
this is the best quest location i have found in las vegas very nice help ladys everything i go there
at that point it was very easy to tell that there was some sort of share on the value of the gift cards between spafinder and the merchant which is evident in why they didnt want to accept the gift cards
i have not had a migraine or seizures since
i know there is more people that are very unsatisfied but afraid to speak for some reason
would not recommend this doctor anybody
was told again that my boyfriend would receive a call back that again never came
the pricing is reasonable and their trade system is great
das mineralwasser ist einfach wunderbar und fr menschen mit empfindlicher haut super geeignet da chlorfrei
worked out thanksgiving morning and loved it
we did our 4th iui with dr severino on 12517 and i am so absolutely excited to be pregnant
but i do mostly all of my grocery shopping there because they are cheap and have a really good selection of vegetarian items
i would not trust any other place with my face
no more testing from what i can tell
i was greeted by kevin the wonderfully charming owner who is also an excellent massage therapist
i happened to have made a copy and gave them another copy
never heard back
i would have much preferred to deal with this without using social media but when i attempted i was unsuccessful
first off the bill was paid off proven with the statement from our medical credit card that it was charged from this clinic and its billing department
theyre inappropriate and rude
i sent him kind of a crazy desperate email and he replied back within hours
they are very accommodating when we have changes in our schedule
i let out a hoot so loud i even scared myself
a month or so following this appointment we received an explanation of benefits from the insurance company stating that we are responsible to pay a balance to southwest medical associates
wait time was minimal in the waiting room i actually think my appointment started early
i explained all the other mistakes they made such as embarrassing me in front of my child but she didnt apologize for that
i would also like to say a special thank you to kim for holding my hand during the procedure and ensuring me that all will be fine
and for me thats very important because if they werent so nice i probably wouldnt be so keen on going every single week
so incredibly happy to have found this doctor
after only 3 weeks of acupuncture my pain subsided from 89 to 12
i have been at it for four months and i can definitely feel the improvements
dont waste your time or money or endured unnecessary pain
when i got to the back the dental assistant took the time to get to know me and have a chat with me and even offered pandora and let me choose the station
dr neilson sat with me and explained everything clearly and he has actually been able to calm my terrible fe a rate of the dentist
well i went to my family doctor and got another ekg with no problems with the hair on my chest
this is a non biased opinion i have of my visits here
you have to hit the place at the right time to avoid the wait
i took them to and urgent care up north we care urgent care 5 stars because phoenix children s couldnt take my kids for a day
only a few times i had to see other docs in her practice but over the years i would usually wait to see her personally
again refer to the labels
the massage therapy is also very wonderful
if i could give no stars i would
love this place
you do nothing but wait and wait and wait some more then have 2 mins of their time and are pushed on
triage went fast but again there was a wait you can expect this because people tend to show up for any reason at alli recommend an urgent care for the smaller things if your urgent care is still open at that timeusually urgent cares are open until 8 or 9 at nightand those who expect it to be like the tv show just have no common senseif you have the time to yelp and wait in an er then maybe its not an emergency
she asked relevant questions took charge and stated her course of action
finally i had to call my insurance company yesterday to register a formal complaint against dr burke and her staff and asked to have a new primary care doctor assigned so i can have my needs attended to
each crown is perfect in terms of margins gum line fit spacing shape color and flawless in every cosmetic detail
very disappointing and i can only assume their physicians dont trust insurance companies
so it can get a little pricey when you first start treatment but i find it well worth the cost
how she didnt know this baffled me
seriously i am a baby and it didnt hurt at all which let me tell you it has previously
thanks much for everything ladies
the nurse took my vitals and then the doctor saw me shortly thereafter
i feel awesome after my sessions and always look forward to my next one
instead i turned around and went back to the car do not go
went to him for a 2nd opinion on a dubious diagnosis and he was so great downtoearth and very helpful
there isnt much about your heart he doesnt know about
please dont hesitate to enlist his help because you will not regret it
every time i come in the wait is at least 30 min the longest was an hour and 15 min
however my experience today calls for one
i had to take both my kids in within a week of each otherwith the same symptoms
christine is fantastic
i was greet immediately upon entering and checked in
i couldnt stop staring at the spider webs and dust bunnies
tried numerous times to schedule and first of all was difficult to just get an answer on the phone
i saw dr heller two times for a toe nail issue and both times he was very pleasant and understanding of my fears of needles and pain
if you have anything beyond a cold the flu strep throat and the like dont waste your time go straight to the emergency room fastmed is a waste
the receptionist answer who never knows what the heck is going on and tells me oh ya we have your results no one called you
the price was the same as most any other dentist
and there are a few
my menses were painful and not regular
it got harder to get anyone to call you back
he spent 2 and 12 hours there and 130 dollars for nothing
it was as if there were no notes in my chart at all explaining the procedure that was completed
his staff is always friendly and professional
i had a horrible experience with a local neurosurgeon and dr mahajan offered to take me on as a patient
he then walked me back for an exam  which consisted of checking my reflexes and checking my blood pressure
i will never return or recommend this clinic again
and we soaked for a bit as they massaged our heads and necks
i am so impressed
weve also talked about making better food choices
i will send my coworkers family and friends here confidently
they were always so professional and caring
they are all very gentle and sweet with my baby patient and informative with me and theyve found that happy medium between making me feel welcome to ask questions and addressing my concerns versus having an efficient appointment
my step daughter purchased a gift certificate as a christmas gift for me and when i called to schedule an appointment to use it i asked if they would still honor it because it said it expired 6 months after purchase date bought 1262015 tried to use 08222016 she said she couldnt honor it and to call the manager the next day
i was surprised as i had ringworm a number of years ago
i cant really comment on the eye section of the office because i have only been there for sinus treatment
if you have not tried acupuncture give dr zhang a try
whatever i was kinda weirded out but it was a splendid surprise she def worked out my back knots
dr lac is very professional and does a great job
they were willing to help get my medications covered with a prior auth and were helpful in helping with another prescription that was a better price cash pay than my regular copay
i was patient and they had three chances to correctly produce my glasses and they could not get the job done
went on a monday evening
jessica is highly educated and does a great job explaining the procedure and what are realistic expectations from the treatments
he just got up and walked away
and like hal johnson and joanne mcleod would say keep fit and have fun
ive also done p90x blah blah blah and the boot camp classes challenge me in ways i havent been challenged before
theres no attempt to sell you useless services and proceduresthese people really seem to care that you get what you need
u gotta get here
go go go
my insurance had lapsed after i was laid off and i was stuck needing a doctor with no insurance
i visited this gym on a business trip from los angeles
at the end of the day i have a small kid thats not feeling well and iwe depend on our medical professionals to aid us as parents in giving quality of services to make our babies feel better
hence i had to use up an extra visit insurance limits to 2 per yr on another contact check up elsewhere
however if youre looking for good results with attentive masseuses who can pin point your pain areas and make you feel like a million bucks you should go to toronto bodyworks
my only complaint is that he wont renew prescriptions for a long enough period so i have to come back to the office more often than i would prefer
ive been seeing jodi arnott for about two years for treatment for various issues and have been really happy with the outcome
the food is fantastic
bring your kids here too
that was a relief to me to be able to take my time making my choice without any pressure
during the surgery appointment she went over everything that was going to happen during the procedure and what to expect afterward
basically i wasnt be opened up or put under general anesthesia
ive been to the apothecary shoppe and i always have a great experience from the knowledgeable employees to the inviting environment love this place
she is great
but now that they got me sick i will never return
i had an rmt massage and pedicure
then he has the nerve to post videos of his encounters with law enforcement and of course he was acting like a total douche
she does the more gentle form of adjustment which doesnt feel like much at the time but wow is it effective
some of the targets ive been to have a starbucks but this one doesnt
the care i have received from him has been great
he took the time to get to know me and made me feel very comfortable
there are tvs in every room
when i told suzanne this she very rudely started interrogating me on what i was looking for and how uncommon it was to make this sort of request
they dont accept credit cards like most dispensaries but they have an atm so dont worry
i would recommend you try a class and join if you love it
absolutely love this place
while cutting my hair lauren continued to ask me if i was ok with the length and also explained what she was doing
the nurses were very positive helpful and always with a smile on their face
i highly suggest if interested in getting laser hair removal done this is the place to go
dr benjamin is a miracle worker
of course i yelped it and found this place
he answered some of them but i noticed  every time i asked something about natural ways he stayed silent
the day after my procedure i asked to go back on active status again
i loved it
he even recommended her getting filler below her eyes and we had read that when a doc suggests that run
the front desk staff is always helpful over the phone and upon arrival  departure
having never received chiropractic care i was extremely nervous about the whole neck cracking thing
after the surgery dr mozayeni personally called me to make sure everything was okay like i said all class
after getting several recommendations from friends for dr rojas i decided to schedule an appointment for an issue i had been experiencing
im thinking that this may not be a wholly accurate statement
finally we got to the grand canyon
the second time i was sick and got no exam and a prescription for antibiotics and decongestant
its clean front desk lady is nice
i just felt like i didnt have her attention
then i happened upon kathi mansell
got real help
good luck with that
also every optometrist covers this test
afterwards i discussed my budget and monthly payment plans with their financial department
as i was done with all that i felt relieved that it was all over  going to shop for eye glasses is not my thing but then sam told me there was a sale on prescription sunglasses
i felt rushed unheard and most importantly i didnt feel as if she cared
i had to get my sealant drilled out and get my tooth filled
i found central phoenix eye care thru our vision insurance website and then the reviews on yelp
she took her time with my dad
the guy called his manager and his manager told him not off tbe entire purchase
lol its was some good awesome butt kicking boot camp style workouts
im literally counting down the days until my next appointment
i was a potential new patient and had been referred to a doctor ashley cole
my insurance company will be called next to dispute unnecessary billing for ridiculous tests
i heard patients and family members constantly in distress because no one would show up after they used the alarm to call for a nurse
we have already referred one friend to blossom and anybody out there looking to let your birth shine like it should go blossom
i see dr crutchfield and he has always been amazingly attentive to my needs
back to my reviewwhen they called to get payment i was informed from now on we have to give them our credit card information and allow them to keep it on file from now on
i tried validating several information by asking specific events that took place in the past
i got the deep tissue massage
well maybe because it wasnt there
some of the office staff and nice but some of the younger ones have an attitude problem
i love everything about this place
we did this on a whim and im so glad we did
i called their office
i have been here several times in the past and was not impressed however i had to return a couple of weeks ago and i have to say they have improved
this star either needs to go to yelp or this business
also i had my card charged twice 50 dls instead of 2495 when i called i spoke with juan and was told to dispute it with my bank and he cant do anything about it
we took my daughter to dr johnson to have her wisdom teeth removed a few months ago
patients time is valuable
the dentist and admin staff were happy to oblige my rather unusual request for a certificate of dental health needed by an empoyer even though this is not something they normally do
i was not impressed as they didnt do anything for me
3000 for xrays cleaning and exam
my appointment was with dr suzanna fox  she is wonderful
it was too bad that ownership has been changed
for instance my wife and i both have silhouettes  michael kors oga jaguar nike sunglasses theory sunglasses and other high end frames
i definitely recommend this office
only used this place for haircuts but the person who i have found to cut my hair here does a great job
i didnt even know there was a gnc in this plaza until i drove in
i was so scared because of the sedation and the work to be done
the professional manner that every employee gave was just so great
i have had to wait at times but i understand that she is dealing with babies and unexpected deliveries
awesome professional family owned business
when i arrive early for my appointment the receptionist says it doesnt matter i have to fill out the paperwork again
i was handed the tv remote and settled into comfort for 30 minutes while my teeth were whitened
they really need to google the baldridge framework so they can learn how to treat the customer
i moved to charlotte a few months ago and trying to find a stylist in a new city was not a task i was looking forward to
he has awful bedside manner and generally a bitter disposition overall
and i couldnt believe it
i havent had the best experiences there but whenever i go it looks like theyre understaffed by at least 12 people
most pediatricians warm the babys heel so it doesnt hurt as bad but these guys didnt
i could not believe that someone would walk in there and only clean that part up
e  this was timely as getting ahold of my son at school is tough due to restricted use of cells at school
its usually over in about 30min and im always amazed at how little pain i feel compared to waxing
wow was it accurate
ashley maintained professionalism and brought a calmness to our experience
went to get my lower back checked out and it took roughly an hour and half to get someone to check me out
oh yeah  most importantly my son never had pain never swelled up and had no post surgery problems
i feel like ive been con buy the hospital
it was just nice to know she actually cared
this office could not find one
i started going to in touch wellness sometime in october of 2015 for sciatic relief
once again none of her damn business and extremely rude
the staff even the doctors  who spoke with this man who  obviously did not need to be  driving  did not intervene  or call aps  to assist him and help get him home or the police
it worked finefor a month
if you are reading this you know how stressful dealing with infertility can be
both were thorough and carefully done
i highly recommend one medical group as well as dr khalsa
i am 2020 in both eyes 4 days after surgery
feeling nice and relaxed now and will most likely get a membership
however after two extremely rude encounters with employees at the front desk and at the glassescontacts counter my perspective has changed
and let me tell you i feel better then ever
they give you this sweet note with a chocolate to put you at ease
that tooth now has a root canal and im no longer in pain
i am a dental work coward and they are so kind to me
dr walsh also contacted me the next day to make sure i wasnt having any issues with my crown
the office staff is friendly too
youd think at least one person from corporate would care enough about this place to either step in and intervene or do the community a favor and burn it to the ground
the moment i made the first phone call i knew i was in great hands
my teeth are kind of a mess and i was honestly embarrassed about being seen
ive never had a bad experience with this office
i go to the other animal hospital and they looked at shadow and said they were pretty certain it was just a dry bite since swelling and effects were so minimal we left him there overnight and by the next morning almost all of the swelling was gone
on our first visit when my kids were sick dr jacque was rude to my daughter and told her to stop talking to me when she trying to ask  me if she could lay down on the table
knowledgable friendly staff and minimal wait time
even though i had been a patient for 3 years i was asked to fill out new patient paperwork
hed never not shown up before
they also gave an option to purchase a dvd of the entire ultrasound set to music
i followed dr farrimond here from his last location and i couldnt be happier
for any of you that use groupon you know your treatment and reception can be hit or miss since you are getting an amazing discount with the hope that you will be a regular customer
cant wait for my next massage
the one place i would expect thorough cleanliness is the examination rooms
first place i have gone to that hasnt tried to get me to take steroid injections
mine were bigger and they were framing my face whereas the one in the photo had smaller curls with them curled away from the face
place is extremely clean and feels welcoming
however i could neither sit up nor walk
the staff was also super friendly
even better he works with doterra essential oils which i love
they all were so sympathetic yet professional listened and addressed all my concerns and needs
shout out to my hair stylist brigitte whose professional advice and talent never fail to leave me with great hair
my daughter found this place for me and man i tell you from the time i stepped into the building i felt at ease
this office stinks
the floating pod has just the right amount of water in it and at a comfortable temperature
i had to pee and an appointment to make
going back and forth with an individual in the office has got to be the worst experience i have ever had with any doctors office
he actually had a nurse brandi tell him why are you moving around so much it cant hurt that bad can you believe that
he loves his job and is always up to date on the latest and greatest
i got there an hour early and they then told me we tried to call you to let you know your time and about your insurance
very very nice staff everyone was super nice to us nurses doctors even the security guys
this place is a rip off and their program manager theresa is worse than a used car salesman
had lots of fun with my friends
everything felt awkward
the massage therapists are also very good and the idea of getting a massage before the adjustment is a great approach
i have been coming here for several years and really enjoy it
my tat didnt scab with him or anything
i went in for my check up the next day and my vision was almost 2015 better than 2020
dr johnston came in and was great
i called in to tell them about it and the guy on the phone was rude and unhelpful
i have been to a few different chiropractors in my life and dr teddy sim is one of the best
she is emotionally unstable find somewhere else to go
honestly i think i built more upper body strength here than weight lifting
other than that i did appreciate the online appointments and getting in and out of there in an hour
pain on the left had subsided a bit so they thought it would go away and didnt test it
we chose unfortunately to do this at mercy gilbert as it was closest to us
i asked to speak to the office manager and was told she wasnt there  are you serious
with no hesitation i would recommend dr hong and his team
my sister in nc was surprised when the uc doc gave me an antiviral and antibiotic at the same time and i told her its standard whenever i get sick due to my symptoms medical history and where i work
health is high priority though
they do not push you to keep coming back
i brought this to melanies attention and that is when the excuses started
i cant recommend her enough
i asked to see a different physician but he was refused medical treatment due to their office politics
they are always able to get me in when my kids are sick with minimal wait time
my doctor was very knowledgeable and helped me choose the right program for me
not a lot of mips there
i went to friendly dental as a new patient on monday december 19 2016 i wanted an exam and i knew i had cavities that needed to be filled
if you have options exercise them before submitting yourselves or child to this place
can i also mention that he has a great sense of humor
i will agree with every single review as far as the receptionist is concerned
they were professional personable and made me feel comfortable
seriously dont waste your time at a big chain store
thank you sarah for your help
shes a diabetic so we also talked about the changes in vision due to her blood sugars being highlow
urgent care knows nothing
thank you gvfsee you for the next baby
ive been to other cheaper spas that do facials and i always fall asleep during it
btw when they brought the chair they kicked it into the room and yelled theres your chair
this is not the place to go if you want to be rushed in and out
the staff bethreceptionist and amy dental hygienist are very professional and welcoming as is dr blazer
that they use are nicer looking than several alternatives ive seen out therea noteworthy aspect when youre referring to teenage clientelle
first off she talks us into doing 90 mins instead of 60 mins then only does 75 mins  wants to argue about how long it was
i never thought id say thisbest dental experience ever
i considered my start day to be the day after loading since in my opinion eating like a pig for two days did not constitute a new diet change
i have met a lot of wonderful people all striving for the same goal making this one of the most comfortable places for me to be in
dr goodhew introduced me to the clinics chiropractor dr sohil shafiei dc
25 hours after my scheduled appointment time
so how does that help me to choose a doctor at the location i was at and she said that it really didnt
thanks to jahna my vision is completely clear again and i tossed out the prescription orders for eyeglasses
they are like family to me
none of the above can be undone
i walked right in got seen within 10 minutes and left with meds in less than 30 minutes
it made me far more comfortable than i have been before
people are friendly but most importantly the massages are always great
there is nothing better than getting your orthodontic needs taken care of by a team that has amazing communication skills the latest orthodontic technology and genuinely care for their patients
they tell you exactly what you need and how often to get it
no one showed up
our initial visit wasnt set as planned since we requested for us to be in a couples room but they placed us in separate rooms
he consulted with me first and nailed the pressure
they seem uninterested and unprofessional
hey ladies he might even heckle you about why your boyfriend hasnt proposed after forever
the office staff here is also great
i bought a package of facials and booked months in advance but they would constantly call and cancel right before and then i would have to wait weeks for my next one
well hopefully this is a front office problem not a dr carolyn pace problem
i also love the new health portal where we can review our summaries test results etc
sara brown stylist  extension specialist she gave me the best summer highlights fresh hair style  extensions to add length and thickness
they will give you many choices when managing your dental plan
i have been to almost every dermatologist in the phoenix metro area i have had  great skin my whole life and randomly at 25 i got a pretty moderate case of acne
they were gracious to give me a discount on the frames that my insurance did not cover
the procedure wasnt painful even though i had taken a long break from it although i will say ive never really found the procedure that painful any time i received it so that doesnt say much
the office staff is wonderfully friendly greets you with a smile
i was quoted 3 so i called early this week and asked them to find out why its taking so long
i love the staff at this office from the front desk to the hygenist to dr adibfar
i had never gotten a thai massage so didnt really know what to expect
surgeon brilliant nursing staff very good food appalling and generally inedible and cleanliness very good
ms tiffany and her staff are doing everything right here
he just grinned and said yep
myself and my fiance went last night and we both enjoyed ourselves
skip to a couple months of no phone call i call them and they tell my that my insurance did approve my mirena but i would have to pay 800 dollars up front for it and they would pay me back once my mirena was put in
i feel like dr kessler really is looking out for my best interests and overall eye health
ive just recently started going to this office a few months ago since my insurance changed
the problems werent over though  after requesting that they send my records three times they have so far sent the wrong records twice and sent nothing the third time
heed your fellow yelpers warnings unlike me
from the exam to the frames everything was fast fun and fashionable
he wanted to do an inoffice procedure at a later date
very clean office and the front desk girl was very very nice and helpful
there was dust on everything that i looked at so not much cleaning goes into the detail of the office
anyway her assistant called me back today about the blood work
so we walked quite a ways to get xrays done there to find out that they dont actually give you slides
i was in a wheelchair at this point and in a lot of pain feeling very awkward about where i was supposed to go or how to get there
plus the hospital was clean and nice
they should have those calls on a softer ring
i highly recommend dr greenberg to everyone that i know
keep in mind i didnt receive anything but an exam and a pair of trials
the front office staff is less then desirable
it is so nice to go to my appointments here
dr gilo is one stop shop
i definitely would and have recommended scnm to my family and friends
dont you hate medical professionals who talk as if they are the end all
i really appreciate how dr herro anna and michelle always tell the patient what they are doing as the next step in a procedure
i suggest anyone contemplating using edgepark not to
her billing department seems to have a problem interpreting eobs not her patients
they have no sympathy
all in all did not feel the services received had a value of 189 despite paying a little less via coupon around 150 total and yet it still wasnt worth it
thank you for making a difference in my daily life
appointment they took upon themselves to reschedule because the doctor i saw two weeks ago chose not to stay with the practice
ive had several crowns redone here as well as bridge work and multiple cavities ranging from small to very large
wait for their sales where you can buy a gift cert for 15 less than normal
has excellent bedside mannervery professional
i want to give cpec 5 stars due to their customer service
when i call to confirm they cant find the appointment but they do find one that is coincidentally exactly a month from now on 318 at 4pm
dont send reminders about appointments being a busy mum you can forget
not bad wait time if you dont come in rush hour times always come here for a simple birth control prescription which never takes me longer than 30min in a good day
if you go there make sure you read everything before you sign it
my husband and i were visiting vegas for a short weekend and we decided we wanted to get some form of a massage but didnt want to pay strip prices
2 months later and banner refuses to seriously discuss the over billing issue
worst experience ever
i let jessica know that i had gone over what procedures he performed during our consultation and that there was no reason for the confusion
those 2 processes take probably about 1 hour
i moved here a little over a year ago and wanted to find the best dentist in all of the cleveland area
i had to have surgery to sew them all back together
dont even bother going here if you want to  spare your tooth had a dental bridge treatment here spending like 25k and in spite of spending that kind of money and with all the assurance from the dentist the bridge is no longer in place
this mgr believe her name is angela is a twat
it didnt just make this st up and i dont appreciate being talked to like im an idiot
ive been here many times over the past several years as well
i would suggest avoiding this place entirely the dmv provides a better customer service experience
please heed my warning
ask questions about everything
like do they not know how to check on their patients
i highly recommend centennial dermatology
the entire time he was pushing and prodding my face and being extremely invasive
i have a history of sinus infections have had septoplasty to correct my deviated septum and have moderate asthma
dont have to buy another package listen to the radio they usually have specials
once we send it over to collections we cant help you there
he had a kind and upbeat manner
speaking from both a personal and professional opinion paul is the best pt in the state of arizona
512 saw feng and i told him what had happened
this fiefdom of medicine is probably the only reason cleveland hasnt been completely left for dead
needless to say i walked out
she was friendly quick and informative
i made a phone call and was shocked by how rude and unprofessional the receptionist was
the gentleman who answered the phone was abrupt and clearly in a rush
minus 5 star for an awkward moment when he was trying to lift my cami upwards to massage my back
after our son experienced a bad slip and fall at mcdonalds while getting off their playground we needed to rush him to the closest er due to a laceration on his lip and almost pushing twisting his front three teeth back
this business is not honest in their billing and youll pay for it literally
the whole process was so easy
went in for a lab before my next appointment and they lost my paperwork again
he owes us a cortisone shot supposedly 2 for 600 but since he didnt write it on the receipt he now refuses to acknowledge that he owes us one
our baby looks exactly as he did in the 4d pictures and the experience was great
after receiving my portion of the bill this week im already on their automatic call list to pay the bill
my ex husband and i did some preliminary testing with our 10yr old son at attention center
i love skin oasis med spai have been going here since they opened
our ultrasound tech victoria was amazing
the front office staff is very friendly and the dental assistants and the hygienists are the best
i didnt have a current insurance card in the car so she pulled it up on her phone and gave it to the other party and the police who actually showed up eventually
his one office staff member is loud and obnoxious
first round went okay but the second time i started to feel the sensitivity
i found the attention was great and the staff were very friendly
he was great at not only the exam but at helping me try to wean off of an expensive dry eye med
the only cons are youll occasionally hear a fellow massagee snoring yes they are that good and the fact that they dont provide insurance receipts
front office help is excellent
with trying to decide who to see as my podiatrist i came across dr natchers website liked what i had read and decided to make an appointment
i have been coming to this office for over 5 years now as well as bringing my children in
thank you victoria
i guarantee you will love him as much as i do
they do not over book themselves its fantastic
thank you to the staff and doctors
every item is vegetarian and they use veggie meat from morning star
frher waren wir regelmssig in den schwabenquellen  die zeit ist vorbei
the office is new clean and well organized
went to the ultherapy event with my mom and had a blast
then 3 months later i get a call from a debt collector
seems that he forgot to inter me in the system
i have never had a hygienist who was so excessive in dental care
i suspect these are issues affecting the company overall but the inability of floor staff to help close the loop on botched deliveries for purchased appliances quickly is aggravating
afterwards my face looked a little gross but i mean after 3 days itll heal and she also told me about using apple cider vinegar as a toner and i definitely recommend
she works for dr kristen rojas  is the best
nurse w2 injectable pain medswants me to pick a side while preparing 1of 2 syringes
dr gasser has performed this procedure more than any single practitioner in arizona
while part of my treatment was to include strength training to build strength in the muscles surrounding the injury and while the clinic is equipped with free weights and machines not once in all my treatments did i undergo any strength training
many specialties are covered here including cancer treatments same day surgeries lab work imaging of all types doctor visits etc
my advice
maybe was just the therapists off day
the actual surgery is done at the scottsdale location
they allowed me to contemplate about this dramatic decision for as long as i needed to and finally allowed myself to have faith in dr hankins and bambi
she has super strong hands which is great for a massage
i may give this office a second try but im still debating it
youll be glad you did
her diet ideas are really life changing
that unfortunately is where the praise ends
secondly the shower we had to use before going into the tub was lukewarm at best
she takes the utmost care in providing us with the proper exams and products we need
i must give 5 stars both to the pearl
if you have insurance through the market place avoid at all costs
i highly recommend this practice if youre a busy working mom like me
or 3500 dollar bills
at least 100000 in co pays and more  for serums
very nice atmosphere by all
i was never to happy about this other doctor  office was outdated and kinda grimy staff was mediocre however its convenient and i figured easy to get an appointment as a patient of record
but they should know that trevor is a real asset to their team
i had to crawl back on my own
i signed in and filled out  the required paperwork
i ended up stumbling across good reviews of dr mchale plus her being a woman and younger made it the perfect combination
its the day after the root canal and i still have not taken any of the medication prescribed for pain because i have none and cant really tell that there is any swelling
the staff is very nice and the office manager was great
they were willing to work with an insurance complication and fit me in on a full day for an emergency broken tooth
the school nurse said she had lice so we went here to make sure
the patients were being laughed it
in scottsdale where there is a new med spa around every corner i shouldnt have to work this hard to get a flipping facial
dr jones and his staff are great people
we explained all of his symptoms how high his fever was the coughing dizziness chills etc
so if you go there be prepared to wait and waitwhen my old co worker told me she quit we celebrated lol
go see dr batoon
linda  is the epitome of excellent customer service and works to make sure you love your results
my fear of the dentist has caused me a lifetime of procrastination issues but dr g puts me at ease and has for last 10 years or so that ive been a patient
cant wait to see the finished results
they make you feel comfortable and at ease
amazing experience from day 1
again i got a voicemail prompt
also the doctor just simply reccomended some over the counter things which i felt was safer than prescription drugs
i found that they are innetwork to delta dental so i called them up and made an appointment
he takes great care of his staff and their happiness in their workplace shows as they interact with his patients
and ive seen dr maltais for beauty treatments
for the most part the pros outweigh the cons by a lot and thus a 4 star rating from me
i really feel like i wasted an hour of my life
4  they deliver
it will be better when stm finishes the tunnel from the vendome metro stop
very happy with my experience
my insurance covers 40 cost of frame but when i want to get the frame they are only willing to give 20 off because i didnt get the lenses with the frame apparently so i didnt get the frame
they have reached out to me from arizona vision trying to make the situation right
highly recommend them
every appointment i have here takes forever
i was skeptical at first but i can really see a difference
one word t h e r a p y
dr julie is like the dentist whisperer for my son
i will be a customer for may years to come
my bf is new to this clinic so he had to fill a form and then another patient came and he was new too
i look in the mirrori do not like the bandaid look but whatcha gonna do
my only problem was the wait
so i trusted her but i was still skeptical about it
my mom was happy with her care so that makes me more comfortable with the facility
i returned again yesterday based on desperate need to fix chips on front teeth
i called to cancel it and the receptionist ill never see again didnt bother to ask why i will not be a smile today patient in the future
and i was as well once i started seeing dr martin
well from that one experience if i werent so mature i would have flipped in that office
dr duran was great and very through
they were not even deep enough yet to warrant intervention certainly not special deep cleanings every 3 months
i wont leave the practice for anything
somehow i am not surprised this chiropractor was put on 3 years probation by the chiropractic physicians board of nevada in 2015
one finger is already almost gone
i have been studying metaphysical subjects for like twenty years nownearly half of my adult life
thanks everyone for fitting me in so quickly and taking care of my needs the way they needed to be taken care of
i always leave satisfied and pleased at their attention to customers service details
and dr chaffin will not return my call
the tech kept grinding the dentures trying to get the bite right
unfortunately dr glasser is no longer with siena but we stayed and started to see dr mehri also very sweet
if you are on the fence at all about seeing a chiropractor just go in a talk to dr chris he honestly just wants to help people feel better
i am not amused
i have recommended him to my associates at work
ive only been once but so far she is a hell of a lot better then my last doctor and actually listens to what i have to say
i do plan to make a formal complaint and would suggust not going to this facility
that is when i walked out
the dr is extremely easy and comforting to talk to
if they didnt sell me enough with his service and knowledge the staff is friendly efficient professional and remembers me every time i come in
as we were leaving another nurse asked why are we leaving
each eye literally only takes minutes to do
but sure leaves a sting when theyve already come to your bedside to collect payment for them
wish i had found her years ago
it means a lot when a dr really genuinely thinks about what your saying and helps you and is honest and just doesnt  tell you something to shut you up
she has helped me and i have referred to many times
im not sure if they are avoiding a lengthy correction procedure or if they are scared of retaliation
who closes on a friday at 4pm
i personally enjoy the summer stock playhouse last summer was comprised of several recent mfa students of color from chicago and the plethora of free events
during check out i was not pressured into rebooking or signing up for a monthly plan
i have never had a long wait for an appointment although my kids dont mind because the games and ice cream machine keep them busy and happy
so i thanked her and left
before performing any services he first does a full consult with you to find out what results you are looking to accomplish and then gives you feedback on how he feels would be the best and most cost effective way to achieve the results you are looking for from his services
dr bruce really listens to you when you are telling him whats going on
comparing to my usual spot which i now appreciate
horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time the lenses are much higher quality and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that arent ugly and durability
better to have an amazing doctor and poor office than vice versa
all i know is that ive met my deductible according to my insurance company so i called valley perinatal back
i had ke who also has very soothing and strong hands
its very pricey and only guarantees 80 success rate this office offers a deal for half off the 2nd procedure but i am extremely hesitant to invest more money into it if it didnt work at all the first time
and asked the same questions the front desk staff asked and the medical assistant
what a delight
i regretfully will be looking for a different dentist
dr meline put me at ease with the procedure i will be having and i have full confidence in him
i had to find a new dentist quickly because id broken what i thought was a tooth and my insurance had changed
well i came in and the nurse could not treat me that day
they make the normally awkward bikini laser funny and not awkward at all
as if the staff in their office here werent rude and unhelpful enough this collections guy is the worlds biggest a
they have great team of doctors theyre very professional they treat you really well you got a great bedside manner
i was visiting from out of town for memorial day weekend did not have an appointment yet they still squeezed me in on a super busy saturday afternoon and took care of me as if i was a regular customer
i have to say the last massage that i received i wouldnt even consider a massage
dont get me wrong good pain is good but bad pain that makes you stop breathing during a massage is no good
but the best part is how much time they spend with you its not just 5 minutes and an rx
i needed to get a td vaccine for the grad program and it took them almost 2 hours to tell me that theyll need to do it on a different day because there are other patients waiting
but class schedule is super nice and plenty of variety
he recognizes symptom and correctly diagnoses every time and on even very little information
it is a waste of 20 a month
will never go back here again
you either loved both or hated both
the facility is very clean and the sell a bunch of awesome baby and mommy items in their store
i was herded through their system of pretending to take care of you when really theyre just stalling
dr rumison did a great job
i had set it specifically because of my days off
if you have more staff like her who genuinely care for people your hospital has hope
she acts like your a bother and is very condescending
there were already some people in the waiting area but by the time i checked in and was called inside it wasnt so bad the process was quick
one told me she didnt care that i wanted to avoid drugs and intervention and told me there was no point in considering it
dont do it
everyone is so friendly
staff is great they answer most questions before you ask and the product is second to none
now i just want to help others avoid my misery
i hope that no one has to go through what i haved had to but at least if they do this place is very a good at what they do
im not just another number at his clinic
the office staff and assistants were just as pleasant and it was an overall great decision
i couldnt remember ever going there without waiting in the lobby for at least 5 to 10 mins sometimes more
the staff at morrison vein truly care for their patients
i have never found another person besides my spouse or parents that cares more about my health and well being than dr tafreshi
i would highly recommend heather for any service
we have been to a number of dentists in las vegas and are extremely happy to have found island dental
everyone is super nice and always remembers your name and what is happening in your life
update  it has been several months since dr blanton finished realigning my spine
anyway for the next two weeks i used the machine and while it technically worked i noticed that my milk supply was getting lower and lower
i will be back and i cant wait
i figured i had gotten it wrong and just went to grab a coffee
i have been trapping feral cats and bringing them to paws for neutering
they are always on schedule and your appointment time is your appointment time
i like that those types of procedures are last resorts
i  love this place for lots of reasons super friendly people bright  cheerful surroundings knowledgeable on products and procedures clean  it smells good
in the evening of 2262016 my asthma advanced to the point where i could not breathe i took 3 puffs of my rescue inhaler and then a liquid breathing treatment at home
i found it on the internet in five minutes the night before
i will say i have a holistic bias so i was much more open to the idea of using acupuncture as an alternative than some others might be
oh and not to mention the 500  1200 hospital bills weve had to pay because this doctor rushed thru his surgery
i am sure he was trying to show off for his young attractive assistant
he gave it to me and i left
the best dentist surgery i been to
it sucks that this app tells you the wrong time
im not even finished with my contact lens follow ups and im ok with writing the whole place off
we had just barely started to go through their overwhelming gel color selection when the gentleman said youre seats are ready right over here
id suggest any potentially new patients consider him only as a last resort
they answered all my questions and were really happy to do it
a few visits later and i was back to normal
well just got my credit statement for june good news no new charges but no 80 dollar credit
although i liked him i will not return to this office
they always try and squeeze you in and accommodate your schedule
how should i word this
dr mitchell combines adjustments with massage and physical therapy
this places laser is much less painful and more precise
knowledgeable efficient easy to find location no issues with parking
while i was there a woman was very upset she wanted to private pay and not use insurance which isnt policy
i was leaving for vacation in 3 weeks so she told me shed order me extra since i was going out of the country just in case something happened and i needed back ups
she adressed everything to the t she did not rush the appointment at all and made me feel super comfortable
she takes time to talk to you and i find her a bit eccentric in a good way
i appreciate that the menu is changed weekly as i tire of the same old meals week after week
i been to this place 2 times
there are other dishes that i am eager to try so i will be back
the first time i had a deep cleaning that included fluoride and varnishing
the first few years went by and everything was great
i said that my appointment was with dr romine and she said i was scheduled with a different dr  this must be their normal procedure because the same thing happened to my friend there a few weeks ago
instead he spent over 5 minutes of that time dismissing my serious issue and accusing me of thinking i was special for asking for two things
at least for now i can save my money and i go twice a month instead of just once a month with another doctor
he proceeded to do a root canal on the tooth
i typically have bought my frames from target and the like and have spent less money i bought 100 frames today but the quality is noticeably better
i was in severe pain for two weeks
always clean and organized this location is also in a great spot for shopping and eating
i am now about 3 weeks into my treatment at ignite
both he and jess practice what they preach and while i may be tired as heck when im done i know that means ive done the work ive needed to do
and went back to our prior dentist  listed in the phoenix magazines top docs  only to find that no work was necessary or even recommended
i went in for a physical and it was all conducted in a timely and professional manor
such a great studio in downtown mesa
felt like someone was just spraying my mouth with a water pic
fortunately for me those classes are a 10 drop in making it more realistic for my schedule and wallet to incorporate a once or twice a week class into my routine
my appointment was at 7pm and i arrived at 643pm
i cant stand doctors and nurses who love to throw around medical terminology and expect you to know what they are talking about
only complaint was with such huge waiting rooms it was super noisy and lots of people seemed sick coughing spewing snotting etc
one of the nurses said theyre not going to give you anything
most importantly dr parsanko is an excellent and honest dentist
or maybe i misunderstood
the wait is way faster than the summerlin office way busier at summerlin
ive been to many massage spots around the east valley and decided to give this a try since i have been having horrible aches and pains
dr matt mitchell and his excellent staff have had my dental business ever since i arrived in the valley eight years ago
there should be more people like him
well he is definitely yelp worthy
the whole office itself makes you feel welcomed when you enter
i would definitely recommend them to a friend
dr hahn was very unattentive she would not listen to me while i was speaking she spoke over me constantly
after paying a 25 dollar copay and having to pay our 20 of what is left over we were charged 75 300 billed for only 3 minutes of actual doctor time
this was my first cpr class ever and was impressed by how thorough the instructor was
this is one of the coolest decisions ive made from august 14th until session 2 which was october 2nd i shaved my underarms for 2 weeks
the receptionistguy in the front did not say any of this when we entered and though i asked for a couples massage i was under the impression that we keep our clothes on because it was one of those chinese reflexology massages in a chairmat
designer labels galore
i had to point this out to the doctor to get it correctly revised
convenient communication through text i ordered the couples massage
as they are rolling me out dr goodhead threw scrubs at my sons father and said if you want to be with her hurry up
all of my tense spots are gone and i finally feel relaxed
i called my pd and they are shocked and say they never said that and my son has no cavities according to their charts
they charged us 70  said we were wrong then refused to change
i would definitely go again and would recommend it to others
i cannot say enough great things about them
i asked if i wanted to wait on that procedure until i do more research and get a second opinion can i just take care of my little spider veins now
i go 5 days a week and even though im sweating and working out crazy hard i feel great
ive always been one to hate going to the dentist but since coming here i always look forward to it
after 3 sessions i didnt notice any improvement in my pain and felt that it has gotten worse and told woo this
i dont recommend this outfit because frankly they are too busy to practice medical awareness and professional expediency upon yourmedical concerns or conditions
they are kind patient and gentle
my daughter who is 16 needed major dental work in order to fix decaying and broken front teeth
jon and his wife are such sweet people and jons expertise is fantastic
it wasnt relaxing at all
obviously im going here for a not so fun procedure but he made it as gentle as possible
what the hell for
you guys didnt do anything and you lied to me when i called and asked about the test
after i filled out my intake form i was browning the wristlets they had to offer in the lobby and i was told i could pick one out as a free gift
they asked if i could wait an additional 30 minutes so they could do it now
all went well and it was time for sleep
heres the bad part
i went back to my conference and gave others the information on that spa if anyone had time for a massage before they left town
they have a wide selection of quality and trendy frames not the kinds that feel like toy glasses that you can find at walmart or costco
i loved it
its has been two weeks and they have not reviewed some lab culture i had taken because i am in serious pain and they have not given me any medication for it
tried it out and wont be back they advertise 49 introductory offer and then tell you oricing changed in september
really approaches your issues specifically and individually its tailored to your paindiscomforts
having said that their prices were very reasonable
im sorry but it isnt the patients job to educate your office staff on how to do their job
become an expert on reading labels and youll save a lot of money
yesterday i was working in the garden and as usual my glasses were not staying on my face
she was really patient and answered all my questions
its now been over two days and i have only gotten worst i cant barely eat it hurts so bad to swallow
the doctors at preferred rehab listened to my issue and took the time i needed to thoroughly assess my needs
this is normally a 15 charge but since my experience  has not been great they gave it to me free
i must deal with floaters on a nearconstant basis much more than before the surgery
on our first visit with dr cheney she made us both feel comfortable and we absolutely love her sense of humor and compassion
my hubby became very frustrated stepped in when realizing that they were just  trying to get money off of us
the vendors are more geared towards hair and aestheticians
doc came in asked some questions gave me some paperwork and send me on my way
i wont be back ever
overallthey are a great group of people
after training for 4 months here ive cut my body fat in half and added a ton of muscle
he was super nice his staff is super nice
inept accounting self serving charities and less than optimum treatment overshadow some good staff
only 1 time we waited more than i was comfortable with in the waiting room to be called back to a room about 30 min
why rush me if youre going to call me back during my original appointment time
i am looking down just trying to stay calm
after the hell of the outfits that treat you like a car on an assembly line never seeing the same dentist twice i gave up
the equipment is up to date and state of the art
i recommend making an appointment for your first visit
however i told him multiple times that someone at front desk confirmed with me that i was tested positive for cannot publicly disclose
not only is dr suba amazing but his nurse practitioner staff and the whole mental health alliance building is amazing
my hair just seems to fall into place naturally
this place only has 2 stars for a reason
i will never step foot in this mans office again
she also made comments to me about my skin which i felt were rude
my frame of reference ive been lifting weights and doing cardio for 12 years at various gyms across canada
when the dr called me with the results a week later he was very aloof and different
however he made crude comments like when i die i wont fit in my coffin and my pall bearers will get back injuries and finally that i have more skin than he and his assistant put together
i will be speaking with fedex my new employer about finding a new place to do these drug test
i paid for another 3 sessions upfront bringing the total cost of my groupon and additional sessions to just over 700 for 6 sessions total
lisa is a breastfeeding guru
the nurse was also great with my son
we always felt at ease around the doctor almost as if talking to a good friend who really seemed to care about us and our baby
rest assured that your oral health comes first not money
ive never experienced anyone in a doctors office who goes more out of her way to help
staffs very unprofessional
i feel like myself again and i owe him a huge debt of gratitude
i was then escorted by a hygienist that appeared to not want to be there
went for my first ever eye exam
i highly recommend this nail spa to anyone
i was on the phone with him he called me to ask if a deep cleaning was normal and i literally heard the hygienist tell him he had no choice but to get one
they seem to mirror his attitude of treatment like family
well i think after 6 years of stretching that it would be better not the case
best dentist ive been to in all my time
so i can pay another office visit fee
shes just extremely knowledgeable about massage therapy and the body in general which i think is key
never mind the fact that the coupon was dated that day
their phone number doesnt work and have not been contacted despite my multiple attempts at contacting them via their webform
massage was actually not bad but the fact that the lay had the nerve to say sorry minimum tip is 10 was mind boggling
the building and furniture are old
i am not all that surprised by this crap anymore
the worse massage i have ever had
the next day my cousin come in from miami and i took her there for a foot and shampoo massage once again we had a great experience
i did not pick or pop at these but for some reason when they would finally go away they left an ugly red mark
i had my csection done with vwfw and was having cramping and bleeding for months
dr kerr is someone who always listens and her care has enabled me to find 2 cancers in early stage to the point where only surgery was required
i dont know how you run a business this way
but the people working there are awesome
these are genuine positive and compassionate people
her work speaks for itself
i think that nevada health coop was never billed by them
i ended up getting the retinal imaging which is well worth it just to make sure my eyes are healthy
the office is more like a home not a cold place but with all the newest equipment
he made me and my family feel safe and calm
i couldnt believe i was even in a doctors office
she found a wonderful new home at no lines by design
thats my take
in my book it is absolutely unacceptable to accuse customers of having fake gift cards or accusing them of lying about having credit at the place
that is an amazing deal
i wanted lipo on my arms  inner thighs outer thighs and a front thigh lift
i checked out with my free toothpaste and tooth brush
my favorite part was the bill for 900
i went down to the starbucks area to get a coffee and when standing in line 3 er rns were behind me one was telling the other two about a patient whom she named stinking up the hallway all night and thank god they finally got stinky as she called him by name a room
the best part is that on certain days of the week the daily hours of operation vary there are lunch time appointments and i can come and get poked during the stressful work day
i will never see anyone else
she cares about her customers health  wellness as well as her staff
forget being proactive and trying to manage your health
i went in with my daughter to try and find frames for our new prescriptions
my masseuse was diana and she was great in finding and rubbing on the areas that felt tight
very unprofessional and frustrating id suggest looking elsewhere if you expect professionalism or accountability from a healthcare provider
i was beyond impressed especially with the consistent followup
greg was real ass hole to us we were next in line he help someone instead of us sears hiring more people instead of seating on there ass
of course some doctors are better than others but when we need an appointment at the last minute we always get in the same day
its hard to find a good dentist and glad i found them
the dr is so caring knowledgeable and really takes the time to get to know you beyond just your medical needs
there is the bikram way and no other way
turns out their office was 2min from our condo
well for the most part every appointment has gone good and fairly timely
if you want to see the dr for something different example you hurt your neck or you found a lump on your skin you must pay for a second appt
i need supplies for chronic respiratory issues and heard there was a new company which actually takes care of customers and doesnt treat you like an inconvienence
works like a charm
worst medical facility ever
the front desk staff is okay but admittedly they can be a tad unfriendly at times totally understandable since it seems to be fairly busy most of the time
got there right at opening
this is a long delayed review but i had out my experiences in the back of my mind until we met a strange character dr saul from ad at a yelp event earlier this month
the people at the front desk are always very polite and helpful
the whole team does a great job of adding that personal touch
booked the special 2013 victory 10 with my credit card online
research the reviews left by patients and former staff before choosing this place
once i got to the back it took me 40 minutes to be seen
she had a seizure and wasnt doing so well after so the hospital wanted to get her into rehabilitation
great place to get your back and neck looked at and adjusted
all in all a very enjoyable experience and will go back when its time to fill my other prescription
what insurance wont cover my other drs just bill me for its never more than 20
i was transform into a baby who was being swaddled
im 3 months post surgery and it was more amazing than i imagined
no person should have to go through this
the next day my shoe fit again
this is not how you treat veterans or do business
janelle is amazing
cost of course is always a concern as these usually run 2535 at most locations
after surgeries and then a car accident i have been a bit beaten up and a massage by sawana was exactly what i needed
next time auc first
i wasnt given much in the way of instructions by the owc staff member
i highly recommend him to all looking to get the best treatment in the city
this place is a book nerds heaven
if you have an ongoing prescription that needs to get fulfilled for your pet then road runner can be a good alternate to more expensive pharmacies
however my midwife stayed with me my entire transfer ensuring that i was in the right hands at the hospital and that i felt supported
i feel as though i was being hustled and am not satisfied with the results
dr cory then informed me that my son  had croup
i almost forgot
im hooked and so glad i took the chance to try ilovekickboxing and found my new workout home
i will refer anyone who has been in pain to go to anthea
i never dread going to therapy because its always a good time
i do not recommend going to this clinic
and he gave me a cleaning cloth without charging too
all in all if youre a regular gym goer its good value for money  especially if you get some sort of discounted membership
upon exiting i looked at my billing quote for the services and a mouth guard would cost me 1000 by itself
she  knows how to treat my skin and i normally get excellent results
1st stay i was here for 15 months placed in the coed general psych unit
dr carlow did wonders for my fiances back
the office staff are genuine and welcoming
she was fantastic
there are coat hangers comfortable armchairs and massive windows allowing for an abundance of natural light to flood the reception area
i really could have waited until breakfast the next day
cant wait until i have enough money to splurge and get them done more often
the staff were all very nice
when i asked the receptionist was rude and claimed they never received a request
however the staff at this clinic were caringauthentic and spent time with me
she gave me a few different answers a she said she was using novalash glue because i mentioned i found her via novalash and that glue is much slower to dry compared to what she normally uses
4 doctor spent about 10 minutes with me for a complicated medical condition  offered no help
first let me say the every physician that my wife has seen here is amazing
as the other reviewers already said he takes care of the patients himself asking for any symptom pain or sensitivity cheking the teeth explaining whats the status and everything
the nail tech told me it was an extra charge because of my coffin shaped nails
she really made our experience a very enjoyable
the first visit was ok and for the money i would not complain at all
i felt extremely at ease throughout the entire exam and i felt like it was important to her that i understood exactly what she was doing why she was doing it and why it was important
he did something very bad to two people i know
she had terrible bedside manner and suggested my problems would probably just disappear in time
we are still waiting 2 hours later and no one cares
so i made a last minute reservation on valentines day and the receptionist was very pleasant and eager to book my appointment
two stars because the office was clean and the visit was fast but alltogether not too pleased and would never recommend this office
so many er docs are rude and the staff could care less about your time  not this place
dr bonsettveal is awesome
you wont be disappointed
i asked if they could change it but they refused
i rushed over thinking the worst only to to wait for 4 hours in the waiting room
the gym is simple but has everything you need for crossfit
dr kinkead does a great job with very personalized attention
i would definitely recommend coming here
he was taken upstairs only to find that the room promised hours ago had not even been cleaned from the last person
i had originally come in for an estimate but the process was so long and tiresome that i decided it was worth it for me to just buy them here
unfortunately im transient due to my profession
i had many options but had been told by a friend that this place was nice
seek and ye shall findi was seeking a different path for my soul mate and i found jeffhe is very gifted empathetic and kind and a master at his craft
it was awful the pressure even after saying something was painful
after my exam they helped me out with my contacts and made sure that i was comfortable putting them in and taking them out
will be a regular customer from now onwards
i related the story to this person and said i wasnt going to wait that long
it has given me more energy and helped me with my weight loss goals and staying fit
i really like dr markham and his staff here
the referring friend described dr amols mantra as changing the phoenix infertility scene and we were skeptical until we met dramols in person
their scheduling is so convenient
i have added a picture but it also was not working  imagine that they serve a pizza in a vending machine that actually cooks itself and comes out smoking hot
the waitress was friendly she provided recommendations and she joked around with us
they cant read a thermometer correctly  a digital readout
i went to eva and she is amazing
he takes time to listen to your problem
i was able to take the best course of action for my skin and the results are incredible
thank you shepherd eye center
he is extremely professional courteous and personable
expect super friendly timely honest staff  service
so for those people who say the md are uncompassionate and no bed side manner they are the ones that seem to bee seeking narcotics the easy way
she didnt ask until half way through if i was pregnant or not i also asked for a full set of xrays since i hadnt had them in several years
his staff is happy and friendly
after my surgery i wasnt in any pain at all and the nurses and staff took great care of me
the kick is that it was signed by dr kanelos who never even had talked to me or approached me about anything
the staff really set themselves up for a win in my book
needless to say this is the eyecare office we will be coming back to as long as we live in matthews and if when our kids eventually need glasses as well
amazing eye care center
i wouldnt go to any other doctor but this location specifically is always running behind
its a tad too hot for me but not a huge issue
go check it
they always remember me and are very friendly
they couldnt figure out what was wrong so i was admitted
everything was explained very clearly as far as insurance coverage
she is the best i had some complications during delivery she was great explained everything thoroughly
i told her my prescriptions didnt match and she said contact prescriptions were usually different because they sit closer on your eye
i do a lot of repurposing and the leather skirts i have found have yielded some gorgeous purses
this has a wonderful staff they were very nice and courteous
i love this and totally respect it
during the placement of the bands and the other items needed for my adjustment it felt like somebody had a pair of pliers ripping out my teeth
soon as i walked in i knew i was in the right placestaff was very nice and helpful looking forward to more visit would recommend everyone to check this please if you looking for a greart dentist
the hot and warm oil and stone melting my muscles my entire body so relax
my masseuse took a while to get to me and was confused about how to move hot water out he kept looking at the watch and he would do the same massage strokes over and over and over and over again
we dont really lift anything over 30lbs
i felt re energized after
i know they get you on the little things like 5 here 25 there i myself declined almost all the little extras but i did upgrade myself from the cherish package to the ignite simply cause i wanted my wedding to be in the wedding suite
i mean if my child is sick today im pretty sure shell still be sick tomorrow
dr petrick and staff are all truly caring and devoted to the highest standards of care and human relations
i was skeptical at first to come here because of the reviews but i was pleased with my visit there
staff was very friendly and they move quickly to get all their patients taken care of
im now a regular and would recommend her to absolutely anyone
seriously where did you get that number
now heres the thing about living in a small town good luck finding a dentist thats open on a weekend
my insurance company does not print new cards each year and since my card had last years printed date on it i was almost refused service by the person at the front desk
i have been to other chiropractors prior and will not let anyone but dr cheree touch my neck
great service from cameron
i went for a 90 minute massage and it was the best massage ive had in years
a big thank you to everyone at gvfp
good for big heads like mine
even if you only had a cleaning he wants to make sure you are ok that to me is incredible patient care
i was throwing up blood 30 minutes after being discharged
this is my second visit to this location i definitely will be back
she responded by threatening to sue me if i contacted her or wrote things about her again
he is very caring and will go out of his way to help you
chase is truly results oriented and i felt very encouraged during each work out
he was condescending when i asked him questions like could i have sibo like my sister was treated for and told me i had should probably have a colonoscopy as my colonoscopy 3 years ago was murky
they take xrays and say that its broken
he is very experienced and explains everything he does very well
she was very kind and thoughtful and took lots of time to answer my questions
the labs blood people  were surprisingly good too and im a hard stick
these people really are great
if not there are dozens of training centers around town
lets see i get my teeth cleaned twice a year and it is the best job and price i have ever had as far as dentistry goes
the office is very clean and rooms are equipped with the latest machines and technology
i felt very comfortable in her hands
and being able to use the steam room in the change room afterwards was awesome
i wanted to like this placei really did
we were to have a treatment done with insurance but when we were finally able to come in for the procedure we were told we had to pay for it which didnt make sense they said they ran out of time to bill for the cap that was created but it took them quite a while to make that cap
they truly care about you here
not bad experience had a dollar laying there from going to a vending machine and they assumed i was snorting my meds they searched but didnt find anything and that was it most of the nurses were great but a few of them just have crapy bedside manner the er doc knew exactly what was wrong within like 30 min so that was cool not a bad stay just happy to be home and feeling better
i enjoyed the ambiance and it was fairly quiet
i filled out my forms and gave it to him
sure enough my scar is now flat white kind of looks like a small stretch mark and not itchy
thanks dr chen
secondly why would you after realizing this had happened be waiting and seething and prepared to scold me when i walk in
i told him i was having trouble hearing out of my left ear now idk why that would be funny but apparently it was because the gentleman at the other computer burst into laughing then looked at the guy who asked me what i was in for and he then started to giggle
very professional and friendly
the nurses and technicians are very friendly and i liked them very much
i have driven past this building dozens of times and just never had time to really study it a bit more closely until today
i was even given a nice little care package to take home
i went to see him today because i have a bad cold and i know the adjustments will boost my immune system to help me get over this bad bug in vegas this year and i will feel better
i just want to say that i had the very best experience at the oculist today
the staff are very professional and give great massages
i came here in need of a pedicure during my vacation
us consumers pay dearly for our health insurance
bottom linei can breathe again
stopped in this past saturday to get some vitaminsa daily multivitamin and fish oil to be exactand for the exact same brand we usually get on amazon the prices were better  cheaper
the rooms arent rooms theyre really cubicled off so you get the privacy but you can hear everything going on around you
i emailed craig and asked if there was anything he could do
so i call again and they put me through to the doctors office
waiting room was comfortable
learning how to roll over to taking steps eating more verbalizing utilizing his hands and sitting on his own
i just should remember not to make an appointment in december
completely the worst of the worst hospital ive ever been to
she actually began crying during it
i had to have 4 teeth pulled due to overcrowding and i had absolutely zero faith that those huge gaps were going to close
the location is behind umc hospital and its on the third floor
i left the office in a hurry already calling my work apologizing for being so late
a longer wait than expected with only one person before me
the staff is friendly and helpful
great staff and service
she takes her time with each patientparents etc
been here a few times and keep going back each time i need new prescription sunglasses and glasses
i recommend this to all the mothers not only wanting to find out the gender of the baby and those who wants to have an idea how their baby looks like
some time in the night my garage door spring broke and in the morning we found our car trapped in the garage
the dr told me what i wanted to hear and it was quick and seamless
i was done with everything including writing paperwork and getting my prescription papers handed out to me in less than an hour on a saturday
he is a nice person just not a good doctor
i want you to know you have an exceptional team at dr simoncellis chiropractic ctr
the exam is quick and more questionanswers
beware  if you want to risk having someone steal all of your personal information as well as have doctors that dont actually listen to you then this is the perfect office for you
finally after a long road of trying so many chiropractors over the years i can honestly recommend  dr rose to anyone that is seeking to truly get better  no matter if its your back or just wanting optimum health
i felt as if he was very prejudice and degrading to us
the two doctors i dealt with were both so kind and again put me at ease  not sure if two docs is the norm but the first wanted to check with the one in charge that day to make sure
i have been seeing him throughout my pregnancy and has really helped my back pain
after selecting everything i need ive always been given an estimate of 710 days until pickup ive always been able to pick up my items in 56 days
he came back and informed us it was a kidney stone
i couldnt possibly be more pleased
their price packages are overly priced and dont let me start on all the paperwork you have to sign
she is caring and has created a very zen space
really worth checking this place out
they are thieves milking the system
i dont feel like she ever forces add on services that i have encountered at other acupuncture centers
oh and ive now had 3 lactation consultants  an ot tell me my daughter has a poor latch resulting in insufficient milk transfer
we get back in the room i lay down and he is in the same position
when my mother asked what was happening no one knew what to say
i was on time for my mri at 245 pm
doctor trevor answered all my nervous annoying questions and walked me through the entire procedure
but we decided to stay
each time its a two week scheduling wait
their real genius tho is the super team they have been able to pull together
we really love this team
i was seen within 15 minutes of my appointment time on both occasions thats nuts and had no problems with paperwork or copay transactions
just like another reviewer stated i too was very impressed with minoli upon first meeting him
she said it was up to me then looked at me very disapprovingly and said its your health
carpal tunnel and we need to operate tomorrow
she also got goodies in the end that my daughter was happy with
it was clean and well managed
overall this was perhaps my most positive dental experience in my entire life
i have used the zoom whitening laser at the dentist and i feel the whiten up laser was more comfortable due to less heat transferred to my teeth
i needed to have my coach sunglasses tweaked and went to see if they could help
it was really annoying because i went from being completely relaxed to wanting to go over there and tell them to stop being rude
i was surprised at the willingness of the doctors office to let me try more than one pair without being pushy about selling me overpriced contacts
it was a big insult and i will never go to this shop anymore
with a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the ymcas in charlotte this gym is the best bang for your buck
i was the one requesting this service as i wanted better water for my family
i liked dr wlodek and his eye exams so i came back once i got vision insurance again
i walked over to the counter to get some help and well they were all busy
michael is incredible
i think my classmates and i were disappointed that is why non of us graduated or have a certificate
from the time i entered i was immediately comfortable
this is so unprofessional and made me feel like maybe they dont care at all
shannon has helped me get back on track personally and professionally
you guys might want to fix the wait times or have your staff not book back to back do you really expect people that are in constant pain to sit almost 2 hours in your waiting room
so she hads me a mirror when shes all done and im orange
for anyone that can count that is 20 on the dot
i needed a check up to make sure i was still healthy
loud and clear with no questions in my mind there were our options and possibilities
you have to come visit dr gore
i am so disappointed in the level of care my son received at this pediatric office
very weird to see this
this review is for banner desert medicals education center which was great
my mother stroke was processed on a friday night
wont go anywhere else
a friend of mines was referred here for his chronic back pain
this place is terrible
will highly recommend to family and friends
im a college student and during the summer i stay in phoenix and decided to try this local yoga place
my journey isnt over but its much easier now that i know im in good hands
whatever i have  dentist so lets just fix it right
additionally they only seem to allow you to book appointments online
did not feel valued as a patient and grew exasperated by the end of the appointment
i would not recommend them for any durable medical equipment
however i had a big filling drop out of my wisdom tooth and had to be seen and they got me in the same day however dr durisek was not available and i saw another dentist after xrays and an exam i was told that the wisdom tooth could not be saved and i would have to go to an oral surgeon
i really appreciated the whole staff and will definitely go back to them in the future if i want to have anymore procedures done
highly skilled respectful friendly and so very competitively priced
he leaves and a staff person comes in and shoves a notification of financial responsibility form in my face to sign
i was newly married young and naive
i cant recommend this place highly enough
we have medical insurance so i figured i pay for insurance and the cost could be covered by this
i usually see morgan
theres a variety of treatments available not just full body cryo
he did a great job
if you need any testing done steer clear of this location and go to literally any other one in the valley with more competent staff members
the front office staff was not very friendly and did not acknowledge you when you walked in
although i pray i am done with surgeries since this has been my 6th joint replacement i am happy to know i have finally found my forever physical therapy clinic if needbe
what more can you ask for in a pediatrician a office
woke up no pain mouth felt great
at the same time i got excellent care and a lot of useful patient education so i dont want to take off a star for that
as i said before i love dr adams and i credit her with saving my my life but some where along the line this went all wrong
i started my treatment when i lived around 15 minutes away but ive moved twice and my commute has evolved to a 60 mile drive round trip
great selection of glasses that are quick to have filled
2 hospital systems fell short
he took one look at my lower legs and said it was a bad case of cellulitis and a strong antibiotic would knock it right out
dr oyesiji a arojojoye  is very kind patient and understanding
he takes time to listen to me and really tries to understand what i am telling him about my medical condition
my therapist was sensitive to my individual requests as far as area of focus and level of pressure
aside from waiting to long to start the procedure after numbing the area neither the pa or her assistant seemed to be very knowledgeable about my situation
the staff here are super friendly and helpful
take my advice and seek treatment elsewhere
whats worse is this is after i told her i havent been to a doctor in 10 years
i never received the email from them
the manager and the technician needs to take course on customer service
i waited another 20 minutes
sticker on the front door when people clearly do not
she must have finally retired because there is a set of new cashiers manning the store
it dont mind going back to get my contacts corrected however dr nikki has consistently blamed the dry weather or allergies for the contacts not fitting comfortably  for the last 2 years she has given me eye drops to go home with in which i am to use for a week and than continue use of my contacts
it seems there was a little bit of a balance of like 15 from one of my visits
the instructors are awesome i always learn something new and improve my practice with every class
this place was amazing
i have had a lot of imaging done over the years and have always liked simonmed and it is great to have all of my images at one place due to memory issues im getting to old to remember it all
they all greet you once you walk in
i spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing
we will never go to anyone else for our aesthetic needs  love you sarah
my wife was feeling better within hours
he was required to attend cd classes when he was there for what they thought was bipolar
i called the day before to make an appointment and they came the next morning and ran a drip with vitamins in it and a half hour later i felt incredible
i will miss them all
if you want to sweat they have a class for that you want meditation they have a class for that
if i could give dr stock and his staff 10 stars i would
have been taking our sons 3 and 1 to siena peds since birth
he fixed me
i left my puppy with a feeling that yes everything will be alright
kirk will cut you offunfriend you and all
i had andrea and my gf had noah
i was fortunate to find dr struble when relocating in the valley
you must be very openminded when visiting this place
he is very knowledgeable and he has an outstanding bedside manner
she has a nurse practitioner barb and shes awesome too
im new to foot problems and this is the store my dr recommend i visit
the final straw was when i went to refill a prescription
the manager is never around and they do nothing to correct their wrong doings
when i checked in the technician couldnt find the code dr ferdowsians office had put on the paperwork so she called
one of the kitchen guys brought me hot chocolate every morning i got spoiled
colleen was exceptionally patient with each of us as we sifted through the myriad of frames they had to offer us
every staff member there knows exaclty how to make you feel welcome and comfortable
i am always treated very nicely and its got a great peaceful vibe
phoenix tattoo removal uses the pico sure laser
paige office scheduler said sure we take his hmo plan
plus they always end up charging my insurance so much
so i received a miss call the next morning and called back and was directed to the office manager nicole w and she started going off that our intentions are wrong and how we refused to pay 1600 for the visit when all we did was clarify how much would a wellness visit be and that we are not going to jeoperdize their practice and how we are trying to trick them to sign a document and end up being liable if anything happens and that here goes you cannot get away with this in this country and i was in shock when being attacked that way and how she had witnesses on the trouble we did at the doctors office the day before and she has witnesses i was appalled because this was all false my sister has been seeing the the last 3 years  and how they made that judgement call surpised us
as you can see this place has 2 stars
we came in to get a massage in a sunday night
great first experience here
highly recommended for anyone wanting to lose weight that is affordable
he screamed at this person colleague
when i arrived i encountered a dentists office like none id seen before the place is like a spa
i have never had a doctor like her
everyone here is really nice and helpful
i have come to the conclusion that its only worth my time to go to specialists bc all other drs never know what the heck is going on if its not in the say 10 top things people go to the dr for
contacted groupon and they said there is no such thing as groupon tax top up
totally unethical practice for any business let alone a hospital
davis is an amazing dentist
its ok but if you have a choice id go to summerlin or another less ghetto hospital
that was the worst hospital ever
discount dispatch didnt appear to care
the only reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 is that almost every time i go there is only 1 person working in the back room even though there are 3 counters
the full amount would be 16000
i myself will be going to a new practice where they appreciate their customers and dont just prescribe on just a patients verbally telling them their symptoms
beware of security camera in private massage rooms what privacy
they offer court sports trx training personal training body assessment and fitness and nutrition coaching
visit was pleasant and pretty straight forward
i have worn glasses since i was 8 years old and honey let me tell you these babies aint getting any better
unfortunately however i am not reviewing her but the office as a whole
clear cosmetic clinic is very clean and private
whatever the mix up was it has been resolved and i have been assigned a nurse coordinator who thankfully does not make use of an answering machine
go away nationwide vision
i love going there because it is warm and comforting clean and calming
i only wish this guy was in florida where i live
i have mostly been treated by dr donna and dr tolley
i dont go to this store often mostly because i find it too big and the pharmacy is about as far away from the front door as possible
second we werent there as trainers we were there as potential clients
i consider the wellness program an investment in my health and its worth every penny
their office impeccably clean and they accommodate to your childs every need
i had to come back for one other visit to put the porcelain crown on and finish my other 2 fillings and youd never know i had any work done by looking at my smile
i told him i dont need to go to an emergency room all i really need is just an xray
i went somewhere else to get my lenses prescription filled
cant wait to go back
im compelled to share my experience with sage hospice
this place is disgusting i would not take my dog back to this place
but overall i like d service
personally this small change is very noticeable when i look in a mirror and i am completely satisfied
dr kwok is always willing to give as much time as needed to complete the exam
healing for the body mind and spirit
if you have those aches and pains the infrared sauna is amazing
dr gonzalez has a very gentle manner about him and describes procedures to his patients in a language that is nonthreatning and easy to understand
waited for over a hour and  a half just to see the nurse practitioner who was only in here for 5 minutes tops
almost no wait time
i have been seeing dr goldansky for many years
its so important to stay on schedule and you can always get a hold of someone if it is nearing the evening
office staff asked for information said they would call back and never did
where should i start location location location
when i went there and i met her i immediately could feel how sincere she was and i felt comfortable opening up to her and explaining what was going on
just to clarify i have no pain sensitivity  or bleeding and yet they tell me ive got 9 cavities and gingivitis
what stood out about this place and warranted the 5 stars was the dr on duty
it really seems to help relax my mind which is exactly what im looking for in a slow flow or deep stretch class
i finally threw a dig when she was getting discharged about her never getting water and the nurse brought her some in as we were about to walk out of the room
and if you need their services please please call them
and the facial was only soso if you do go ask for kathleen shes the best and i wish i had insisted on getting her again the gal this time wasnt great and seemed exhausted
i was a bit skeptical after reading the other reviews but my experience was nothing like the others at all
thats a rare thing these days
needed to get my gel polished removed late night before returning to the office tomorrow morning
solves problems for moms
i love adel and james blunt but not to work out to
the worse office to deal with
still waiting to feel better after 7 weeks
i wish i had listened to my husband and switched doctors ealier
she talks calmly and explains every movement to him as she does it
i work in medicine  know shit happens so i went in there not really bothered but when i walked to the front desk and said hi the receptionist made an annoyed face and kept typing for another 10 seconds before asking what i needed
the company needed docs approval but was declined because i didnt go through the check up process that i wasnt notified about to make sure the contacts suited me
family focused eyecare takes the hassle out of getting your eyes checked and has a good selection of frames and sunglasses for adults and kids
but i do agree that the front offices of many medical establishments detracts from the medical professionalism of the enterprise
i was very happy with dr la tourette and his staff
they always tried  to bill for procedures they knew my insurance wouldnt cover over and over again
i appreciated his honesty and not overcharging me to fix it
saying my product doesnt look right is a natural thing but i feel like it shouldnt and just asking for an exchange
i was there for my nt and nb screening because im high risk this is my rainbow baby
he just continued to act like he knew what was happening when he clearly had no clue
i have yet to find a dedicated massage therapist here mostly due to my random scheduling habit
actually the technicial was very nice
i chose the electronic exam and was actually able to see a picture of my retinas
my mother is undergoing surgery today and everything was fine until they started asking me questions about previous dates and appointments that i had no idea about
dr ellis and his staff were consistently patient and attentive to my pain
they helped us to plan a perfect day
they put out their groupon around the octnov months so watch out for it if you are interested
bought a 2 month trial from groupon and was urged to get a monthly membership
shes amazing and has the newest technology  shes sweet
the doctors were  friendly and full of knowledge
he takes the time to listen figure out whats causing the problem and then recommends a personalized plan to help reach your goals
after about thirty minutes i asked her my status and she gave me a thumbs up so i was pleased that id be seen
dr dipietro explained what my options were for treatment and how i could expect the finger to heal
with other vets they have been very distressed but at pet health they are so much calmer
also if you cancel you will lose all your credits so use them before you cancel
the office has an exclusive feel to it
theyre honest helpful to the point and trustworthy  exactly what i want out of any doctor
now when i call they wont speak to me but have the nerve to send me emails trying to sell me more work
dr campbell has done his best to help me control my pain but as most people in pain truly know nothing can get rid of 100 of your pain
they took their time to explain the services required and options available
guarantee theyll stop paying by may just as the holidays of november through january  pay to their trackers get out of wack because there are so many people playing
made an appointment and walked right in without a wait
definitely a good place to go
the ambulance took her here wouldnt let me come with them
the next morning my allergies had completely vanished im not sure if this is iv related but after days of suffering im attributing it to my drip
love these guys
we always make appointment with henry or annie
nobody talked to me or let me know what was going on like sorry for the wait she will be with you shortly or something
even though i hate these things there are other times when things are more smooth
a regular teeth cleaning turned into a huge hassle
i work out alot and easily get knots thoughout my back and shoulders
i was 1 day shy of 10 weeks pregnant all the appt consisted of was paperwork and a few questions about my health with the pa at 10 weeks they do the pelvic exam and meet with the dr instead of the pa so i was one day shy had to pay my copay and had to make a second appt for the actual exam seemed like a waste of time
turned out that she had a mistake and it is pending payment from the insurance
dr yoza and his staff are really personable and go out of their way to make going to the dentist a positive experience
perhaps also mention how confusing it is to find their clinic in the shopping mall and that they turn people away who are 7 minutes late would also be helpful
i have seen a few of the doctors and 1 of the pas
ill be driving to phx childrens hospital which is 35mins away next time we have an emergency
now that i am about to start my career as an rn i wanted to go to a store that had a wide selection of scrubs
the staff was wonderful
i love target but i dont like this particular store as much as the one near my home on blue diamond rd
i really like this facility
first of all edna who started my iv and got me checked in and set up the morning of my surgery was great
side note i forgot my apple watch and they ran out of the building to bring it to me
she seemed embarrassed by his lack of concern for his patients
first if i could rate dr olsen separately i absolutely would give him 5 stars he is a fantastic eye doctor friendly and thorough
though i did receive ample time with dr during my visit
i recommend him to anyone that needs a neurologist
i always have less back pain as a result
alexis was my massage therapist and was great
she was pushing the most expensive plan instead of reviewing my case and asking questions about me specifically
dr hammond is professional and friendly
they are taking great care of my fur baby and there was no one here in the valley i would trust to do so
called about adult heavy disposable diapers and was told they had total dry in stock
i was pleasantly surprised when i came into the store  i was greeted my carman she was pleasant knowledgeable and proceeded to get my super feet insoles
it was extremely obvious how peaceful the office was and everything ran smoothly
my review and experience is consistent with julia g  this dentist is a scam do not go here
dr bradshaw and his staff are top notch
she ended up shaving too much off of one side of my crown and the hygienist said i hope you dont get food stuck in there and that was it
my wife has the fear of dental work dontophobia dentophobia dentist phobia and dental anxiety but who thinks it is a great time
this office is going down hill
it was awful
but i was also concerned
oh and a estimated bill for 32300
btw i have a 5 star uber rating  a 48 lyft rating my riders love me  i love them from seeing these horrible driver reviews i thought i could do the company good but obviously they are control freaks that just want to be rude
i am very very happy with my results and my hair looks really natural and nice
the office staff is pleasant  and professional
he cares deeply for his patients well being and although i am still in the healing process i am very comfortable that he will do whatever it takes to ensure a beautiful final outcome
we spent a good amount of time loosening up my muscles in order to have an effective adjustment
on our first visit dr dani checked out my son and all was well
i seriously cant think of one thing i would improve
we both received the deep tissue massage
from the greeting to the exam procedure and financial aspects of it all this office is hands down the best dentist office ive ever visited and ill never go anywhere else
luckily for him im not that sensitive
nyeree is so great at what she does
shes honest funny smart  talented
i love this place
it is a disgrace
i stood up pulled up the website to show her that what i printed matches exactly what i gave them but she continued to tell me that im wrong
i did not like this
she is so passionate about making a difference in peoples lives that i knew this would be a great experience and it was
i had a 60 minutes session which turned out just as i had wanted
this month it was a ticket to enter a raffle drawing for a one year lease for a new dodge dart
i asked if i could schedule an appointment to confirm my pregnancy before i start my new job since it would not be easy for me to ask for time off with my new job and her receptionist said no the doctor wont even see you until you are at least 8 weeks
dr blume is a master at his craft and his team is friendly and helpful
i will never come back
dr v spends time to explain things to me before we do anything
the first time she spayed it she asked me if i felt anything
this place is incredible
loved his sense of humor loved his thorough explanation of the xrays i provided
no matter how many times i asked them to come down and see her they couldnt be bother to stop by until after 9 pm
she should know better than to threaten a kid with a trip to the hospital and ive never heard of having to lay down for a strep test
from day one they complained about everything
i consulted with dr farnworth in the emergency room after a serious facial injury
i was so relaxed and look forward to returning very soon
i have been waiting for 2 hours to be seen
my experienced going here to actually have a second opinion check up for my baby girls illness was very good
all on my upper teeth where i have no pain
dont be scared by the parking lot the facilities are cleana bit away from the stripbut for the price would return
i would recommend dr suffoletta to everyone living in the las vegas area
dont be fooled by the name its a head to toe massage that wont disappoint
only see some optometrist
the staff is friendly and helpful
there are dentists and there are some that claim to be
very helpful and accommodating staff that put your needs first
he had a receipt and very professional and i didnt even have to leave my home
the office is empty and after that patient walks out another patient goes on
never have a problem and look forward to going
should have given more weight to the yelp reviews before i made an appointment here but my son goes to the pediatric center in the same building and they are always fantastic so i thought i would try horizon for adults i walked out after waiting 45 minutes at 30 minutes i checked in with the front desk as to why the wait and they assured me i would be called back next they just needed a room to open up
dr will is great
you lost more than you gained
i was told i did not have an upcoming appointment ie they gave me a handwritten appointment card but never scheduled the appointment into the computer
ive had another root canal and crown done over 15 yrs ago with another dentist and not once have i had a problem
goes to show they stand behind their productservice
they will likely try and sell you expensive dental services you do not need
i received a letter in the mail warning that they were going to send me to collections
because they take blood herealright i am a regular donor at united blood services
maam exams is by far the best experience i have ever had
the technicianfacial technician sarah  her hands are anointed i tell you
you really should figure out scheduling so you can keep some of your patients
ive had 2 surgeries in my feet and spinal surgeryi went to dr kuruvilla for a 3rd foot surgery
abusers and idiots have ruined things for the people who work and actually need assistance
then either dr kim himself or the other practitioner forgot her name will cut into your skin with a teeny weeny scalpel and then they use a sort of vacuum to pull out the skin tag from the roots im guessing and then they cauterize or burn your tiny hole thats left behind
i love the doctors however im not a fan of their staff
i saw her grinning to herself
my kids have also seen dr rubenzik and she is professional and kind and great with the kids
i sat in the waiting room until 615  i would be prepared to wait but i think the same goes for any doctors office generally especially urgent care
at check out they offer free samples fantastic
please disavow all reviews from before july of 2015 for a fair judgement of this doctors office
i ordered their chashu kome miso ramen and you can tell they really took their time to prepare it
they are open monday through friday from 8 am to 430 pm
my girls did not fuss about it
i cant thank them enough for helping us out during this difficult transition
the prices are great
id say this was one of my best experiences at a dentist
the yelp reviews confirmed what i had hoped  a  the office is super close my house
he tried to get me to get these contacts that he let me sample and after 2 days of wearing them yes i took them out at night my eyes were killing me
also her staff is amazing
and location conveniently located in the heart of yorkville
researched for a year before i decided to make the trek from montana to scottsdale to take the comprehensive course
i will miss the valet parking and their super friendly parking attendants at salisbury though
dr sullivan has been my primary doc for years
the waiting room is a bit small but comfortable
if you judge your md
i will 100 be back
another pride authorized service provider charged me 35 for checking the batteries and said they were badwrong
on top of that it was the same crown that doc phan had advise me to get it redone at year end 2011 because there is a small gap that will cause problem in the long run
weve been here since sept 2013 with a family member and we were blown away with all the attention and dedication that the staff puts into their patients
it wasnt until 1130pm that the technician came in to fix the problem
and for the first time in the two years weve ordered this medication they sent us an information sheet with instructions and side effects wed never been made aware of before
very professional and friendly
i didnt see the amazing chairside manner that others saw
finally not a major issue  really not sure if they dont have them but i did wonder if they had spanishspeaking staff at the clinic
at first she was stoic but if you communicate with her she is very polite understanding and receptive
the practice sets up a portal for you which makes the communication easy and efficient
if you have ever experienced a hot stone massage this is similar
i went to him for bad lower back pain and he took to time to diagnose what was causing it poor posture and sitting all day
they did an ekg and back to waiting room
i feal so much better
meistens muss nichts bestellt werden
my bf was going to get charged 13000 for some dental work across the street
i used the justice center for their 100 substance abuse evaluation
i really felt that jessica listened the problems i was having and made a treatment plan that would work for me
no wait at all
i would highly recommend avoiding this business
i have neck and back pains from work
i love that they have price ranges for concentrates and flowers
so shame to dignity health for allowing a hospital to operate in this manner
makes no sense
with this came more demand
ive been back here multiple times and each time was a pretty long wait
she didnt even say bye or whatever bs as consolation for waiting for so long
the massage tables are a very relaxing way to end the office visit
i drove the long drive on that thursday and they were closed again from unexpected staffing shortage
if you need a place for your parents go and see karen shell take care of everything
its a shame im viewed as unimportant
all of my concerns were listened to and addressed during my appointments and so much time and effort was put into each of my visits
same thing happened to my husband the pa didnt listen to him or answer questions
it is a little dark though i still like the edge feeling to it brings more of the modern ambiance together
dr hangalay is the most professional dentist ive met here in phoenix and ive been to 3
dr higbee has tended to all of my visits and can honestly say that he is not knowledgeable on any of my conditions
does that border on bait and switch
one time i went in and there was another customer and i was completely ignored until hed made whatever ripoff sale he was trying to get him to buy
the patient rooms in back are well separated and provide more privacy than the previous office
she is so friendly and knowledgeable i feel so lucky to have her as a nurse and to have made my decisions based on her advice
these guys are awesome
bestphoenixdentist i have nearly 5k twitter followers blackpug and am not getting a freebie for this review
when we show up to the right office they act like they are not going to see us because we are late and say no one from the other office called them
they answered all the questions i wouldnt have thought to ask and all the ones that i did
stay far away
my grandmother has been going to specialists for years and no one has ever taken the time to explain things like dr levison
have been seeing drmilana for a few years now and highly recommend his office
there is lots of controversy about medical billing these days
great team great price
my boyfriend was looking for birkenstocks for work and he got great help with the owner
she has 3 locations and ive seen her at 2 depending on my schedule and hers
the health inspection should definitely consider giving that place a warning to get that place cleaned up completely
the woman at the check out was highly impersonal and rude as well
if my insurance didnt cover her they do i would pay out of pocket to see her
if shes in a good mood you will get the right treatments
they helped me lose 83 pounds
the lady that was giving me the massage told me to pick out a massage oil
the xray tech was friendly
i love the services at this wellness spa
first of all  dont offer the electronic app if youre not going to honor
not going to liemy first trip here i was not impressed
i am not saying that everyone should always wait for an hour to be seen but i do understand why doctors are usually late for their appointments
of course i opt for the resin and since i was going to pay in cash they give 10 discount
the customer service here is top notch and i was very appreciative that shylah was able to get me in at the last minuteright before she was to be going out of town for lash removal
i am forever grateful to this team of ladies
this should have been on their recording which would have saved me and probably other people a wasted trip
didnt even bother looking one up for me
everyone was so nice warm and welcoming
even the food was nice
this is a wonderful office for our whole family
kinda weird to be honest
wife ordered tea which was generic and unremarkable
it was only 40
it may not be in your best interest to make an appointment with him unless youre willing to wait or take his attitude
he then sent me to get an mri
its been a while since weve gone too long
just tried this new location luckily its so nice and professional skills
dr elis is one of the best diagnosticians and therapists we have ever met
the good the doctor is thorough but he ordered blood work that insurance did not approve to be medically necessarybut i still paid for it
the emt who administered my 1st step was even nice enough to chat her academic history to me while she stuck me
i love this doctor
i would highly recommend anyone that is looking to have any work done to check out hankins
was not excited the location near my house was closed but decided to make the long drive any way april rocks
most recently with what turned out to be a kidney infection
will keep you from taking advantage of any future mothers who may seek your services
pricey but worth the money being spent you only get one can body invest in your health
i needed an mri for a hip tear and the pa refused to send me
best part about it they couldnt even tell me why i owed that money
the room was quiet and comfortable with tranquil music on
my nails came out awesome
she could have easily just given me a gown
my father had an infection in his stomach his kidneys were failing breathing was shallow and i could go on and on i want to thank ion alexie the infectious diseases md
i had a full mommy make over in september 2014 breast augmentation breast lift tummy tuck
i love that they even have a daycare great for parents working out
i never write reviews but i rely on reviews that others writeso i wanted you all to know not to waste your money on this onetoo many better places in this city
so we get into the room the doctor barely walks in the room looks at his eye mumbles on for 15 seconds tells us hes going to print his paper work and hell be right back
diuretics are not good
the made an appointment for me the same day
ive been to other locations and usually everyone is competent but this location and this whole experience seemed like a huge waste of time
after the second session and herbs i got 4 hours of consecutive sleep
i bought the same living social deal as the other reviewer
the nurses receptionists and even volunteers went out of their way to make my family and i feel safe and at ease during a difficult time
i no longer dislike going to the dentist its actually an enjoyable visit
so as we were walking to the door this not so friendly guy in an orange shirt was standing outside the foot spa and i think smoking a cigarette
im no newbie when it comes to getting dental worki know a good dentist  practice when i see one
overall i would highly recommend arizona oral facial  implant surgery to anyone needing to have their wisdom teeth removed
i have been to so many dental offices because of so many various reasons but i now found a place where i feel comfortable and am greeted cheerfully
she just made a confirmation call the day before saying 8am
i said well i should have been in front of them and she said theres nothing she can do for me
again sofia came to the rescue and fed my daughter while dr cotton and i went over some stuff and the guy that works there i wish i could remember his name
they had several brands that i wasnt familiar with
and they do this while working with patients in great pain and dealing with uncooperative and difficult insurance companies
their lack of attention to detail and their awful attitudes always had me leaving in a bad mood
by this time im thinking  boy this place has horrible customer service
the ownerhas clearly be set up by somebody with money
worst pt care not compassionatehave been in several hospitals my teen daughter had major spine surgery  this is the wordt patient cate i have ever seen
the ladies here were very knowledgeable and experienced
please look into fixing this
i have no cavities my bite is perfect and my teeth look great
the problem is that i am now receiving letters from them still charging one of the fees and when i called to address the issue the lady couldnt care less about what i told her and told me only one was waived and if i didnt pay they were going to send me to collection
the office staff is wonderful as well
she was great but again i was seen as the first time mom so she left the room but told me to continue to push
her administration staff has always been a joke
umm ok i laid him down and was trying to get my daughter out of the way and she yelled at me grab hands
oh and after 6 weeks of badgering them to find out what happened to new referrals i kept having the doctors office send over someone finally went back into their system far enough and found the original order
horrible uninformed office
unlike hubby who comes only twice a year
i am one of those people that are terrified of dentists
felt very appreciated as a patient
i looked into some cross fit gyms as well but none seemed interesting to do as a couple to better our physical fitness
the service was also great and yes the guy who came spoke english and they are licensed and bonded
according to the center the salt in the water buoys up the body and also pulls impurities from the skin to the surface where they are either dissolved or washed off
fact of the matter is that its as good as any i have been too
they will ask you why
shes very fast and good at what she does
other doctors gave me grim diagnosiss but he said the surgery would be 20 minutes and a piece of cake
he told me heidi is a miracle worker
nice facility nice receptionist and i liked their ready made orthotics
found my favorite massage place
after a night of being forced to lay in urine all night the next day i was taken to umc with a high fever where i was admitted on iv antibiotics for the uti that had progressed and become systemic
both times i went in i did not wait long at all
i definitely recommend this dentist
i had not expected this level of results
i was very impressed with nate and his knowledge of numerology
been navigating through the website for 10 min
karen really helped to ease my nerves
suck it up buttercup and get some thick skin and deal with it
actually took off the blood pressure cuff and pulse monitor on my finger as it was bothering me machine was beeping for a good 20 minutes before i shut it off myself and not one person checked in to see what was going on  once the nurse came and got me for the chest x ray i asked him if it was a busy day and he said actually no it is pretty slow today  was discharged without a clear diagnosis and more questions about what was wrong with me than when i walked in   i have been around health care my whole life and have never experienced or seen such a low level of customer service and care all around
i fell asleep
everything in this gym is new and top notch
so i dont really understand why they even did it
i recommend to all my friends
from the moment i walked in the door i instantly felt at peace
they office was welcoming and efficient handling my insurance and appointment
while they do not dispute this fact they insist i was refunded yet i never received the refund
i mean really hated it
my exam was thorough painless and anxiety free
finally i called pvwc and made the drive to see dr howard
dr dembicer is one of a kind
i was prescribed oxycotin by the er doc as the pain is terrible keeping me from eating sleeping or even wanting to talk
his office staff are very rude talk to you condescending and rude
the office is centrally located in phoenix and has an abundant amount of parking spaces
any time i have needed it in the past she has been more than willing to fit me in when an emergency pops up
the staff is very friendly knowledgable and helpful
im a big chicken i dont do pain at all
you will received surprise bills you should never be responsible for
however i was given trial contact lenses listing my prescription
everyone there is very nice and helpful
i called to make an appointment and was told it was walk in only first come first serve
he payed no heed and froze a hole on my chest leaving me with a scar
as for the cutwell you gave me exactly what i asked for
theyll even grocery shop with you if you need help getting on track with eating better
talk about a girls dream come true
so glad i did not let the community setting steer me away
the staff could not of been more accommodating or helpful
i want to sanitize my girl and not let her touch anything while in the waiting rooms
if the policy is for customers only that is understandable but at least state the rules in a polite manner
i ordered a pair and have been using them for several weeks now and my neck is much better
i believe they recently outsourced the front desk personnel
all in all infinity health centre only has the right ambience but lacks everything else
everyone at this office is super nice and friendly
if you think of the overhead required to pay for all the wages that money has to come from somewhere
lied to me when saying what my cost would be
she then stamped it and said nothing
i got my teeth cleaned and had some xrays done and had them check out a tooth that had been bothering me
dr venugopal is the best
hed shove some antibiotics in my hand and send me away
there is one great dentist in there
my nurse michelle made my labor amazing
went there today november 27th to order shakes with my girlfriend
rude and dismissive nurses and employees and i couldnt find a trash can or box of tissues to save my life
made an appointment a month ago
almost every time i see him he tells me something i dont know about dental practicescience
he is very hands on and pays attention to his practice
they have a lot of great items for sell
i wish her the best i am so dramatic when it comes to needles and shots but after she did breathing exercises she got me to calm down
as i was laying there thinking how off putting and expensive this experience has been thus far i actually looked up their reviews online yes should have done that before and found that my feelings were confirmed by past patients experiences
and they actually make it fun
my only complaint is the lack of parking near the store but its great for anyone who works nearby
so i had to pay for it twice and endure pain for weeks
i love it
keep in mind this was just a checkup
we were not rushed through dr check ins
in my humble opinion anyone complaining about wait times or petty frustrations of dealing with a busy practice simply dont understand how lucky they are to have him
what kind of business doesnt ask for insurance right away
reasons  i sent a message via yelp to the company asking if they could give me a ring to go over my options in scheduling an appointment
average wait is two hours if youre lucky
100 recommend making this your go to eye care place
but since i waited a week for this appointment and was so eager to start i decided go ahead anyways
it was my second time seeing a chiropractor and had previously only seen a chiropractor one time
just sorry your out of luck basically
dr zuch is now my dr for life
i made an appointment for a 90 minute session here 5 days in advance and upon arrival was informed that no appointment was scheduled
i was so surprised by this style of service
life wears you down be proactive against more
she helps only where it is needed and allows the body to find its balance
whats his position
you schedule a 7am appt
we cant thank them enough for taking us in and helping with the surgery for a low cost
through his assistance he has been peeling back the layers of injury throughout my life healing both chronic and shortterm problems without fail
he has such a gentle hand
dont waste your time and money at any other place
i wish i could have read some of the reviews here before going there
we were visiting from out of state massage my dad who has arthritis and issues with muscles and inflammation on the leg came here to relieve some tension and he said he felt great afterwards he had joy for his massage
there was also great service
no time was wasted
the doctor came out of his office greeted me with a smile and asked my to come and sit in one of the dental chairs
if not then certainly he is quirky and has difficulty remembering dates and times
the first point of contact is crucial
dont believe your nightmare ends when you walk out the door
do not come here
kim assured me she was going to hire more people and get another room which it sounds like she did
when i asked him about the antibiotic he had trouble telling me about it
i have to say goodbye to this dental clinic not because of dr gohbut the his staff
i was very hesitant to change my previous obgyn that i had been going for over 10 years but since i moved a little to far i had no choice
no waiting time when i got there filled out paperwork went straight back provider was in the exam room with 5 minutes
i appreciate the helpfulness and understanding nature of everyone in that office
ive been to a lot of dentists in my time and if i had to give a referral  id say hes the best dentist in the east valley
i definitely found my new eye doctor
the doctor was a young man and he was so patient with me
my wife was told in my presence she was to wait 2 weeks and then see an orthopedic surgeon of her choice for a follow up
my friend witnessed the entire call since it was on speakerphone and can attest to the content of the call her rude demeanor and her inability to tell me what the bill was for
she was completely rude and rubbed me the wrong way
came here as recommended by my np friend
the nurse was a sarcastic b
the front desk hassle here doesnt compare to the hospitals so grit yo teeth and bear it
came in to make a payment  stood at the front desk for 15 minutes and nobody helped meand you wonder why i dont pay every single visit
even without those moments in mind the massage itself was just okay but didnt really leave me relaxed
hes calm and patient
they warned us on the phone that we had probably waited to long to come and see them but we decided to try any way
up until the last month or so this office would have scored a consistent 3 stars the entire time i have been going there over the last 8 years  yes they are a mass dentist office but with the right dentist in the office they were efficient reasonably priced and the front office staff was friendly and helpful
i really like the online booking system which makes the booking process convenient for busy individuals
they had physical therapy every day and her recovery was quick
the pa told my husband that he might need to come in every month to get his medication for his hypogonadism
she is wonderful
worth the money
we will definitely be back when we are ready for another baby
i hope we never have to go back again to that er
id come in distraught to work and the employer asked what was wrong
he said lets work on getting you pain free well worry about payment later his staff are polite friendly and professional
well im glad i did
words cannot express how happy i am to have found dr zacher
they take the pain out of going to the dentist er otolaryngologist
i had an appointment here last friday and the lady that did my ct was awesome
she said yes
angel blessings is a hidden gem
i dont think ive ever waited over 15 min
he is amazing
seeing dr collins has been a life changing experience
ive already found a new primary care physician i interviewed a few who took my insurance and checked out yelp and healthgrades online and its all for the better  i trust my new doctor so much more and i doubt he would do the disservice to his patients that dr carfagno scottsdale sports medicine institute did
he has transformed my hand and released stress i never knew i was carrying
it seems like they look for poor reviews and comment to slightly better their image
there was no emotional support during the hospice and after my mom who lived with em in my home passed away
bought a whole bunch of new wires off the internet myself because was tired of asking and waiting for wires every so often
thats why 2 stars
he didnt even tell me that the photo was taking when i was taking the shot for the health card talk abt an embarrassing shot there
they provide towels to cover up if necessary but those are barely hand towels overall ive had a pretty good experience
they kept telling him it was him who could not adjust
a whole crapton of tests later which all eliminated anything terrifying i reinterated to the nurses that after the last test im pretty positive i knew where the bleeding was and that i think kim missed seeing it because of me being a big woman the extra fat i have down there kinda kept the wound closed unless provoked and because he was so quick and wasnt willing to look
for me body work is essential to the dream i am chasing runner   and so her deep tissue is the best i have ever gotten and i have lived all over the country and worked with a  lot
and she was sweet
perhaps best of all she has retained her vermonter sensibilities and sense of humor and this goes a long way when dealing with a complex case
they got my daughter right in and out and they have now taken five different tests and now we have been sitting waiting for four and a half hours
then this is your place
they were extremely patient and super helpful the whole time
everyone has told me that my cataract surgery could be put off for months with no problems other than a gradual decrease in vision
i couldnt have picked a better doctor for this process
it is a little pricey to continue on once your groupon expires
lastly i am a la leche league member and very active in breastfeeding circles
i had a male chiropractor his name escapes me and he was very knowledgeable and explained the process
centrally located in downtown plenty of free parking modern facility and great customer service
ive been to other doctors and they have been ok but dr chao and his staff are my favorite
she also brought me a cold bottle of water
she is wonderful
harris dental is truly the best in the business for everything dentist daily cosmetic and everything in between
my labor was short only about 4 hours
her attitude was one of complete disinterest
my old masseuse moved and i went through a few new ones trying to find a good one
2nd im finally called in the assistant kept asking the dentist drpatel for guidance which i understand if your a newbie but found out she wasnt
never have i met a dentist with more compassion and understanding for my discomfort
located in mt lebanon close to scott township i have been very pleased with all they have to offer
youll be so very glad you did
hes very knowledgeable and genuinely interested in helping you be healthy
however you are getting tattooed in the back room where all artists work in the same room
totally not worth it
if you dont  by all means proceed
i have had countless bad experiences in medical offices and usually dread going
obsessed with consistency ive always tried very hard to deal with one doctor and one doctor only
one suggestion more parking space
at a dentist office
as far as the letter the previous reviewer received i got one to and never missed an appointment
am i scared
he was very concerned about any discomfort i may be experiencing and took steps to minimize it
if she got my teeth lookin good
when the contacts came in i went to the office and the girl at the front treated me like a moron and told me its for 6 months
i live and work in downtown cleveland and so the office location is a perfect fit for me
she inspected his mouth again and noted how mobile his tongue was as how good his suck was before again bringing up cutting his lip and tongue ties
i have had 2 other surgeries after this one done by dr hernandez and its all been the same type of loving generous caring experience
dr patel and his entire staff are wonderful
they are completely overbooking because the wait has become out of control
i heard it took at least 2 weeks to make an appointment but i had no problems whatsoever
a great dentist and great staff
dr byrd did an amazing job at examining and cleaning my teeth
he will rather defend his incompetent staff than take care of his patients
they were amazing and tried to save us money rather than upsell
i was worried they would look fake or just wrong because im 100 asian and have platinum blonde hair
seriously fifty freaking miles who is going to drive that far to get a massage
i think this place is pretty good
unlike the dentist i love coming here
the first time i heard about the concept of a sensory deprivation tank was many years ago from a tv show called fringe
for the past 8 years i have been seeing dr white and he has helped alleviate my fears of having my teeth messed with
the great they have babytoddler frames in house
my appointment was at 330 but we started at 345 then we also ended at 432 i was told it was an hour
to make sure she had it right
i mean my wife goes to couple massages but this place is nicemassage is good
all of their staff are friendly and very helpful
on visiting the facility for my calcium score test l was told that the test is worth 71 dollars
love the office staff the hygienists and of course dr joe hufanda and his assistants
i would recommend anyone come to visit her healing center for quality work
this has got to be the worst medical supply company in the history of mankind
i went to his office
i havent had this great of an experience at the dentist in years
i was with dr petrick for about 3 years in that time he not only helped get me stronger physically but also mentally  spiritually
my husband only wanted the ion detox and then a shoulder and back massage
upon arrival we were asked to fill out detailed paperwork asking for insurance information
i will definitely be back for my 3rd time and etc
she enjoyed watching the movie on the ceiling as she laid in the chair and she was thrilled to have so many toothbrush options to choose from
from previous reviews it seems like they spend a very short time with the patient
if i can ill go back every time were in vegas
contacting the office via phone is literally not possible
it was pure hell trying to find a family doctor in toronto that i could see regularly i spent over a year just trying to get an appointment somewhere but this clinic made it worth the wait
came here for the first time today
shr told me he was already gone to lunch  it would be another office call
terrible terrible terrible
she continued on and was downright rude and degrading
wasnt going to happen it wasnt like they used a ton of materials or anything
paid it i am now coming in to evaluate the botox 3 wks latet now ashley in billing said a mistake was made on
he says yvette was one of the best hes ever had and is already talking about coming back
knowing my anxiety she moved along with ease never dropping a beat with her lively conversation and using a reaffirming tone that things will be ok that was greatly appreciated
out of 5 outpatient facilities i have experienced in town for various reasons this one has the most amazing staff
dr chen has been kind enough to repeat everything several times for various family members as well as allow us to record her
the wait to be seen is always long and there is no waiting room
shop around with your insurance help
i was smart enough to sneak out of there after they wouldnt perform an early us on me at 6 weeks due to previous ectopics they wanted to wait until 8 weeks which by then could have been too late
on the website they state that theyre the official ent dr for the az diamondbacks
she is a gem and im so happy to have found her
the next day saturday i went in for my one day postop check up
i need to go to the gym first in person then i can book classes online
you wont regret having him as your orthodontist
been coming here for 25 years and have had a great experience every time
i have sleep and wake problems and she has helped me with both
the register lady saw me stand in front of her but didnt care
i highly recommend brookstone dental if youre looking for honest and professional care
i didnt have to wait too much longer to see dr jorge and he was great  a very nice guy intelligent and it was evident that he saw me as a person and not just another patient
if you get a chance to go make sure you ask for tom
at the end he had to pay 1060 for 2 little pills haha
when you enter body envy for your workout you are greeted by the trainers within minutes and the way they run their workouts is similar to a crossfit gym without the crossfit atmosphere
first class all the way around and my knee feels great
he said ok oona im gonna really need you to breathe for this next part
i cant say enough about how unprofessional this office and medical staff is
i would never recommend this place to anyone
my hygienist anna was a breath of fresh air in my history of dental exams
so bedside manner is non existent and he really didnt take time with me to do a proper cancer screening
i think at the end of the day he is an excellent physician and does a great job with his office and staff he is only human and when hes exposed to patients that are interesting and probably intellectually close to him he truly enjoys the interaction
i wont go into the gory details but i had an ingrown toenailew i know
location is good for me will be back thank you fran g
my husband needs this procedure
and prices are equal
25 for a regular pedicure and she was mad i didnt upgrade and tried real hard to convince me otherwise  which i didnt have time for at the moment
he takes the time to come and say hi and make you feel like a person instead of just a patient
they made us feel very comfortable and welcome
what kind of urgent care doesnt have a doctor available
it was honestly one of the best massages ive ever had
i told the driver the quote i was given and that i didnt have a lot of cash
i unfortunately have not been blessed with good teeth
took both of my sons her for over two years and during that time they managed to mix up my childrens charts and give one a very high dose of sedation
great service friendly staff good prices
michael my massage therapist came and got me promptly at my appointment start time
i stopped going to my other salon due to poor service and ugly nails
dr sheperd and anita make a great team and the front staff is so friendly
she watched me nurse diagnosed my baby with ankyloglossia and said my child wont be talking until shes 4 unless its revised however a speech therapist nurse midwife and two physician assistants all said her tongue is normal and shouldnt affect speech development
he answered all my questions using terminology that was simple to understand
i too found dr aspacio lacking manners
i understand there are multiple patients as well as emergencies but when you have a sick kid it would just be nice to be told you might have to wait awhile so i can at least not get irritated while i wait with my irritable child
great bedside manner
i went to a local shop i was able to get the sunglasses and frames for 24575
echo other comments re attitude of staff both in er and 4th staff
the two doctors i have visited  my family doctor currently on maternity leave dr theman and her replacement dr lorde are young female doctors yay
loyal employees of 8 years 15 years 21 years 37 years have all become victoms and pushed out
he cares about his business and answered all my questions
there is a cozy fireplace and drinks available
the place is actually pretty spacious and you will get called into your own secluded cubicle as the masseuses become available
when you see just bubbles thats just built up gas thats more important than actual waste coming out
so now every time im in vegas which is every 6 months or so i make an effort to see dr higo
i was at the centre waiting for around 45 mins to get seen which was quite a quick turnaround
i explain that if he feels it is not fixable then i wont continue trying to find a doctor
anyway back to my point i tried to cancel in february and was told it was as simple as providing a letter of cancellation
i purchased skin care at this clinic but i was not impressed
they used hot stones and wet towels
i initally scheduled a massage and adjustment in one appointment jing advised me that i should not get one today because i am so tight
then i had to fight with them over my payments and insurance company
i have never been to a dentist let alone any medical facility that takes the time to explain to their patients exactly what they are doing every step
he promises it will heal in 10 days so i will update then
ive been coming here for years and its just gotten worse
point is they should have told me hey your not going to get the full hour and i wouldve just rescheduled
due to his assistant talking down to me so rudely while i cried to her not understanding what is going on  what happened
mimi was very professional and has great  techniques
the instructions said to leave the whole page blank and just sign at the bottom
the staff here is very friendly and they took me as a walk in when my other dentistry staff was rude and nasty
boy was i lucky to find these guys  gals
i highly recommend the services here at metaphysical mama
not only can she give you a beautiful smile but she is very informative gentle and kind
i have bought about 2 pair every 2 years and have always had a decent expeirience except this time
now i that it has happened on two seperate occassion i think this is just the way that massage envy does business
fool me once shame on you fool me twice will never happen
that said i havent once regretted waking up a little early to make it
the service at the front desk was fast and friendly
if i didnt already have a dentist i love and nearer to me id be signing up to have dr schwartz be my dentist
he was so nice and caring and explained everything to me that was going on with my eyes and they type of glasses that he wanted me to have
never addressing my concern that the math didnt work out
this doctor is even worse than dr mohajer
my husband had to ask the anesthesiologist
my husband and i and our eldest daughter age4 love dr leung
i gave this one star because it didnt allow me to give it zero
most neurologists seem to come across overbearingly proud of their skill and this is where dr lovell is different
seen by carlie fox  she was very knowledgable friendly and informative
i love this place
nurses came in to shower him in front of us and everytime they needed to check on him he was never taken away
went to this office to have my son checked for what seemed like a sinus infection and to look at a dozen ant bites on his arm
it was bizarre
i was not given any wipes to clean myself off
i will not be returning to this dr for my healthcare needs and will definitely not recommend him or his office to anybody
thank you modern medical
she really goes above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect
but i was still fine with that take x ray because i thought it was only going to be 30 40 for x ray i took it before
having just gotten out of my first trimester this massage felt amazing
look no further
terrible office dont go there
we werent able to get very good images so she had us come back in an hour
finally i called the appointment line and the lady put me on hold but i could hear her telling the nurse that she was going to tell me they just couldnt call me back because my number wasnt working
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation machine i jokingly call it electric shock therapy for my back
he has terrible verbal skills
my blood pressure when up to 18590
my regular dr can never squeeze me in when i am sick but lv urgent care can and my wait time was minimal
i havent ever noticed anyone out of scrubs and no booty shorts
he seem weird and very odd
you would probably get more help from a crackhead then this place
are wonderful as well
this was the best damn massage ive ever had before
dr goates and his staff are simply wonderful
dr denton is caring and has amazing customer service
makes your visits really enjoyable
he talks more than he works
i was told about this office by a friend who gets all of her dental work done here
i had full trust in her that she would execute my desired outcome
when i mentioned it he shoved a paper with colored graphs in front of me and asked well did you ever have this test
my kids love the playroom there and usually dont want to leave
save yourself endless troubles embarrassment and your hard earned money
seriously do not not waste your time or money going to this place
my kids are asking when were going next they want to spin the giant wheel
the change room is equipped with lockers just make sure you bring a lock or bring your valuables into the practice room where they have little partition for your to store your stuff
i decided to hang around the area and call back
this place is awesome
last visit didnt go over the xray
i called them back because he said he did not get a shot
kind of a biased publication that rewards paying members
in addition dr powell is on vacation quite frequent so leaving limited space for appointment
it was better than waiting in an emergency room
in my previous job i was always on the road and could stop in at any location and get adjusted
my heart sank
the facility will adhere to your wishes
not the kind of thing you want to see at a medical clinic
i myself work in healthcare and this is definitely unacceptable
as soon as my wife and i entered we were promptly greeted by the front desk
i finally decided to call to schedule an appointment last week i would have called sooner but i was pregnant and wanted to wait until after my baby was born
my husband and i are seen here as well as our 4 children
before he did any adjustment he ensured he was telling what he was going to do
it was from start to finish a fantastic experience
she always asks where i am having discomfort and is great at addressing my pain points
you would think he would at least attempt to be more polite to clients that are paying 80 per visit
he will not do work that is not needed
called hpon and was told only emergency room and urgent care provider visits are covered when out of state
the staff is wonderful and dr tim is so great with the kids
i was going from a super dark cool toned boxdyed brown to my natural colour a medium ash brown
i hate to wait even  when im way early
they motivated me to strenghen my core and to realize that this will be a life long commitment
im just in disbelief
she called me at 630 and said they were calling in a refill
i was seen by dr bourgeois who works tuesdays and thursdays
freshly washed towels are placed on you and the couches
i did demand a number to call to complain and will never be back
really great guy who gives back to his community
im having a very bad experience with this office i would like to share
my immediate concern was how and why would mens health promote 4 different products in a similar way so i contacted them on their facebook page and email
must be alot of kenyans living in that area also because one lady literally looked like she just came out of the bush with her 3 kids
the is ridiculous and maybe get someone more knowledgeable answering the phones
lots of cross fit built into the workouts
i had to go to the office in person several times to put pressure on them to get my referral done and to get signatures since they wont call anyone back
way better value and service
her room is setup really nice great aromatherapy scents nice music relaxing table to lay on table warmer was perfect
i get a call thursday saying that my results came back inconclusive because they didnt get enough of a sample and i need to come back
i told him that i would be sure to use that nasal spray he suggested
im a dysport junkie all the way
they were so personable
and they are fast
thats the bottom line isnt it
came to hangover heaven paid 250 and left an hour later feeling as if i had no drinks at all
my skin was definitely not that dry to have to squirt lotion on her hands every 5 seconds
originally when i first started coming here there was always a problem every single time i came
my crown came off last week so i went in to get it replaced
the next time i have an emergency i will demand to talk to the doctor or natacha
i saw dr aspacio for my yearly skin cancer body check
the entire staff is super nice
there are two locations located in the city  southwest and henderson
very sweet therapist who checked in often about strength she used
this is a great place to go get your teeth fix
overall this clinic is cheap and fast if you have no insurance so i would recommend it
you can be assured you are in good hands
we thoroughly searched for a doctor while expecting our first child
we are so lucky to have him basically around the corner from our house
as i lay there crying my eyes out with my mouth wide open he continued to get the food out and never once asked me if i was okay
i told him i was a disabled cancer survivor  we talked about blood work but he didnt seem concerned enough for me to be confortable
i told them cancel all appts right there and refund the rest
she is extremely knowledgable professional and fabulous
he is a young talented friendly nail tech with a steady hand and easy conversation style
so he wasnt going to wait for nothing
i had a good feeling once i walked into this super clean office
i understand people are irresponsible  some clients can be anything but pleasant
for starters you never see the same doctor
and the therapists ive been going to are excellent
all while racking in the
this family of dentists brothers are quality individuals and outstanding dentists
his bedside manner is considerate and compassionate
my therapist moved 5 weeks before my family was going to las vegas
its all about commission and they really have no real idea of what your insurance will cover
how can anyone do that
my acne cleared up and never came back although my skin is horribly and unnecessarily scarred now
got my vaccinationsshots and was out the door within an hour
jessica lucero is who i normally see and am very pleased with the care and professionalism i receive each time i am there
the administration is one big cluster at reach with no customer service skills
my friend said i was told that this procedure costs 2000 when i spoke to you on the phone
i am sure dr martin is great in these capacities
thats how it appeared
we travel 90 miles just to see heather and eva and its worth it
probably more toppings but thats all i could remember
got a small tattoo while i was there
that is after being pinned under my vehicle while face down on the street black pigmentation from the asphalt remained on my face for years after healing
they are both amazing doctors whom i would happily refer to my friends and write a yelp review for   the only downside at this highland office is that the front office staff always seems stressed and irritated
i tell him what im feeling and he sends me on my way to a specialist or the pharmacy
and that includes the helpful nonselly store clerk
thanks to the dr for his patience with me and to the staff who have me their honest feedback and are so nice and helpful
she is great
he the began to tell me about the surgery and started threatening me with the risks of surgery
i also let doctor z know that i was experiencing horrible belly and flank pain
dont put it off you deserve to live a life headache free
there was also some guy waiting for a treatment and his spiked hair and tight shirt indicated that he had guidolike tendencies
if i could give 100 stars i would
you walk up to a door across the room the door to the lab you write your name in on a signup sheet and then you ring a fucking door bell
cha shu  thicker and grilled
great set up professional modern setting
i left crying and in so much pain
highly recommend them if you need a dermatologist
not in touch with recent studies and data
i already told you i had a doctors appointment in a few days
they flip you over and finish off with your back legs and shoulders again mixing in some hot towel treatments
also im pretty sure they have extended hours and are open on weekends to accommodate any busy schedule
but dont worry there are flatscreen tvs and autographed sporting memorabilia that can help distract some of the sweat
the selection is also great they arent pushy in any way and are very helpful
i originally went in to the office with a groupon offer for a cleaning
i recently moved here from colorado and needed a facial
next time ill take my business elsewhere
i decided to try this place again because they already had all of my information on file and i thought maybe my first experience was a fluke
i actually had trouble finding the place and was about 5 minutes late
he tried to apologize by sending me to a dermatologist and then the manager wouldnt pay the dermatologist bill
overheard a lady mention putting her membership on hold
the thing is a doctor should be honest especially pediatric doctors
carmen did a great deep tissue and sherman was awesome for my husbands first time getting a massage
walked in w a painful toe injury and he fixed it
i feel very lucky that my family has such a great dentist local to us
there are not enough words in the english language to tell how much i truly appreciate that man
her staff is great
im not even sore after the numbness wore off
professional and very kind staff
my ankle was dislocated and my leg was broken in two places
i started with an eye exam went well
the staff showed me how to brush my teeth right and made recommendations so i dont have to come back for more fillings in the future
cant wait to go get another massage
ill start with the most important thing the workouts themselves every time i have stepped into the gym there i have experienced a challenging and adaptable workout
a big thank you to both
as a 24 year old i enjoy sleeping in late
she didnt mention my weight one time and that made me feel comfortable as a plus size mom who already knows she is too large
he wrote it up as a cold and told me i did not have asthma
the postpartumrecovery unit was just as comforting
he is so helpful with scheduling and super supportive
i only found out the day i tried to schedule my iud insertion
we look forward to seeing her
they have a huge selection and if you are in need of anything they will order it for you
i have been working out at orenda force for 4 months and it is fantastic
on monday i called again the corporate person told me it did arrive at the store and gave me the store number to call
i knew i had to find a masseur fast when i got here someone who knew their stuff
well when i check out they said i had to pay my contact exam myself and theyd give me a receipt to submit to my insurance which was 50
enjoy the atmosphere  staff
i had an mri in sunday 7217 and the technician was amber q she was knowledgeable friendly and caring
the appointment was at 400 pm and we were 15 minutes early
you are fully dressed so wear something comfy i usually wear leggings and a tank top
in fact he acted so out of it that im not sure why he was at work at all
they should have taken care of the problem since it was related to the surgery that im sure dr pryor made thousands on
i had been here before they had closed down and the service was ok for a 38 run down
the best hot yoga around
i would recommend them
i came here on the second day of my phoenix vacation with several family members for a combination of facials pedicures and massages
i really appreciated how they are very transparent with costs this is extremely nice as i dont understand anything insurance and feel like some offices say things are covered and then you get a bill later
as someone who was in physical pain this person was not helpful or reassuring and frankly unprofessional
as far as the wait time i dont recall every having to wait for a long time to be seen by the doctor
dr ho is my hero
always incredibly nice
this place is also quite dirty
thank you so much reina you are awesome
the different lasers he has used with me he has always done so with utmost care and he has achieved fantastic results
he has a slightly dry sense of humor that helped my husband and i get through everything from the initial feelings that go along with a surprise pregnancy to the joys of having your cervix checked for 24 hours straight during labor
i dont cuss and am polite
his approach is unique hes personable and motivational
this place is awesome
thankfully we found a new doctor that will see him first thing tomorrow
the process of dealing with this is apparently the worst pain imaginable outside of childbirth i assume
it is safe effective and it is never boring
this is a 50minute session for cleaning out toxins from your body and also is suppose to help you lose body fat
this isnt a huge problem other than them being extremely pushy on the matter which is annoying
the delivery room was large with a tv and private bathroom
i was in and out in an hour and a half
im shocked by the level of disorganization by the lack of information given to us by our doctors how hard it is to get appointments
the start with the shoulders down the back move to the scalp and work you over
do yourself a favor and try this spa
they have pretty long office hours to fit your schedule
i have had both with another practitioner so i know what to expect
ive never had an issue with staff
ive had 3 different docs here all 3 were very nice gentle and willing to answer any questions i had
if you are looking for a top notch dentist in scottsdale call dr doug
this is how i will start this review
i like how for chiropractic he also introduces strengthening exercises to help correct you
very uncommon as i am often left to figure it out myself andor paying upfront and seeking reimbursement later
i really liked how they had a variety of glasses and sunglasses in different budget ranges
it was amazing
going to have to find somebody that seems to give a shit
they are very accommodating here and i was able to get in with an early morning appointment
i also took advantage of their 100 off a second pair
medicare does not cover what you put in your mouth
i understand she is popular and there is a shortage of good doctors but when its almost impossible to get in to see them when you need a doctor and when you finally get an appointment and its a three hour wait i think it is better to find someone else
unfortunately i had to come back for a second gallbladder problem there was a stone accidentally left inside
she tells me they use a variety of equipment to strengthen her muscles that were basically unused for 4 months and lots of stretching and rangeofmotion manipulation
i love dr most
from the time i enter where im greeted and all my questions answered accurately and cordially by the front desk manager to dr leila meeting all appointments on time to the highly trained dental assistantthis all around professionalism is so rare
once introduced to my float room it was gotime
pay no attention to the negative review below
he told me to come back the next day
came to get shots so my kids could go to school on the first day
he put my fears at ease made me do everything the right way and not the fast way and is a complete perfectionist
these all contributed to awesome results
its great for breakfast and it fills me up for the day
but i know that he did not perform the services that he build medicare for
sadly the increased census including increased amount of behavioral health patients has made for tough conditions for er staff and patients
theresa by the way is one of the few artists who mixes her own inks most others use inks straight from the tube
i really couldnt recommend erica enough as a birth photographer
i let it go to voicemail
totally recommend it to anyone who is going threw a rough patch after loosing their fur babys
she also made some insensitive comments regarding mental health issues
they were nice to me and the massage was very relaxing but one thing that really pissed me off is i called ahead of time to let them know i would be a little late for my appointment and they said oh no its fine come on down
dr weidner and her staff are all very friendly and attentive
both ladies who gave us the massage were friendly and the massage itself was good
the massage i received lasted 5 mins
two hours after coming home from my alignment i am able to sit and walk with much reduced pain
im a first time patient and called the office two days ago to schedule an appointment and was surprised at how fast they got me in
blue cross offered to speak to the employee and help them to understand
now all of a sudden ive got 4
a all around
literally horrible people to deal with
not only is it affordable but you can drop in almost anytime and be treated within minutes of arriving
it is better than before but after getting a painful shot i still feel pain and am limping around
in return there was no way i could see the doctor on the day of
the offices are clean beautiful and welcoming without the sterility
i would give high risk pregnancy center zero stars if i could
the problem is systemic within your business and how you conduct yourselves as a business mrs d
if youre new to the business i would recommend calling in advance of your appointment to confirm youre on the schedule
talked about what to do 2x2 s and 20 minutes later left for home
i would have loved to sit in the waiting room for any amount of time for a simple appointment to find out everything was ok
friendly service very clean up scale
these women are trash
have been a patient of dr wichnoski for several years
during the weekend i was having troubles and texted him and he was so personal and made sure i was comfortable till monday when he could see me
dr roberts who is married to dr roberts at my primary care doctor was really awesome
i am so easy to placate its pitiful but i was beginning to think id fallen down a rabbit hole
place is in he middle of the ghetto
my father was extremely satisfied with their professionalism and how accommodating they were
luckily by then i came to my senses and decided to cut my losses and go to a private and reputable optometrist clinic
they eventually got him up and took him in the back
im not in the habbit of accepting free services in an effort to buy my review and im fairly sure its also against yelp policies to do so
is at 9 am were called back at 9 am
speaking only of concentrates quality has been excellent until recently
she has such a warm bedside manner
i can not get through on the phone or on the website
i was then offered another extension for free this time to use up my unused massages
he was thorough in all of his answers and took his time with my exam never seemed rushed or annoyed
when to new eyes for cataract surgery and to fix a astigmatism
then i sent her a second email asking her to reschedule my appointment and still did not hear back and on the third attempt she informed me that because i had not paid her a deposit she would not let me schedule any appointments at her practice
ausserdem ist es werktags angenehm leer und man kann alles entpsannt nutzen
he has great bedside manner and most importantly the treatment worked
they have specials that are sent to your text and email and i get a free 30ml bottle of juice for my birthday
i guess thats what you can do when youre the only dispensary in town thank god i dont live in fountain hills
she told me that there was no cure for it
they cant make any money off of you
it feels so good to put things in my body that are naturalthat wont harm me and that wont become addicting
some might find this bothersome but i actually appreciated it because i dont like a general full body massage
my persistent pain was almost 80 gone
they have a quest draw station there so you dont have to go elsewhere to have your blood drawn
i dont pretend to know how their system works but if you are sending good and consistently paying clients to collections there is something wrong
so damned glad that i do my research i advise others to do the same
i absolutely love this studio
love it love it
i plan on updating this review as the next couple days go by so far ive been here for just over a day and honestly most of the entire staff here is terrible
oh and half their produce is always bad so make sure to check it carefully
she was reading all my records test and images from the hospital stays 3x and she ran her own test as well
optical thirty8 is an excellent place for shop for eyewear and i will definitely shop there again
he needs a few more extractions on his damaged teeth but we wont come back here for those
i was brushed off from the moment i walked in until i walked out
dr hawkins was my primary doctor throughout my entire pregnancy but she did not end up delivering me
so i found good review at yelp and went to here
i was actually okay with the almost 1hour wait because it gave me time to browse frames
robert does not rush and places a great amount of emphasis on detail
lashes look real and gorgeous
so i would be seeing the other doctor in the practice a male
most surgeons are very to the moment do what they must and get on with what they do
do not go here
the best part of this gym is the one on one care you get and the sauna is heaven
when i went in it wasnt very busy but i still waited almost 2 hours before even being seen
i thought what the heck lets see what this is all about
vein center this place is amazing
out of all 8 pictures colored and black and white one picture came out good
they also did some sort of evaluation that measured tooth density i think  honestly cant remember it was something id never had done and it was a little over my head
last night my father was transported by ambulance from the base hospital to sunrise
and was told no
great experience and will continue using this facility
dr chen is professional and thorough
dr drew avoids the heavy torque by leaning into your body with weight and uses a quick pull approach that does wonders
oh and fyi the customer is always right
i ordered a pair of regular glasses and a pair of sunglasses
if the resurrection was going down at procare medical centeri would skip it
so no 5 stars but a 4
had a bad sinus infection
i wear a dexcom continuous glucose monitor cgm and i was going to spend july in europe so i wanted to ensure that my supplies would arrive on august 1 upon my return my last sensor would expire on july 30
i was handed another copy and was patiently given a chance to ask any questions that i may have had
i feel like a 1000 pounds is lifted off my lower back after using dts decompression traction treatment
the first time i called i talked with the receptionist and she said i couldnt come in for a week
this is ridiculous
save your self
i might have to go through another round of h pylori meds as well which is the real cherry on top of everything
i would rather get my own
i was allowed to book by email and got a time that suited me
i dread calling this place to make any appointments or ask any medical appointments because i know the very first thing i will hear is thank you for calling dp can you please hold
great dentist friendly staff awesome place
my massage was great too
they booked me for the next week which felt so fast but i was ready
als ich im herbst letzten jahres zum ersten mal dort war wurde nach einer ca
i called in around 120pm looking for a same day appointment after calling several other clinics most of which told me they could not take an appointment nor guarantee it would be less than a 23 hour wait
and let me say this is a week already passed since i got the fillings and ive been in excruciating pain and theyre very well aware off
people loved the fact they could share our day from the comfort of their own home and we loved that we got a simple wedding with a relatively small price tag
healthy futures saved my life
if you want to get in shape while having an absolute blast this is the place
he helps me get the best rates possible on my health insurance
melanie is very professional very kind and informational
and who could object to a set of guidelines that codify the best practices of the profession
service was fast and good
i dont dread seeing the dentist like i have in the past
he walked me through each procedure he was performing and made it clear to me where i needed to improve on my dental hygiene without making me feel ashamed or embarrassed
its been so long since ive heard her rave about her meals
needles should not hurt but if it does let the person know and pain will be relieved instantly
perfect for couple massage
dont waste your time or money
in my opinion administration should concentrate less on marketing techniques and more on providing staff with the resources they need to provide decent care to their patients
he said that every time he was there the doctor always found something to remove on him
it was the most comfortable doctors appointment ever
remember your business is only as good as your customers experience
the procedures and products ive purchased seemed to very reasonably priced
i get a little nervous when i look at reviews for a business any business and nothing but severely negative reviews are written within a very short period of time
this place is very clean
i have been coming here about every two months for a couple of years now to get my hair cut
im already loving the inches i lost and apparently it gets only better over the first night and am totally recommitted to living the healthy life once and for all
the eye doctor was even nicer
the whole staff is fantastic
best dentist i have been too
i had her signature ms olympia energy bomb smoothie the first time we went chocolate whey protein banana strawberry blueberry and oatmeal
they were professional very nice and it took less than 15 minutes
the office is slightly unconventional but in a good way there are two friendly dogs who roam around named tennessee and sheba and instead of individual rooms there are three patient bays set up more like cubicles
i dont want anyone else with an urgent medical problem to have to go through something similar
he always takes his time to explain what is going on with my eyes
the day of the wedding was absolutely stress free
i am placed in a sterile beige room where there is no caltron the electronic device
eye exams are 75
its clean and the staff is so helpful and nice
one time i called on a holiday and some guy answered with his music really loud and said the office was closed
the optometrist was thorough and took his time but there was no unnecessary waiting like im used to
there is a place that was better called happy feet off of tropicana and arville
horrible and manipulative
we have been through so many bad experiences lately with various doctors it was very refreshing to have someone listen to the concerns and seem to genuinely care about the best option for the child
took my daughter to umc quickcare
my first son went to another orthodontist in town and i was dreading having to do it all over again with my second son
one of us didnt feel well and could not do the massage and the owner was very aggressive and force him to be charged and didnt care if he is sick or not
versus i can get basic nameless brand glasses for 40 cad or less overseas eg
my wrist has been hurting for half year i went to many doctors but still hurt
now down for the service
they are very patient kind and encouraging
this is my 3rd session with silk skin laser spa and i cant believe how long its taken me to write this review
i have been a patient for more than 20 years
too bad she only works wednesday to friday
go here you will not regret it
the higher star ratings are few and far between
the have several different packages available
thank you amy
the clerical staff was accommodating and professional while the medical staff were amazing and fun
just finished invisalign which took much longer than expected so i have been to his office dozens of times
that is baitandswitch  plain and simplenothing else about it
i was 29 years old when i got braces and luckily i wasnt the only adult in braces i saw tons of people of all ages going through braces to straighten their teeth
our first visit here and we waited two hours before being seen by a dr when we clearly had a set appointment
its pretty big and well lite and there is a stage in the front where the instructor stands and they use a microphone to guide the practice
in my opinion this is absolutely dishonest they get to keep my insurances money and apparently have been doing this to others for some time reginas review was back in 2014 it is now 2016
i finally gave up and was pointed to a nurse to give me information when i asked to see another doctor
the only bad thing that came of my visit was that i have to wear more sunscreen on my face i hate that stuff so oily
this place is truly for kids
she makes all of her patients feel like theyre a part of her extended family
the dentist was seriously the biggest idiot i have ever talked to
its not because we received a bill from them
they rank them
third appointment i waited for 10 min in the waiting room and 35 minutes for dr agarwal to come in to do my sons circumcision
since dr nyamuswa and the other founding doctors left when comprehensive cancer bought them out this place is a joke
the final one was installed without showing it to me and i was asked to sign their letter of acceptance after it was installed
this last trip i met his wife who i didnt know was his wife
when i arrived at about 12pm
man schlendert einfach gerne durch die reihen stbert und lsst sich treiben um dann bei einer tasse glhwein zu verschnaufen
then i still went to her office and she didnt even do what it was suppose to be done
this is the closest ymca to my home we are so glad they are here
dr delsavo saw me next day after i called his staff and let them know what i had been going through also i was going to be a new patient
she is a sweetheart
i know its a funny way of locating doctors but im a funny guy the purpose of my visit was very general as i hadnt had a basic checkup in a long time however dr levins was thorough  more thorough than any doctor ive visited has been in a very long time
he is a great surgeon patient welcoming and professional
while the staff there is funny and competent i was hurt by the impression that they cared more about hanging crystal balls in their waiting room and ordering funky purple chairs than they were about respecting the best interests of their patient
i am now in the process of having a second tattoo removed as well
one guy his name is sunny he do really good job
and i love the little giveaway bag they give you after a cleaning
this is a very difficult review to write but essential for new clients
the doctor only saw me for maybe five minutes after i waited for nearly two hours
i wish someone would write a good review on this guy
tiffanythank you for keepn track of the scheduling for all of us patients
and the staff lynn melissa and dr gore could not be nicer or more helpful
like fabulous in fact if she was my dentist id sooo be able to deal
after we declined the hcg he left and we havent seen him since
we came back and again sooooo amazing
why would i continue to go somewhere that results arent guaranteed
dr hampton not only worked with me on options he stayed and talked with me about my issues
i was so relieved and grateful
he had the entire issue diagnosed surgery scheduled surgery performed and followup appointments taken care of all within 3 weeks of my first visit
michelle is the best
i wouldnt go here just be careful because you dont know what kind of attitude your getting
a masked doctor came in and waited for me to sit back up
the owner accused me of trying to ruin small business when i was trying to help with a web browser problem with firefox even sent screen shots of 3 browsers so she could understand what wasnt working the irony is no one person can ruin a business except the person running it
first he forgot the name of a drug he wanted to recommend to me and wandered out of the office to the nurses desk to ask his assistant
i have seen the results on many people that i have referred
five stars for the escape and finding a reasonable ent doctor for a small sinus issue
just wanted to warn others so they dont get pulled in by the misleading shady advertising
service was fine but if the billing doesnt coincide whats the point
i have to say i dont mind paying the initial cost for cool frames but holy crap
the staff members are very friendly and accomadating
grateful to the doctors for fixing my neck up and offering such healthful advice
my whole family and i go to him and are very happy
update i got someone on the phone and found out that im really on the hook to pay the additional 432
great office im getting b 12 shots changing my diet and losing 22 pounds down so far
the highlight of the trip to the money factory was the office manager who we were told was to explain the process
just had to share the news that dr rick and his amazing staff are the best in scottsdale in az or anywhere
ill take your co pay and charge your insurance company thank you very much
i thank you all for your service
ive gotten my hair done by annie and had laser hair removal by dee the owner
guess what they said i had zero cavities
mansoor mannie quassani is one of the first people you meet
you have a highly rated spa across the street only charging 55 flat rates
because the tooth was a molar it wasnt going to be as much of an issue losing it as it would be any of the teeth in front
everyone from the registration staff to the medical assistants preop rn circulating rn and pacu rns are attentive to my daughters needs friendly to the parents and truly care about my daughters carehealth
the problem i have with this business is it appears their marketing strategy is to offer very vaguely written intro pricing and its good one time only
i have a great eye for dirt dust whatever and this place was spotless
suddenly her tone of voice changed and she sounded frustrated with whoever was on the other end of the phone
who peed in her oatmeal
edited out play by play for clarity all in all the whole experience was awful
thank you thank you thank you for taking the time to get the right combination to make me happy
i especially love working with belinda
it is difficult to find a chiropractic office that runs business and patient care in this manner
a very helpful and caring staff
and she walks out of the room while we were talking to her
i believe her name was lydia
i am nearing the end of my treatment where barring any future injuries i will not have to go in for maintenance
would totally recommend
upon initial interaction laden got up into the customers face and says yes
which was super cool of him
they dont use disposable protection when taking your temp with that ear thing
the wife and i have found our spot for health wellness and plain relaxation
dr kish took her time explaining the best skin regiment i needed for all my concerns
needless to say i was in the market for a new dentist and wasnt exactly thrilled with my previous experiences
jan 11 2017  call to confirm that they are still running it though
the pricing was great because the surgery was done in house but that is it
having seen st joes and not being thrilled with the sterile hospitallike environment i fell in love with the serenity of scottsdale sheas birthing ward
i appreciate it very much
they have made a huge difference in my sciatic joint and thoracic pain
i laughed to myself when one medical assistant magically went from pleasant to passiveaggressively miffed when i elected to not follow her recommendation vs keep the original vaccination schedule
a year later when my husband still couldnt use them i called mccormick eye center and spoke to their optics department
you will feel awful for a month afterwards
he went from being a chronic catnapper and waking every hour or two at night to now taking longer naps and only waking a few times at night
it took the office more than 3 and a half hours to call me back and by then i was in the emergency room because the symptoms were so severe
they should be ashamed
you couldnt figure that out a little sooner than 3 hours before my appointment
we were a little more careful but still the only way to get there was either by car and queue in the same line as the kfc drive tru or walk from the railway side safest so many people decided to take the risk and cross the busy roads where ever possible
for example i didnt realize i would receive those forms online and downloaded the pdfs from their site to print and fill out
this makes life so much easier for me a busy professional
always a great experience
what made the process worst for me wasnt the wait it was the slightly rude service at the front desk
my smile was less than appealing  i always brushed and all that but my teeth were not straight
dr thomas huynh greeted me
very personable great attention to detail
gibson orthodontics completely changed how i felt about my smile
i felt so underdressed
i told my mom to go
the dentists are quite friendly and nice but the staff ranges from incompetent unfriendly confused unfocused but also occasionally quite nice too
i had a common problem after several weeks of healing  i wanted dr lille to resolve the problem but he refused  i was not happy at all
visited with the mother in law for a consultation on having a small growth removed from her chin
i would highly recommend this office
they finally did something about that horrible long line
it is crowded and a bit uncomfortable there but the standard of medical treatment cannot be beat
not to mention the b12 ala and vitamin d shots were pretty painless
i have and will always be grateful to abt for helping me get my life back on track again
i called another doctors office and come to find out my retina was almost completely detached and have had to have 3 surgeries to correct it because i waited and almost lost my vision permanently
i got a message by page and acupuncture for the first time
everyone was very knowledgeable and went out of their way to help
3 main reasons
they are conveniently located and open from 9am to  6pm
i went to a couple of other dentists in the area
if you have to stay here for a couple of days or weeks i wouldnt recommend it
they delivered as promised
i appreciate that ww makes an attempt to be relevant with the times with different trends however they still have a long way to go ie acknowledging vegans gluten free diet low sugar etc
he saved me a ton of money
3 as stated in previous reviews the staff will thoroughly welcome you and guide you through the process
she puts her patients first and is always available when needed
dr yanga and davion attended me
i have been seeing dr fitzmaurice since i broke my wrist in 2011  i tripped at a friends house and landed kind of gracefully on my wrist
the one downfall is dirty bathrooms
she began to tell me about how many men and woman she saw and their amazing results and that this program is truly what it says it is
very personable like a ole chum from cheers  she knows your name
i suffer from intense dental anxiety
she is like talking with a friend
i asked him what do i have and he said he didnt know
but doctor christensen was able to get him in that morning
i finally have some scripts for what this doctor deems is acute sinusitis
i highly recommend this office
danielle our wedding planner was so helpful and organize she just made our day so special
not only is it relaxing but it is also therapeutic
i have a congenital hiatal hernia that doesnt respond that well to my medication and some days i cant even stand straight because the pain is so terrible
i cant think without my glasses
dr brian and his team always makes my dentist visits a great experience
after being examined and having tests run it was determined he would need surgery
i would highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for quality service
i needed a lot of work done and due to neglect and hating the dentist office
so we asked our holistic vet if she knows of an excellent eye doc
i got five scripts and hopefully ill be feeling myself again soon
in motion also offers massage therapy
this is for any guest of the hospital and they only work on tips
she has a light touch and cleans your teeth really well
he helps me achieve lasting relief without pain medication
so far it has been wonderful
she the scribe made all the notes so that the doctor was able to sit and look me in the eye and actually be present during the appointment
talk about an all around self defense schoolnak has it all
if he doesnt have an answer for me he finds out
treated very respectfully but personal as every therapist has their own style
i was truly scared
called my insurance co when i got home and they stated that that was not true they do not ask for xrays and the fillings should be covered
she has such a dynamic and gentle disposition and it created ease and comfort for me
i recently got into an accident and didnt call her i will admit i may have been embarrassed as my driving record is not great
im a new patient here  having not found satisfaction with a few other dentists ive tried  but im here to stay with this group
the wait was long and annoying  but i had the entertainment of facebook to pass the time
ive always had knee issues but not anymore thanks to dr john
my whole family loves this dentist too
stay away from this quack
all the chairs in the office have big screen tvs in front of them and the assistant gives you a remote and channel list every time
this weight loss program does work i would definitely recommend it to everyone
if so why would i let you did this to me before my hurry event
dont go there
we they did it all for only about 300 over my yearly benefit
she took her time with our appointment and didnt rush or make me feel like i was another number
keep in mind i had a crown so he did a lot of work at or below the surface of my gum line
while i appreciate the yank yourself up by your bootstraps talk from friends and family its probably the least professional help ive ever received
there are only two positive reviews read shills for this company both are from nearby in az
just think about how bad it would really have to be to make someone crycause it was that bad
question de choix moi jaime bien papoter
2 they promote natural means of giving birth whenever possible
the team there works directly with you to help perfect form and motivate each individual member
i then checked in and left a urine sample as requested and sat down among a crowded waiting area
i was of course upset and did call and leave a message expressing my disappointment and that i was a bit angry about it but it was a civil message even if i was clear that i would not pay the 50 that i felt it was a slap in the face and because of our financial situation i would have no choice but to go somewhere else if it wasnt resolved
i highly recommend this group
then 30 minutes in the room before the doctor checked her out
she always has a smile on her face and listens to details
the pa who i have been seeing for the past year left the practice
then theres dr i dont know who comes in and jacks around for a while dilates your eyes for no reason so you can be miserable all day and finishes with more i dont knows and then writes a prescription for you whether you needed one or not
you never know who you are going to see
i have been going to bella vista dental for several years now
you wont be dissappointed
ive been avoiding looking up for the past 12years because it was just uncomfortable
i used a groupon but their prices are really affordable anyways
do not trust this company
things have gone downhill here due to high turnover
i definitely recommend this dr wolfson
im a daily juicer and still had really bad stomach cramps the rest of the day
51117 still have so many areas on my face that are marked up like bruises
so i go out on to the patio because you cant smoke joints inside only vape the second i get outside i realise some old man is following me
this is the closest gym to me which is why i go but jesus is the place falling apart when it rains the roof leaks and instead of trying to fix it or clean it all youll see is a wet floor sign and dirty rags covering the pile
still no call
dr diaz is fabulous
i always shop at target  i cant stand wally world
i get a little paranoid about taking up so much time looking for glasses but joe made sure that im getting the right glasses for my face and prescription
i can tell you that i did not notice a difference at all
she takes so much time with her patients and is super receptive to my experience
eye exams on sundays
he directly said to me that he was too busy to take on my case
went to er after 24 hrs of horrid back pain
additionally i plan to pursue the food sensitivity testing offered as well
if you ask me bellair in general is the most trusted name in salon treatments and laser therapy no matter what location you go to
wish i came more often
and its easy to see why he compliments them because they were all great too
she tries to be as gentle as she can and told me to just raise my hand if i needed a break from the pain but the cleaning didnt hurt at all surprisingly
he asked about my early life and family and progressed to current work life and family
it seems like i see a smaller staff every time i come in
i love the environment music and the trainers
and to make matters worse there is are excuses and terrible attitude from some of the front desk staff
not forgetting the lovely shelly and barbara
she gave me her cell and always answered right away and was so good with me even when i was probably anxious about things
il garde mon oeil ouvert avec des espaces de btons je dois regarder une lumire mauve
i had such a stressful couple of weeks
better yet just stay away
i highly recommend him
im from out of town and was really struggling and fortunately i got real help there
the receptionists were really pleasant and helpful too
pearle is the place to go
michael is a great trainer who is also personable and willing to help anyone out with their fitness goals
i treated about three days a week with dr vuong
there was some small pain when the novocaine was administered but none when the tooth was extracted
i handed him the money and asked for change he jumped back in his cab and took off
ill go back again and again
she has helped me with numerous aches and pains throughout the years and has helped friends get pregnant
i have one messed up back
i can never get a hold of the billing department by phone
this recent visit elliot focused on my problem areas and i felt soooo good afterwards
dr gardener came in to check my teeth after my cleaning and he was great
per my insurance administrators recommendation i have sent payment for the amount due without interest
my back went out in july 2011 and i went to him to find out what was wrong
however it was a bit surprising that she did not do a full examination like checking his skin since often pediatric conditions can involve rashes
i find the owner and front desk personnel very nice and polite
some sessions will take longer bc of the nature of the treatment
as far as i know my boyfriend seems to really like him and how he gets things done with care and patience
i did the liquid gel full set coffin shaped and had an great experience
not necessarily a fan of going to the hospital but  i recently spent some time at the piper surgical center
highly recommendif i could give a zillion stars i would
excellent service and standard definitely less painful than other places i have been to in the past super clean  tidy facility
unfortunately after trying to work  with his pa for 6 weeks i still was not able to get the treatment dr darson  recommended
you get these ridiculously high bills week after week with no insurance claims submitted and then you cant reach their billing reps  i wrote 3 letters and made 5 different phone calls trying to reach these clowns and never got a reply or a person to speak with
super clean and professional office
the staff at the front desk was really nice to me and the pricing was incredibly reasonable
so what can i say
this facility has been too up and down with my care
very professional and friendly
the temperature is a perfect 105 degrees with 60 humidity
his program has changed my life
stayed here for a couple nights after surgery in may
such a pretty place excellent service
the shot hurt like a mothertrucket but apparently its expected
for me it was an 1100 dollar bill from another dentist to repair their mistake and months of them lieing to me and saying my teeth were fine
vickie is wonderful and the treatment awesome
it would be wise for a doctor to read up on a patiences file before the appointment so that they could avoid wasting time when the answer is already in the file
i havent been to the dentist in quite a while so when my wisdom tooth became an irritation i needed to get in somewhere and get it taken care of quickly
the day of our appointment  we arrived 20 minutes early as suggested to fill out paper work about problem areas what we were looking for ect
i went to several back doctors who went straight to surgery injections and heavy heavy meds
working in the medical field for over 25 years i know the signs to look for
it is hard to find a reputable dentist in vegas
the whole staff is amazing too
dr velasco was very knowledgeable and helpful with giving me advice for my eyes and what kind of contact lenses to try
she listened to my every word and even added techniques that i didnt pay for upfront which led to her getting a great tip
appropriate prescriptions  we were out of there
cant wait to have you do mine
he has no manners and doesnt know how to speak to people
the food was amazing and we were so spoiled by the end of the week that it was hard to go back to the old pbj lunches and frozen dinners
you get called back once to get vitals checked then you have to wait in the lobby again
making an appointment is easy and you can usually get the timeday you want
i found him to be dedicated and compassionate physician
however i didnt get that
i dont understand the need to come on yelp like so many people and bash a business like this that clearly has a bunch of individuals literally running their own little business is inside it as therapists
im doing this and he comes up to me trying to hurry me off asking me when ill be done etc
3 its not a fancy setup by any means
i saw them on groupon they had a special running for a 50min massage and an express facial which they honored the price there
the most important thing is that thedoctor has great skills and knows how to adjust to each patients individual needs
definitely made me feel more confident in fully understanding what happens to the body throughout labor and delivery
i do not even know where to begin
even when i have called and left messages i received a prompt and thorough response each time
i called your family physician and made an appointment with dr mia adriano who listened to my situation asked relevant questions and ran some tests to see what was going on
wont be going back their ever again
was able to speak to heather there and things worked out ok i feel like a bit of a spazz
its right down the street and much better choice
i warned him i would mess it up lol
disclaimer this comment does not reflect any practitioner services as that was not the reason for my visit
she is very friendly and a sweetheart
they usually have great deals on oreos and other random things like toothpaste at the same time
this was the worst of them all thus far
the associate who assisted me did not provide any help and acted as if i was bothering her when asking her a question
dr davis exudes warmth kindness and professionalism
he is conservative when you go under the knife he will do just enough and never more
this place is the best
dustin is awesome
still no phone call tonight so today im yelping to tell you all about it
they take a holistic approach and really spend the time helping their patients
ive been seeing dr ashley for over half a year and am so grateful for all shes done to keep my back and body aligned
would give zero stars if i could
would definitely recommend this clinic to friends and family
i have never written a review before in my life but this is how awful this place is
dr johnson dr hunter and dr holtzen are all amazing doctors that you cannot go wrong wity any of them
office appearancelobby spacious lobbyfront desk complimentary bottled water
im looking forward to continuing treatment to obtain a healthier and happier lifestyle
never felt rushed they answered all my questions
not only is their staff kind and professional they also pamper their customers
the front desk staff was fabulous and the hygienists always friendly
i highly recommend north valley eye care
you can tell he loves what he does
the staff and dr heinrich are beyond excellent
but at least the same can be said for their menswear too
a strange bubble had formed on my gumline one morning and even though it didnt hurt i was anxious that it was an abscess
dr taylor acted as if we were bothering him with her broken finger he wouldnt really let me get a word in edge wise he was to eager to get out of the room
they were very thorough and knowledgeable about the procedures and kept me very comfortable in the midst of my visit
this was my first time ever getting a facial of any kind so i was a little nervous
the pod could do with being slightly wider as my armsfingers tended to touch the sides
thanks again valley vascular surgeons
they went out of their way to squeeze me in four days later
also they are very rigid with their tardy policy
first he rubbed novocain on my gums so i wouldnt even feel him giving me the shots of novocain
this office wasted weeks of my time when i could have been receiving medical treatment elsewhere and is without a doubt the most unorganized doctors office i have ever been to
the office personnel is always friendly and welcomes you with a warm smile
since i started treatment we have experimented with different treatment options and found the one that worked best for me
so i gave barrow a call and they transferred me over to their referral line
but it is true
i came here to get laser on my under arms
my orthodontist told me 17 years ago that if anyone ever told me i needed my wisdom teeth removed because of crowding they were lieing to me
they were just extremely accommodating to my circumstances
i was always told to wait until next time it will work it is working etc
later that day the nurse called back and said she was returning my call
too bad the membership initial fee is 55 and only waved on your first visit
my son was taken back for cleaning and xrays
this is the second time this has happened
weve been taking our son to mesa peds for 11 months
i suffer from in growns on my big toes due to having to wear closed toed uncomfortable shoes for work however the gals here always make sure to take their time and get them out so i am pain free
she state yes we have completed one iui
marianne is a pleasure to work with and is always on top of billing and appointment reminders
i wish she was closer to me so i could still work with her
i love cloud nine
they are honest with you about wait times allow you to book over the phone and try to see you within 2448 hours of calling
couple that with how amazing she was with our son during his exam and i cant recommend her highly enough
she and her staff gossiped and discussed other staff members and their social lives while i was drowning in my own saliva with a giant machine stretching my mouth and my throat that was supposed to suction out all of the saliva
she went right to my left handtapped me a few times and before i knew it it was over
if you are looking for the best spa experience look no further
so i proceeded to schedule that appointment for the two fillings
thank you lvdg
i dont get sick often but when i do ill just wait until the next business day for my primary doctor to see me
i really like him a lot i will be back for sure if another minor medical emergency should crop up
if you care about your health avoid this place at all cost
so i was scared to eat raw frozen fresh oysters so i ordered one pound of king crab any my wife ordered calamari without cajin
i was very impressed with everyone there
when i called valley perinatal back to cancel todays meaningless appt i told a different receptionist about the mix up
he takes his time with all patience to explain the procedure
then when she saw the emotional state i was in omg are you alright
severe pain is rare but happens
i went to see paul for pregnancyrelated sciatic pain a couple weeks ago after trying several other treatments chiropractic stretches massage etc
i had a couples massage here over the weekend and although i enjoyed my company i was around it was still very difficult to relax and unwind due to the noise levels that came from the place next door
see you there
angelo is great and very knowledgeable about cryotherapy
so i scheduled the fillings and that was my biggest mistake thus far
best dentist in chandler
couldnt they tell me that on the phone
he is the first and only lmt that has truly helped me since my accident
didnt have to wait 30 min after my appointment to see the doc even though the place was full
second i believe i was pushed into treatment that was extreme and not an emergency
he was so friendly and had such a great personality
you can never get through to anybody and all you can do is leave a message and wait for a call back which can be up to 23 days
we are going to miss coming to see dr gary richardson when we move
cant wait to go back to try laser hair removal
plus they take most insurances
i think the kicker was when i asked about their hours they explicitly said they were really busy sundays but there was only one employee then so dont come
i made an appointment for 1145 and ended up leaving after i waited 3 hours
which just makes you want to come back all the time
a three minute procedure and 160
no paperwork on my part
jennifer is herself a wonderful warm presence  compassionate attentive professional and friendly
have been very happy with my treatments and really like the convenience of availability and location as well as results
my first experience i had not visited a dentist since i left the marine corps over four years ago
i have always had clear skin no acne an occasional blemish here or there
here  this is no donation they make well more than 1000 from every sizeable bottle of plasma you sell to them for money in the first place
they also close for an hour around lunch time
i highly recommend this place
not sure if its because they sell it in those tubes instead of sealed bags but either way its not cool to get bud that dry from a dispensary
i had my very first reiki energy session with anita and it was a great experience
in the end all you passengers complaining dont get a ride and discount cab does not get their dispatch fees either yea i know stupid
i had a fairly easy pregnancy thank you god
i cannot recommend highly enough
a massage from chad is better than a session of hot yoga a massage and a whole day at the spa put together
i am now going to get my dental work done there
i call back 3 days later after not hearing anything back and kristen offers me aromatherapy after a 10 minute conversation without once displaying any issues with what happened or trying to make this right
my massage therapist heather is amazing
i was at sometimes left alone in my room for 30 minutes at a time till someone else came in to finish my facial or massage
she again confirmed my medical and surgical history and led me to the machine
i would have to say their equipment is really new and has all the bells in whistles
i almost never get narcotics except for the broken ankle so i would be able to get my scripts right there if they still had it
shame on this doctor for bringing his own misfortune to the table in front of patients in pain  distress
dr hales is one of the best
i am considered a tattoo collector and have work from some of the most renowned names in the industry from some of the world famous shops particularly from los angeles
i left a very detailed message about me just wanting my lab results back
clearing negative energy
front desk as well every part of the experience was perfect
she laughed with me and told me some funny jokes
what a great experience i had the office is very clean and inviting doctor and staff  were very nice an informative and professional
when we told her which one she said that they dont accept it for the actual glasses
it was a very relaxing experience
got a problem
i just got a massage today
im a good neutral rating on this one
dr fleming made my first night guard 15 years ago after some dedicated time toward wearing braces
2 how much pressure do you prefer
i liked her a lot
this is a wedding and people come from all over the world to be here and you are saying they cant take pictures of each other
anytime someone asks me about this place i tell them dont waste your time because theyre probably the worst company ever created with no standards and poor customer service
i can see like an eagle
so if your employer sends you here for a drug test  fear not the place seemed to be clean and you will survive it
have had to go back multiple times to get a refund
after my 3rd visit i havent been back and am currently switching to a new obgyn
the actual root canal only took about an hour and fifteen minutes
i did not have dental insurance yet the costs were very reasonable
dr weingarten became my doctor to handle my sudden hearing loss physician about 6 months ago
it was actually a joke
we went on a sunday and it was not crowded
found out the doctor was going to be late
manette is awesome
the test took all of about 5 minutes and is really easy i only got 1 wrong you take a quick picture and boom you are all set to go
she put me at ease right away
i love this office
i highly recommend checking this place out
very clean nice place
12 weeks later the injection site was still hurting and i developed a loss of pigmentation along the top of the foot
they often have a core section consisting of crunches or leg lifts
from the front desk staff hygienists to dr davis everyone is warm fun and attentive
ive been going to eyetech for the last 15 years
i have tmj issues and after having a cavity replaced by dr barnes for the first time ever i had no jaw pain after the procedure
superior staff and store
that has been compromised how and why the injury occurred
i asked her to charge the card i had on file and to please get the meds sent out
bay dentals operational hours are fantastic
everyone else sucks
i believe this is a new location first of all
as with any foot reflexology place its always a hit or a miss with your massage
definitely going back for bigger tattoos
several concerns were being worked on already
happy yelping phoenix
we were  trying to give this place another chance but her stuff is making it impossible
dr trupin is flighty
is it too much to expect professional service with a satisfactory end result
ive never had trouble booking appointments or being seen and ive never waited more than 20 minutes in the waiting room which is a miracle for an obgyni remember sitting for hours with my old doctor
the girl at the front was not friendly or happy she called me up multiple times for stuff that i could have quickly done after i signed in
when i walked in the room and sat down he followed me in and proudly said i can give you better than 2020 vision he looked at my eyes and then started to go through the clarification through the imachine with the eye chart on the wall
i had another visit here today
everyone here makes you feel comfortable and will help you with any concern or question you have
they can keep my 300 they apparently need it more than i do to keep their unworthy doors open for business
still   id make sure i give the person a courtesy call to let them know theyre not forgotten
she finally decided that it was enough and left
pity the store is a distance from my home but i happily make the drive at least once or twice a month
im not even sure why i filled out the health form she didnt even read it
i have had a few so i know the difference
ive been a member of me for two years and been to a few locations around the valley and have been to at least ten different therapists before i finally found the best angela
it provides the service of doctors and nurses to students and residents alike
they made us wait in the pedicure room
i asked what time it was she said 125 i said my appointment was at 110 thats not more than 15 minutes
time is more important to me than have a private room for a simple spinal adjustment
once someone walked away and she said shes tired of people asking questions
they are awesome
they didnt do a test spot and never even checked to see if i was a good candidate
wait time bad staff whatever little thing may stop you from coming here i would reconsider
the doc a tall short hair gentleman was professional and courteous
in my opinion its quite a racket walgreens has going  practitioners onsite to overprescribe medications that they will happily fill
yes a fictional hospital would be more help than this place
i find it very easy to overlook the little noises because the massage is so relaxing
just to update and be fair the owner did contact me to resolve the issue he was very apologetic and sincere
everywhere else ive been before they ask you  how is the pressure well not here
ive had experience with acupuncture in the past
this is the best urgent care i have ever been to
great place to go for glasses
angel goes above and beyond for her clients displaying an intense passion for her chosen career
you see that in all that they do
they really should have thought about the room placements better ie dont put massage rooms next to break rooms
love this place
we called for physical therapy for my son and had the doctor fax over the necessary documents quickly
the ambiance is good with a lot  of natural light air conditioning and 70s rock music
i had talked with a salesperson named  shelly to find out the difference between plan f high deductible and regular plan f and regular plan g other than the 2180 deductible
im glad umc closed at 4pm so i could find this place
a pain filled week later after waiting the seemingly customary 45 minutes i told him i wanted another brand
after several years of seeing my chiropractor whom i thought was fantastic i was told my insurance was no longer accepted
ive visited several chiropractors in the past and she by far has the best bedside manor
i literally told her my order 45 times and it still didnt sink in
id absolutely shop at this store again the staff was pleasant and helpful the service was efficient and the products are of excellent quality and fairly priced
will never return
thats the worst
i wouldnt recommend anyone else
i also witnessed a richard use a to well on which he had sprayed the ad pray they use to wipe down the equipment when he was touching another patient
you definitely want someone who knows what they are doing with this procedure and she definitely knows what shes doing
i get regular monthly massages and teresa found spots my therapist has never found and my gal is good
everyone from the er to the floor that my daughter stayed on was attentive compassionate and very professional
she even helped adjust the fitting for my mother
i am happy i found this place
which i noticed on the credit card slip before i signed itthey should have mentioned it before the card was processed
when i called no one at this practice could help me and the receptionist didnt even direct me to a billing person
dr john has been a lifesaver for me
last week i canceled my basic cleaning with artisan dental and told them the story i have written above
best er care around
this is not a universal understanding again not all locations do this
i told them i would pay for the current office visit
i just found her very rude and not someone i can trust my mess with
so maybe to  jo could contact corporate directly and express their concerns to see what changes can take place
getting my teeth cleaned by wendy is an absolute joy dealing with payments with tracie is easy and efficient and all of the assistants particularly janice are sweet and kind and take an interest in me personally
if only they cared as much about their patients and customer service as did about getting their money
they have a very poor attitude and i am appalled at their poor customer service
she is kind funny informative and overall very compassionate
dr docasar is amazing
i was told that dr geronimo was not comfortable pulling the tooth that i need an oral surgeon which is b does regular dentist can pull teeth any
you only have so much time with your dog or cat  make it count
while i know that isnt always the case with dealredeeming patrons please take this into consideration when scheduling your discount voucher clients
i was a bit skeptical going into to kiss to get eyelash extensions
the desk woman was unfriendly and rude to me and cold to  everyone she dealt with
ive never had a cavity or any other problems with my teeth so i waited for my next appt with a different dentist
my son had 3 visits in oct 2016 he wasnt impressed the first time but gave it two more chances
while we did not have an appointment we noticed that those people who had appointments came and went fairly quickly
love all the staff
i have recommended his office to several of my friends and will continue to do so to anyone who asks
great price and am feeling so much better
but if anything beyond checking up needs to be done and if your child is anxious or nervous he will not tolerate it or do anything to help your child calm down
i always have had bad experiences with obgyns and i change doctors yearly because i feel uncomfortable with them given the fact that it is an uncomfortable situation already
however she backed her employee this i find both good and bad actually
i i felt taken advantage of
i wasnt trying to take advantage or run the show
much different experience
not only is she an amazing deep tissue masseuse she combines reiki and reflexology for a full healing experience
if you are a new patient dont bother
well since no one told me to fast i did not
i went in this afternoon with every intention of canceling my membership brittany offered a sincere apology for what had happened and offered to make it up to me
the police are always outside
i had a groupon for reflexology and my therapist was susan
unlike other doctors who rush me through  my problems he takes the time with me and my famiky and makes sure that all my questions  are answered
i walked up and asked about the add ons they offer foot scrub etc
as a new patient i was nervous how ever when i got there the front office ladies were very friendly and the dr spent about 30 min with me
my wife got her braces put on here and i recently went with her to one of her adjustment appointments
the wait is at least a quarter of what the other places in that area are open til
the office is nice and clean
love this place
this is really bad business practices
truly amazing experience
isnt that your business
ive tried bikram yoga before so i decided to purchase the latest one month at 49 groupon for the tempe studio
at this time i also set an appointment with the on staff gynecologist at a later date for my yearly exam
when apria called me they did not ask what equipment i had or needed
my head was spinning going from one room to another not even knowing what they were doing
she is extremely knowledgeable professional and talented
later than night i got a call from dr twesme just to see how i was
from the front desk staff to the xray technician to the dentist today oral hygienist everyone was kind gentle patient and professional
love love love linda
sure come on in was the response
they got me in immediately were extremely gentle which was a huge concern due to previous experiences where i would need to be sedated
i spent a full hour trying to get through but couldnt
when we walked in the room they had the restraining device that had a plastic body mold with velcro that would hold the arms and legs down
4 not knowing or hiding the success rate for their implants
my daughter insisted i needed a microdermabrasion
they talk in spanish so easy for me to understand
he really listened to what i was telling him about my past history and explained his recommendations in an easy to understand manor
i just started going here i was in real pain and had 3 molars pulled
i know that some people really love dr wilson
he does poke number two
since im a thrifty asian at times haha
i feel absolutely amazing everytime i leave
staff  some of the staff were pretty friendly
i was discharged as i was not bleeding enough and that it didnt matter that i had surgery 9 days before and that it appeared there was separation at the surgical site
this review comes three months after my last appointment with them but i want everyone to understand how awesome dr telega and janine are
hes so nice and friendly and asked me all sorts of questions to get to know me
i would highly recommend dr halmi
staff is rude aggressive and uncaring
i was then lead into the product area by rodrigo r who right away was very friendly
one room is dedicated to the reformers and another for trx
my partial with three teeth look great
i had said i was really busy to come this month and never go exactly to the year  but would get them checked in the fall
i did not exaggerate anything though i fully admit my use of humor undermines the seriousness of my observations
and between our medical 3some were all on the same page to tackling what other doctors have either a ignored or b tried to tell me was just depression
the floor was filthy and im big on cleanliness so when i looked behind couches and still see dirt i get concerned about the places hygiene
edit i visited my friend n the 5th floor because he had a firework accident and this was the story he told me in short  they were launching fireworks and drinking right away i think bad idea
she will always be an addict but is trying to do the right thing
the phlebotomist walked out and was talking on a cordless phone about her personal business
i cant say enough good things about this team
this place is really a busy location
besides she tried to get rid of an acne on my back with her nails i dont understand
thats when he told me he was my dr
i gotta say i was very impressed with this personal outreach
i recommend anyone who needs specialized care to go see dr zedek
seriously this staff makes me feel right at home
he was able to save my tooth even though it was pretty tricky
their office is conveniently located comfortable and clean
great conversationalist and funny eased my mind from what was going on with my baby girl
one women was asleep
i love her
no hesitation recommending him
i will be coming back here every time i come back to town
i recommend vivacity
i felt listened to by dr jeffy and her assistant diana
i have gone here for the last 3 years and i must say that i am very pleased
one just acknowledged it then called me out several times to get into the poses ones recommended to avoid at all costs
i figured i could take them to the childrens dentist next door if they needed any fillings neither of my children have had any before
i was prepared emotionally if not financially to drop a couple thousand into my sons mouth over the phone
my only complaint
you will have to ask for everything and confirm every detail
his name is grayson and hes great for deep tissue massage
the reason ive been coming to her is the good referrals ive heard about her
the smoothie bar is clutch when youre in need of anything that you forgot or just have to have
i hope i never have to go to an er again but if i do def i would come back to this hospital
i highly recommend that if you are in need of chiropractic services go to global chiropractic
she doesnt speak english very well but he was really patient and kind to her as she explained her issues to him
the office staff is very professional and so willing to accommodate your needs
i will say that cvc does a great job at confirming appointments
very disappointed with this place and would definitely not recommend mmend nor return
dr barefoot and his team are wonderful
she literally hid her name tag behind her clip board refused to tell me and said i have no manager
cried myself to sleep sunday evening and at 8am sharp called the first  on my list of dentists
if you do find a good doctor at main campus you have to ask yourself is parking and a high volume of people and lack of communication worth it
thank you highly recommend people to see him
horrible office practices beyond belief
if this were a medical emergency with equivalent pain i think it would be barbaric to send someone away under these conditions and i have to wonder about the lack of communication
but remember this its way more expensive to have surgery or be in perpetual pain
she keeps you busy with a lot of different routines and so you never really get a chance to grow tired of the workouts she has you do
if anyone could recommend a neurologist that could actually help please let me know
i know its a minor thing but you dont see customer service like that anymore
the joint gives you individual results all for one low price and fast service while still being thorough
i have sensitive teeth and they were extra careful
people there look happy when they left
it was a great deal and i will likely be back once a month for a massage and detox
i just thought its a rip off
brittany explained everything she was doing and she is very knowledgeable
i bought a 60 minute massage from goupon to use at my bliss
went in 5 days after giving birth to my 2nd daughter due to a sciatic nerve and my first session i already felt relief
whats more getting a bill settled is a herculean process involving multiple calls emails and faxes
the day of surgery makenzie morgan and charles helped to put me at ease and make sure i was comfortable
not too shabby
shaka meter   uuu   uuu   uuu   uuu   uuu  5
skin city is the best
i was extremely impressed with him and his staff
well duh i figured that i was looking for more of a pound estimation  save yourself the headache staff is incompetent drs dont take time with you just rush you in an out and its all about money with them
not screening w ultrasound prn if needed as ordered by my doctor but diagnostic both sides
he works very carefully with all his patients
i have a very detailed review regarding my experience with dr hunt and her staff on google and angies list however i am limited on my space so i will only tell the basics
so good in fact ill not go to any old place for a massage againher prices are extremely fair for the quality and value of the service received
so ill want to tell what the something special is that dr dhulab and idlewild dentistry did for me i had multiple dental problems that dr dhulab took care of
i joined about 2 months ago and have had an absolute blast
doctor came out said they would see me
long story short i have carpal tunnel came here because i was experiencing numbness in my hands and this quack told me i may have diabetes then was about to have me getting brain scans wow
waited 3 hours before my 2 children were seen
i was not informed that dr puhek is apparently planning to retire and is no longer in the office for the past couple of months because of a recent family incident
he is so well respected in the valley and has delivered over 10000 babies in his career
had to find a new dentist as i moved from scottsdale to central phoenix
i get hurt a lot
they were helpful and friendly
after 5 adjustment with the impulse iq technology 4 acupuncture treatments 4 massage sessions and 3 times on the decompression table the constant pain was gone
just got back from my first appointment at this planned parenthood and couldnt wait to write this review
that 100 i spent only paid to get the digital images not only did i spend way too much money i had to get them printed out somewhere else just to get prints for cards
she is a wonderful person and very easy to talk to
my coworkers thought i started wearing makeup
dont waste your time
i will definitely be bringing my wife back in a few months to get her lasik done
dr cherukuri was my specialist and i have not met a doctor who was so humble and kind in a very long time
i went in a third time to get the filling on my tooth because thats what i wanted i called ahead of time to confirm the price and was told it would be 60
i wrote two letters to the manager of the clinic and never heard anything back
hes the real deal
cant wait to return and take my mother in law
all of the staff i interacted with were great except the pa she was very rude and judgemental of how i broke my foot
two small gripes aside this is definitely a dentist worth seeing if you happening to live in this part of town
be very honest and specific about what you want to achieve and he will provide you with the result you are looking for
no point for me to bitch about her in here go to other place guys
he was able to fit in a half hour appointment that day which i happily took
ive never had a better experience with a hospital
rule number one for me when visiting a new doctor is to watch the staff
dr jordan kim and her other dedicated staff members have treated me like a family member since day 1  i feel like a friend more than a patient at this office
i am not one to write reviews let alone on a dentist but dr ostler and his staff are amazing
small tip krispy kreme ive been waiting for over an hour already do you honestly think im willing to wait even longer
i said i was hoping for blue like mine her reply at least shes not mexican
i would recommend quan highly for all kinds of body pain issues
that all changed when i walked into vip plastic surgery
i continue to have terrible experiences with service ontario
maybe im weird but i dont like hanging out in the front waiting room or their separate waiting area when ive got a hospital gown on that opens in the back if there are strange men walking around and staring at me
postsurgery youll have his email in case issues arise so you can email him and he answers pretty darn quick
she tells me that i have cavities and several cracked teeth that need crowns
i honestly do not understand why this place is rated so high
once i called to set up an appointment they immediately gave me trouble for the groupon appointment request
it felt like id inhaled fiberglass into my throat
it was just word and very hostile
he spends a lot of time with his patients and listens
i urge you to continue searching for a different office preferably one with a higher yelp rating
i do highly recommend suzi to anyone who would like to give physic medium a try
my son and i both had appointments and we were there for over three hours
she is a wonderful and a first rate professional
very helpful and friendly
i went to several doctors and nothing could be pinpointed
and you were really rude to me about it as well
she told me it was a bite and gave me a different rx for an allergic reaction which did the trick
the trainers are so great at explaining the technical aspect to beginners
she listened to my needs and was extremely sweet
i live a half mile from this hospital but will never go there again for any reason
when i realized what she was scraping i freaked out and told her to stop taking it off because now i can feel the wire
we have purchased more than 10 pairs of glasses and prescription lenses for my cycling glasses and contact lenses
i love the friendly  atmosphere and individual way to workout
i had a bad experience with the former doctor in this same office
well the doc that rocks did exactly what he said he was going to do and i had my first good experience at the dentist
otherwise she would have had no idea
after spending the day going back and forth with the doctors office and desert radiologist i still had no appointment
do not go there
they have moved to pecos and wigwam
they really try to sell you on becoming a member when you are checking out which i do not like
do yourself a favor and give her a try
yes i go to almost all targets in scottsdaledesert ridge area
literally the best chiropractic experience ive ever had
no return call and here i am 20 min after my check in time not waiting to be seen but told i cant be seen because i didnt physically possess an insurance card even though my insurance was verified
what a great place to go for eye care
as for quality of care  up until recently i blamed my kid for all the problems with wires and brackets because she isnt as careful as she could be
he is dedicated compassionate and encouraging
i am loving how things are shaping off of me
time to hunker down and get real seriouslike
erin was recommended by a friend whose skin has greatly improved since seeing her
but dr jensen made me feel at ease knowing that she will have the proper sedation doses and had a talked to me one on one in regards to the whole procedure
i would recommend tropicana west chiropractic to anyone
havent been to the dentist in too many years
do you let your groceries at the door while you go get your car then park it at the front
when she finally got into a room her labor nurse was extremely rude to me
intersection coming from uptown area and take the next right into the complex2630 building is all the way in the back
i went in for a lung infection
let me first say i hate dentists in general
i look and feel great
he knows the body so well
on the way out he said we should see pediatrician if not gone in a few days
if your staff cant be trained then fire them and replace them with people who understand how a business works
long wait times incompetent receptionists and horrible physical therapy
she is an excellent listener
dr pritz is the best
i highly recommend highland creek chiropractic  acupuncture
courtney is amazing
12 classes and i swear i saw abs
he mad sure my dad understood the treatment and was comfortable
most of the time spent appropriately on the feet
i was referred to zoey from a friend of mine and i am so glad i was
this experience was at my pace and very caring
i had 3 big tattoos that i got done in barrie from one artist and all of them heal without scarring and without the use of h2o
the bridges look fantastic
i went to the new location on 24th
i feel the most comfortable in the hands of professionals who are open and honest about results
joking about why another person gets paid more than them
pure and utter excellence
would you take this response
everyone is so friendly and always there to answer any questions that i have
ijust have to say this is the best dental experience ive had since moving out here
i didnt ask for that and its a small detail but it really made me happy
it felt as if the staff was pushing patients away due to the timing of arrival with some patients
i cringe when i see r replacing are i dont ever ever support these businesses even babies r us unless i have a gift card or someone i know is registered there
dr kwan really listens to all your concerns and treats your whole body rather than just one part of your body like most traditional doctors do
innovative eye care and dr michelle mumford are the most amazing eye care team i ever been to
it is a division of nygh and according to the website as long as your injurysituation is not life threatening or extremely serious they advise you to go to this location to alleviate wait times at the main hospital location
having a personal trainer take such an interest in my personal well being and personal growth is one of the best things to ever happen to me
usually whenever i have gone into the er it has taken me 68 hours to get out
they really liked their experience
i recently had a thai massage here and even though i wasnt quit sure what to expect it was incredible
starting this off i am no doctor
day surgery for basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid terrified me
she cares about her business but more importantly her customers
that was completely rude
for 700 you to give me a half of bowl i dont think so and to top it off i got ready to tip because i also have a customer service job before i could say thank you the smart ass said your welcome anyway what a punk i took my tip back and told him they all need to be more professional because this is the 3rd time with bad service at this store
great friendly service and affordable too
i rarely post however i thought i needed to take the time to write what an absolutely amazing dental office this is
really professional super attentive and so nice
it is comfortable
the dr seemed inconvenienced by my request for specific lenses and seemed pushy about a particular brand most likely because she gets a kick back
amazing her call center training
after all this they release me and i literally vomited in the parking lot for a good 10 minutes because they had me all day with no food and then gave me a mixture of 5 different types of medicine
hoping i will get the same excellent care that i had a couple years ago
five minutes later your already heading home
would highly recommend southtown dental care
i had to wait an hour after my schedule appt time but it was just one of days
after applying the trays and extra cotton lip protection as well as explaining how to not injure myself with the led light they left me alone and came back to check up on me periodically during my 40 minute stay
unfortunately i got scheduled an emergency work meeting during my appointment and had to cancel but the phones closes at 4pm even though the office closes at 5pm so i had to wait until the morning of my apt monday to cancel
without the endearment this time whereupon i replied my arm again
i had some mixed experiences with dentists in other states so i was expecting to have to go to a few dentists before i found one that offered good comfortable service with good prices
i have had wonderful experiences with everyone at this office and i havent been this happy about the way my skin looks in a very very long time
i told him not to work on one of my specific body parts because it was previously injured which he tried to work on anyway but then stopped because i didnt feel it felt right still since it wasnt fully healed
during cleaning i was told that i must get some fillings and other deep cleaning procedures 800
first i want to start off this review by i am extremely selective of the doctors treating my son
the office is a complete mess
the doctor was great and addressed all my concerns
furthermore we had talked about how i am a grad student so i thought he might be willing to throw a bone to the pregnant student
again first one in the waiting room and i wait 30 minutes past my appointment time
very little waiting around
i cant thank him enough
my favorite wrap is probably the tuna and spirit wrap
hes very knowledgeable in his massage techniques and in muscle release
my invisalign treatment surpassed my expectations
my husband had kaywa tonight and said his technique was very good
der schwerpunkt scheint bei dieser apotheke aus meiner sicht eher im wellnessbereich zu liegen
i have been using this office for years and it has been going downhill for the last two
they even have a keurig for coffee while you wait
if my insurance would accept any other urgent care id go in a heartbeat
love my lips
dr ahn  dr perez are fabulous
staff is amazing
the selection is great with lots of fashion forward options
their fried dumpling gyoza were delicious and meat had good spices
my massag therapist recently moved so o was in hopes to find a new one and this place definitely failed
in frustration she went to this office looking for help
the procedure is fast
this dentist and his office manager have the worst customer service skills
dr methani explained in detail after the cleaning and checks everything that was going on good and bad
the office was really clean and the staff was so friendly
donna is a godsend
i have been donating whole blood since 2007 over time there had been occasional problems such as couple of tries to get the needle into the vein properly and maybe 15 to 20 minutes wait even with an appointment
today my daughters regular rmt stacey grigsby was unavailable
my kids favorite is that they get to play the claw game until they win
they have always taken great care of me
i was anxious at first however i knew in reality i was in excellent hands
any issue i have had the nurse mary calls me back the same day and always handles things for me
one office staff told me that doctors run over all the time so its normal
d 5 stars
reluctant  because i would need to ditch work fly out here i hate flying and entertain myself while he was trainingwhy would i stay in chandler az
he is a caring warm individual and has always been in tune to physical needs and ailments
small update  they sent me a letter addressed to my first name and my exwifes last name
i seen dr elliot and he talked me through a new diet plan and what to expect over the next few weeks
she also has a very keen eye and ensures each patient will walk away with the most beautiful smile
cant say enough good things about her and i will definitely continue to see her
he knows his stuff and plays hockey too
dr swenson and his staff were great
great job  star
ive had more gains in 7 months than i did the previous 15 yrs
perhaps its the friendly smiles you see around every corner
had the doctor listened to my symptoms and actually examined my foot i think the misdiagnosis could have been avoided and i could have started the appropriate healing process 8 weeks sooner
he has family members with autoimmune so here is an outstanding medical doctor with first hand experience with autoimmune situations
who wants to take a trek when they are sick right
i thought that was remarkable for 5 days of therapy but apparently case management did not
consulted with and b
everyone was very professional and thoroughly explained everything
wisdom teeth extraction fast recovery minimal swelling minimal to no pain
thank you for realizing sick kids are miserable and helping to be part of the solution instead of a dreaded necessity to their health
i am so thankful for them
i understand you wanting to get home but you are a childrens urgent care you should have sympathy for a sick child and the parent or at least adjust your hours to say 630 the receptionist was extraordinarily rude and now my only resort is to go to an emergency room
i dare them to try and bring me back into this office
we arrived for the appointment on january 30 on time and the waiting room was crazy
then the unthinkable happened
1 hour would be too short and would leave you wanting more
our experience was perfect
since i didnt understand the results i immediately called presidio back and asked if they received the results the lady didnt even hesitate to say no
he truly cares about his patients and wants to do what is right for their body and their healing process
i love getting the first morning appointment
d after 15 years of having orthodontic treatment i had my braces taken off i was told two years and couldnt be happier with my smile
to the road to see if its clear enough to exit safely you know without being hit
i am writing this review under my husband
if there is a dental emergency she and dr pham make sure it is addressed and do everything within their power to make the patient comfortable
i finally left because i could no longer tolerate his office manager
dont hesitate to make an appointment you wont be sorry
i hear the owner however is only available during the day during the week which is too bad
her patients seem to thrive
the store is very pretty with a large selection of name brand and designer glassesenough to meet anyones style
kristen his optician was wonderful as well
her therapy room smells amazing
and most important he never makes you wait
ive been extremely pleased
i was very impressed with the reputation that tempe modern dentistry had and i called to make my appointment
since our first visit she has been very welcoming and has taken excellent care of our baby
i like that they have hospital gadgets like ultrasound and doppler to gauge the health of mom and baby but they also have the personalized carehomey ambiance you can receive from home birth by midwife
the nurses were amazing and all over me because they had a lull in their surgeries
0 post op pain
dr liang is a perfectionist at heart and a fantastic surgeon
sylvia did a great job and took extra care to accommodate a healing knee injury
although it was an experience getting here this was a flawless experience once i finally arrived
my wife is now also a patient of his
what a waste of his time and mine for calling for the appointment
this place is clearly bottom of the barrel i get that but the scam of taking money and not wanting to return it is unacceptable
it hasnt been cleaned in months
i never once felt rushed or unimportant
das macht mein allgemeiner hausarzt um einiges grndlicher und nimmt dafr einiges weniger also ich war zum ersten und zum letzten mal dort
i will never come back and im telling all my friends what happened
i have already gone back tonight for another facial in hopes to maintain my clearing healthier skin
i have always had a nurse or doctor do that after telling them which areas need what
together these actions result in a comprehensive full body treatment that relieves muscular tension improves circulation boosts the immune system and balances the body energetically
after 1 treatment i see a small change  it maybe to soon to tell or maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me but anywho even if its a small change ill take it
the schools health center was unable to do anything to help me besides giving me tylenol with codine and telling me to eat some chicken soup
i love that you are always seen on time and he never is condescending when questions are asked
never had a bad experience with desert shores
my wife has been seeing him for a few sessions and she recommended i see him for the long list of problems that ive been having
alicia richey my masseuse arrived promptly at 2pm to take me to the room
im never going there again
the instructors are very nice and knowledgeable
this manager promised me she would issue a refund immediatelyi gave her a full week and still no refund
so i get the referral in the mail and i call the office that they referred me to they dont take my insurance
i would not recommend going here
i am definitely going to be staying here and working to get my teeth in a wholesome and healthier place
i tasted their ramen but it was too odd
in some cases serving more needs than what you would expect from a pain management clinic
since starting acupuncture i have more energy and many of the problems i initially came in to address are no longer an issue
im assuming they are growing too fast and cant keep up or their reception desk is understaffed
im not going to go back and pay another 20 copay
fast forward to today
be very skeptical of this establishment if you get your teeth cleaned here
the atmosphere is quiet and comfortable
the only caveat is that they really only specialize in thicker acetate frames
which was often due to the amount of money spent
and referred me to periodontics limited
even though my favorite practitioner left see above and previous review i decided to give this place another try and opted to see another provider after a rude scheduling with a receptionist whom i never spoke with before and didnt see her at my appointment
there is a bit of a wait but it is worth it because she takes her time with you
also after the needle he comes in and looks at her toe and says he cant cauterize because its infected
what a waste of money
i feel my concern was taken seriously and i was treated quickly and with care and concern
never agin will we visit this location
if you prefer processed foods and the typical american diet dont bother
not impressed with the 3rd floor at all
bottom line they do not care about their patients whether their patients live or die all they seem to care about is if they get the insurance money in my opinion
heres why i can smell your nasty bare feet the room is bright i can hear people outside yelling the front desk girls chatting the people in the office space next to you answering phones you wont stop asking me questions and oh by the way your stomach is making the most absurd gurgling noises ive ever heard in my life
ive done enough fad diets that i feel i have a pretty good understanding of calorie deficits how my body burns etc
breaking it down its the dentist
he does great work
i recently had the same tooth start aching really bad causing me to almost throw up
and when dr holeman stopped taking new pregnancy patients i absolutely loved dr castro
i go for relaxation swedish massages have had one yoga injury and the massage worked it out quite well
and it gets better every time
she said yes but that it was not an easy 5 min thing that she could figure out and fix right then and she has a patient coming in 5 mins
then she stated that they only do an exam and xray on the first visit and you have to come back for cleaning
if you never buy anything else in life ever againbuy the spray toner
cheap and compassionate i recommend this place to others
every instructor brings something unique  all are awesome and know their stuff
then i went into the bathroom and emptied the remaining water from my body
it was firm which is fine but also brusque mechanical haphazard
i came across this place to fulfill my acai bowl needs
allysons knowledge and humility struck me immediately
we always refer our clients to him
picosure is amazing
i had never had a cavity in my lifebut when i first moved to az unaware of the good vs bad dentists in town i tried this place out
to talk to someone it pretty much needs to be your physician during business hours on a day they are at the office when they are done seeing patients and then you have to hope they get the message to call you
we had a great experience there today
well then someone on the patient side told us about dr sheikh when our daughter was 11 months old and 11 lbs
i will definitely be back again
dr wareing is an amazing doctor and delivered both of my children
in fact i would really like to get a refund for my office visit of 100
i was with them for about 2 months with this one gal who swore she new everything yet also did nothing even though she actually asked about the white count
my experience was very different looks like theyve turned things around
i also took my son he was 6 there and what a joke
i am disappointed in myself for staying with this office for as long as i did
this was actually my first visit to the dentist in 10 years and no cavities
the hygienists are friendly and efficient
ive also done a laser pixel treatment with dr viscomi who was awesome and i loved the results
i read reviews on him and decided to give him a shot
after visiting doctor dahlia wachs office and not receiving an itemized bill for payment i contacted the office several times requesting the bill be mailed to me so i could pay my portion of the owed amount
the staff is friendly knowledgable and helpful
dr price was my last resort but she was amazing
4 people who arrived after me was called before me
ive never seen this security phenomenon for ipod chargers anywhere else mind you
love this place
you know that motion when you hold the ends of a dirty towel and wave it like its a flag so that the dirt flies out
the thing is other solutions would have made the situation better
my 88 year old mother had problems swallowing foods
my personal nickname for her is glamour girl as she is always dressed to the nines
the time i waited was not bad for an er
the dentist was friendly and thorough
i demanded he leave as i was not about to let that jerk exam me for anything
the office is very clean there are always many staff members up front to assist you and theyre very friendly
none of this you have to wait a month before you can come back in
teresa was wonderful
my husband and i will definitely hire her again with our next baby
so 2 weeks later i stop in on a friday afternoon to simply see about making an appointment or to find out how there walk in service works
from walking in the door for my consult to being shown how it works and testing to see if im a candidate i had a great experience
everyone is helpful  my teeth are in their best health in a very long time
best thing is the wait was maybe about 10 minutes tops
ive just started personal training with a staff member here as well and i cant wait to see what my after photo looks like
hubby has some pain so we scheduled him in a few days time
i cant say enough about the facility thats always clean and the employees who always make us feel like we are part of the family
best dentist office ive been to in a long time
after i left i called my insurance to verify what my insurance copay was
ive been to dr isaac twice now and its a great experience
i wish i could still go to him for my appointments
expect a long wait up to 45 to 50 min in the waiting area after signing in every time
drquinn and kelley worked with me for the duration of year i was doing little by little procedures since im a student budget and now i cant stop smiling
kelsey if youre reading this i totally forgot to tip you
so we changed a few things at home and bought a pricey 20 cream at whole foods instead and happy to say its helping
i dont know if i can say enough good things about dr cohen and his lovely and beautiful staff
if youre looking for a dentist in town definitely go to town  country dental
i drive all the way from henderson to go to the west charelston location
the first problem i had with them was when i had an appointment for a two hour session i called to cancel because i had an emergency to attend to
i was going to travel abroad in one week when i went to the first doctor so if she had given me my antibiotic i have been much better by the time i travelled
i would never go anywhere else
this pleased my ego
it sounds like a scam to get more money from insurance companies
ive referred many to heritage dentistry and would encourage anyone reading this review to try for themselves this well run business
18 hours into induction when i lost my ability to cope with the pain ashley appeared like an angel and helped me with breathing through for as long as i could
gee thanks for the help
if not theyll let you bleed out to death they could care less run away
they could never give me an answer to my progress or anything
dr salevitz spoke to me not as a doctor but as a parent
i am pregnant now and due next year
she said she could only go back to 2014 but i told her i had brought my previous records from my doctor on the east coast
he certainly has a network of specialists to recommend if necessary but he has the resources available in his office to accomplish thorough exams and provide treatment plans and follow through with them
her knowledge and skill in her field was comforting assuring me i was in good hands
jim has worked with me for quite some time and i can honestly say he gets results
they have tons of gel colors to choose from they also have matching regular polish for toes and my nails turned out beautiful
dr george carr and his staff made me feel welcome the moment i walked in
the lady on the phone said if the doctor finds it necessary yes
then wait to be escorted in to a changinglocker room where you change into this xxxl hospital gown and stow away your belongings before being directed to one of the siemens mri machines to do your mri scan
their office in gilbert is extremely clean and very accessible
feeling top notch since my visit yesterday
a fair amount of time during my first appointment was spent waiting to be seen
there are no testimonials or even employee qualifications listed on their website
went to her for bioidentical hormones to treat my menopause after getting a hysterectomy
he is the rudest person you will meet this week probably this month and thats so long as you dont meet anyone for the rest of the year
he will also tell you his opinion and give you the facts and his recommendations and has the knowledge to back them up
i will be back and since i work down the road i have already started referring my coworkers
i was worried that i might be getting a gum infection and told her i was in some pain
pa is physicians asst which is a nurse with some advanced training  licensing
dr kwan is extremely thorough in her approach
even so they attempted to sell this to me again at the front desk and again in a separate enclosed room where i wanted to discuss cost of fillers
said they were too busy and that they dont take kids under 8 said i should go to emergency
first there are no outside pictures allowed
she then redirected me to a clinic that can do her job better than her
once she left i should have too
and yet spent about 30 minutes with the doctor 15 min picking out contacts and another 2 hours of waiting to get contact order submitted price estimated and purchase a very expansive 250 frame that a week later went on sale for 60 percent off
they said they would email my release at 8 am and after they received the filled out copy it would take at least 7 business days to get the records to my new doc
whenever i go anywhere i want to be treated like paris hilton or some other awesome celebrity and if i do i always return
they have since called me to make other appointments and seem to have an attitude when i say i will call them if i would like to make another appointment
needless to say she ended up seeing a pa dr daulat is a very cold person and has no compassion for his patients
i could not do a yearly because after i got my lasik i moved out west
it is a build up
i cant recommend ritebite enough
i put my chin back in the strap and he says oh never mind your eyes are already dilated
they put my braces on a few year ago and i love my smile and if i ever have a question i know they are still there for meyears after i got my braces off
the reason why this is my favourite place for foot massage is mainly because they have a tv in the room
i was lucky that on a sunday evening it wasnt very busy
i have received treatments at other offices where they charged me an absolute horrifying amount of money
first time there today and it will be my last for sure
is that really a service you want to be involved with
didnt expect results
well last december of 2016 i decided i had to get him something
this is the type of place that cuts corners and makes excuses for their errors
the staff knows me and my family by name providers are gentle with me and let me make all my own choices without selling me any treatment and i get to call the dentists by their first names to discuss issues on an equal level
he is very accommodating to me being pregnant and is able to adjust me just fine
this place is amazing
i always see valisa when i get my teeth cleaned
and i know it takes much longer to go through my pharmacy then just simply reply yes or no on refills
i think theyre highly underappreciated in general
i cant thank dr woods enough he is a miracle worker
it wasnt comfortable to say the least
i only met on doctor once time in 65 months and met with a different nurse every time
i am not rating the eye exam service because i did not buy it
when it comes to fit and finish on glasses nobody beats ernest
rough couple of years going through this but he had a plan and i couldnt be more pleased based on what i looked like when he took my case on
if i lived in the area i would defiantly be here more
we loved lily yoki and mable so far
i really hope that the manager and staff at esplanade location really take a look at how they do facials and the manager needs to prioritize customers
the next day my lower back was hurting and i knew i had to get a massage
cds are just so expensive
i had to call them twice and even went there personally before they call and get the prescription thru
we recently gave birth here via unplanned csection after a long and difficult labor
i cut my finger open and they made the experience so great
i started going to teresa in june 2015 she is excellent in both massage and hot stone treatment
i highly recommend dr tomaro as you will not regret it
staff is unknowledgeable and doctor is condescending
overall this was as good as a prenataldelivery experience that i could have asked for from a healthcare provider
never had an issue at any other massage envy or other massage establishments
i decided on having dysport injections and michelle made me feel so comfortable with my decision
they know their stuff
even though this isnt considered invasive surgery its still a process that you have to be very careful with
st rose peds has always taken great care of us
i got an appointment quickly after calling and the scheduling was easy
while dr banich has a sense of humor and seems like a friendly funny guy his behavior communicates that doesnt care about his patients
thank you dr athari
she then handed my husband a tablet to fill out tons of his past medical information that they had us come in a half hour before the appointment to fill out
dr heetland was very thorough personable and easy to talk to
it was the best investment ive ever given myself
after therapeutic massages she is fine now
i found a few good deals on groupon but wasnt happy with the reviews i read and with a bad back i wanted to put my back in good hands
got my entire family signed up and referred many others
i would recommend him to anyone looking for a dentist
some yoga studios feel sterile and soulless and this is not one of them
i love that the crown can be done in one day instead of the traditional method of getting a temporary and then returning for the real one
i was trying to tell her my problem and she kept interrupting me and then hung up on me
would highly recommend
this gym is not only affordable but it is worth every penny i pay so i could get my life and my strength back
theres times where the scheduler sets all my appointments and i find out way after they dont call and ask you or anything they just do it without telling you or even asking if the time would work
that night the broccoli was cleaned from his plate
just an additional note  my boyfriend went for his appointment and they gave him some free bathsalts due to the inconvenience
save your dollars and go to a professional and licensed massage therapist
im ashamed of myself for not being more aware and im angry that this medical practice took so much of mine and my insurances money
he reassembled and told me to take it for a spin to check it outall was perfect
u better be dying hemorrhaging or in labor right now they just transfer u back into the voicemail system
i didnt know what he was doing and i didnt respond right away so he repeated this  clothes pin motion three more times quickly instead of  just telling me to close my lips
ill be calling them again in the future when i am ready to replace the ancient opener on the single door
the first call back i received for my test results was on christmas eve when the clinic was closed
they were unaware that we wanted a cleaning to be scheduled on the same day
they go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable and taken care of
niccol made me very comfortable and explained everything to me ahead of time so there was no surprises
when we were walked through the spa to be shown around we did not get the explanation of the stones and the moroccan sky etc
im single i have no family to help back at home except my kids so i rather wait until after the holidays and i had just left the er that they sent me to and they said im exactly where i needed to be
so this place is aok in mine  moms book
i would recommend this office to anyone with any skin issue or concerns
my husband and i were a little token back and shocked the way he had spoke to me
never going back
theyre so friendly knowledgeable and helpful
i will definitely return
they genuinely care about their patients and are not about the money but the care
and then i just got a call that says i owe them a copay for my physical because preexisting was discussed
most outrageous was that she ordered tests be sent to me to do at home and send back without ever discussing them with me
my tooth was fine
i was a previous patient of dr poulos and had the worst dental experience of my life that i am still dealing with years later
they were sure to keep me up to date on out of pocket costs and if id feel comfortable doing all 3 cavities in one sitting
this was my second time getting my lips done and they are so natural and i had no bruising and very little swelling after i got them done
first couple of minutes into the massage she made quick adjustments to her technique to match my level of comfort
hmmmif someone uses square to take a payment in the same time frame my phone should be going off with a payment confirmation email and theirs should be too
visiting other specialists offices has caused me to truly appreciate dr underhill and his staff
again listening as she worked she proceeded to put the finishing touches
she didnt look me in the eye and showed absolutely no interest in my health at all
this location the doctors and the front desk staff were amazing
he did not try and charge a whole lot and said i only needed very little and that is what he did
i arrived at the maryland office an hour early and am told that dr yepremyan now has an emergency and has left the office and wont return until 430pm
i literally sat here and cried for 3 hours w no regard for me as a human let alone as a pregnant woman
beautiful modern fresh decor up to date equipments
then he wanted to hit them with freeze spray
ive been going here for a number of years and have always very satisfied with the experience
i actually cried because i had felt they had been so compassionate only to punish me like this later
it wouldnt be so bad but it was clear from her experience that they were trying to push through as many people as they could in as short a time as possible
however if im not pleased then it is up to me to voice my concern and try someone else
22115 now edgepark is telling me that i owe them money
ive never received service like that from a doctors office
the price isnt too far from the cross fit program i wanted to join
this man works teeth like a musician works fine instrument
the tools and resources at tnf taught her has enabled her to better cope with lifes challenges
i used to only get swedish massage that relaxing type involving more kneading sliding gliding and sometimes falling asleep me not the therapist
instead of doing their last minute call to the insurance company since my wife assured then we would be there early for her appointment they did not call until well after we arrived
the staff is very rude and impatient
i got a body massage hot stone reflexology chiropractic visit and chinese lesson all in one
love this place
we highly recommend stephanie
lotion is applied for smooth strokes
45 minute  1 hr hold times before getting a representative
i had an epidural so my legs were completely numb
i am already a fan of chiropractic but have no real back nerve or spine issues of note however sometimes you just need to get adjusted to keep everything in alignment
if youre thinking about going to this place stop thinking and just do it its seriously will be the best investment you will make in yourself
it all went smoothlythe staff was professional and nice
they customize your treatments
this doc didnt seem to care about my well being and didnt care enough to take better precautions with my blood results
dr petranu is such an amazing doctor
i was treated like trash and will never go back to aspen dental
they have this ion cleanse treatment too thats pretty cool
after spending no more than 2 minutes with dr ricardo mogollon i was diagnosed with a deep pain
conveniently parked on the street because hes an adult and knows how to work a street
i feel like a million bucks after each massage
everyone i encountered was very friendly
tami is very sweet
your hands are magic
every time i come here ive waited at least 3hrs to be seen
then do it all over again
i was there the entire time and never saw this doctor
place is terrible waited 3 12 hours to be seen by doc
i dont always see her sometimes i see her nurse practioner which is fine because i understand she is an obgyn and delivers babies so there are times that she was very late or didnt show up but again she delivers babies and cant tell them to wait to come out because she has patients waiting
hes really gentle on you and knows what he is doing
thank you dr webster and your team
i recently booked a 90 minute massage with lorel something i wanted to try for a while
i would recommend her to anyone as she really takes the time to give her patients the care that they need
first visit she scooped out the problem molar and fitted a temporary crown
i was able to walk out feeling relaxed and better than i had in days
alls good so far
so you want a new you
she had to hop on one foot down the long sidewalk of our apartment complex to the car
the staff is great and good with kids
he was an allsmiles guy great sense of humor and quick
brianna assured me that she could cancel my membership but that i would only have 30 days to use 6 unused sessions
even with that i continued to go back just because i liked dr rojas and it was close to homework
soon after i signed up for a 9 month package with unlimited consultation from the dietician within 6 months they stopped all face to face consultation and said that i still have an option for email consultation
as far as the overall environment very nice
i am getting married in less than two months and was panicking over my broken out skin
i had what i expected to be the most humiliating experience of my life a colonoscopy
i love this place they are very cordial and friendly
i decided to try it one last time and omg this was maybe 3 years ago and it is still going strong
i love brittany
she took the time to show me the extent of the damage i feared i would loose the tooth because it was a pretty significant crack and small chip
was it expansive o remove mercury in a safe enviroment
i wont name names here but i would definitely read other reviews and make a judgement call on your own
my 8 year old daughter as well as my 39 year old nieces and nephews have gone yoga crazy at reginas kids yoga class offered once a week at metta
but by far the worst thing that i cant forgive any doctor for is having each appointment be like we have never met
ive been to chiropractors for a while
his assistant sarah is so awesome too
if youre looking for a miracle by which you can lose 50 lbs have it last forever and do essentially nothing for it you are bound to be endlessly disappointed with any endevour
i am so glad i did
i feel better from iv s i get there and i would recommend them
i wish they could move to berkeley
truly fantastic staff

i liked that she uses a laser and not scissors to do the cutting
my new gym and i love it
her partner is not nor is she helpful
and its not open 10 to 5 mf its 24x7
i really wish i chose shampoo plan if i knew
dr stokes is the best dentist ive ever been to
very friendly staffs  great  dr ken wagner  everybody work like great orchestra
hands down i would recommend acupunture of the carolinas to all my family and friends you will not be disappointed
i would stay awaydont even touch them with a 10 foot pole
the office staff is always confused as to whom i am and if i should or should not have a copay
deborah and her amazing toothfairy companion came out to my school legacy traditional school  gilbert to give a presentation to my physical education classes on proper dental care
i didnt tear and luckily i only used 10 of my epidural
dr athari and his staff are all very nice and pleasant to be around
i absolutely love dr george and his entire staff
ive been waiting 50 mins to be called back
sometimes i think people get overwhelmed by the class because its different and sometimes can be packed
the clinic has a store inside for eyeglasses as well  i found a great pair for a reasonable price and the gentleman helping me out i forgot his name boo gave great suggestions and gave me quotes and available discounts
the millers are good peolpe and good at their job
i really like the smaller down to earth nature of dr e and her staff
the experience is always awesome
what office does that in todays time
but i had called weeks before and asked how the appt was supposed to go they said oh he takes his time and goes over everything with you about an hr he will spend with you
i didnt feel a thing
her appointment was 2 months out and she just returned in tears
from the moment i walked in i couldnt believe how friendly quick and efficient everyone was
i spend hours upon hours at this gym to better myself and i find it an amazing escape with a great environment great teammates and an amazing coach
my husband and i continued talking about our experience hours afterwards
he is completely knowledgable in his field
dr rothman is highly trainedexperienced and has decent jokes
people working were pretty kind but im wishing i had taken the longer drive to st rose
then you have a pt tech the rest of the time and usually a different one every time
do not go there
my appointments have been scheduled correctly but i dont think a message i have ever left has been given to the doctorsnot cool
there is no motivation by intimidation only positive feedback yielding real results

erica then tried to guilt me by saying that she had a death in the family and sorry the death was an inconvenience
eli and david were so awesome my parents ended up having them go to their house as well
if you actually want to manage your chronic pain go see him
the 2 times i went there was horrible
they also gave me a shot to speed up recovery
that being said
she is so rude and was the final straw in deciding to leave this office
im not sure when these other people were there but i personally had a great time when i was there
very calm  zen like a good value
he is friendly approachable and will put his full attention on you
dr a is absolutely amazing and whistles while he works
now that i found brent im done bouncing
i had first come the the facility because i feared that my increasing age coupled with my grueling travel and work schedule had taken its toll on my body and was concerned that my natural testosterone was significantly off
i was not happy about the situation where they felt justified to bring me in the office for all of maybe 10 minutes take my blood pressure look in my ear and nose and then have me leave with nothing more than i already knew
dr heap and team are amazing
crime is a problem
i go to him now just for maintenance as i work out regularly and find that his realignments keep me balanced
i highly recommend this place to anyone suffering from asthma or allergies
she actually explained the way teeth are made up and why i was experiencing sensitivity
he respected that
each time weve gone to the bright side and been so happy with the results
well i had a one hour credit from my monthly membership and then there was a 30 minute credit from the last time they messed up my scheduling
dr grice quickly discovered the root of my pain explained the issue adjusted me accordingly and then gave me advice to keep the pain from returning

she was fantastic and took great care of us
mindy is the best
if youre putting off trying rm3 stop  just go do it
our insurance can sometimes be a little tricky to work with but they go the extra mile to insure everything is coded and submitted properly
sorry  evans on 5th floor youd get 5 stars but the hospital  dr gluck took them away
nobody asked my  name or if they could help me with anything or even if i was being helped
our family had been with this practice for over 10 years and rose has been a constant
ive been to other places in vegas that have left me scarred so he made sure to work with the laser intensity with my sensitive skin so i wouldnt have a bad reaction
primary care providers come and go
i go back next week for a steroid shot in my tailbone and they put you under for that i think
this place is great
still in shock still dont have my medical records left with no care and completely embarrassed
i have been to the steinberg diagnostics  location on tenya and this one is truly the better of the two in my opinion
sheryl told me to bring him in right away
very friendly staff
so dr lee is a horrible dr switched over to another doctor in the same facility and it was exactly the same
ive been going to dr ryan for 15 plus years and i wouldnt go anywhere else
i felt relaxed as if id just had a lengthy reiki session with some burdens lifted and things to ponder
thanks to dr roles i am pain free
i am a new patient and felt very comfortable with every person i engaged with
i went there for almost a year and there was always new staffthe turnover in his office speaks volumes
what a joke
come here if you have nowhere else to go
both girls didnt know why they were doing they were new
this dr was very short with me each time i went in
i feel like this clinic bills consistently and as a result i can anticipate my responsibly
i had a small filling on 28 to be done and it took maybe 10 minutes
i was on vacation in toronto spending a relaxing day at the beach when i was lured in by the 39 first time massage offer
his knowledge is vast his heart is ever soft and his energy is infectious
dr seagle is wonderful
he sent there and the therapist was his best friend
great office staff and dr jensen was wonderful with my anxious daughter
i call the other office and they tell me that will be fine to come on in but after speaking with the other office they then said we have the same policy its bad enough to be going through a situation and these people who are on a power trip make it worsedont be ridiculous seriously
nobody likes extractions but dr calder makes it bearable
for me it was same day
we bought a group deal for 60 minute rmt massages but realized after we booked the appointment that it wasnt valid yet
i was told when i arrived that dr blotnick was in the university location
i had a reading with lilly today she has a truly amazing talent she is very honest and kind she read me like an open book without me telling her anything what she told me about all aspects of my life finance family relationships was very accurate i couldnt help but cry when she told me what feelings i have deep inside and since when she blew my mind because i have always kept those feelings for myself she was caring and gave advise on the areas i need to work in my life
best time to go is between 2832 weeks of pregnancy
dr grover is a first rate doctor that listened to me instead of putting politics above medicine and performed a successful surgery on me as well
i will definitely go back and have highly recommended him to my family and friends
the staff are friendly however the turnover is high which isnt a positive reflection on the managementownership
weve been patients of dr rorisons for a few years now
it was a lot of money then i never heard from them again
the unlv gym is definitely my favorite place to work out
the dermasweep has rejuvenated my skin at least so far
again kelly is the goto girl for getting the process started
cons on the small side you get what you pay for though could have a broader selection of machinesweights again its limited only by the sq footage could use a few interior upgradesminor fixes
i guess i am a creature of habits
wait wasnt long compassionate care nice location
i have insurance i did not need a referral
regular visits definitely had a positive impact on my overall health and injury prevention
ok so the house is 14 years old so the springs were going to give out sooner or later
i tried to explain this to jill again shortly after my daughters birth our dissatisfaction with lydi  but it fell on deaf ears
the best dental services in vegas and henderson
dr parker is fantastic as well last time i visited he stayed with me until all my questions were answered
i got my bp and o2 sat checked about an hour ago
i had no idea how long i was going to have to wait
this is my  opinion  and i choose to share it with the general public at large
we are definitely considering to change offices
no can do
very clean relaxing and i actually laugh when i am here
the office staff was second to none
they do absolutely everything they can to accommodate you
kids are always comfortable in the exam room
we love him and his staff and being pain free
i ended up getting the infinity heart redone by my right shoulder originally by the left
if you dont like your job dont do it
i gave birth to my child at this hospital and my husband and i really enjoyed our stay there
but what really scared me was that the hygienist never took time to review my sons file before coming into the exam room and they only blamed their lap for the error
i had my teeth scraped polished and cleaned like any standard visit and was sent my on my way
paperwork could be filled out in advance to minimize wait room times
i could go on and on but i think you get the gist of it
they always gave me the best quality service and i have recommended everyone i can to them
they take walkins too if their schedule allows which i really appreciate since my own schedule is often in flux
if you need tools to cope this place is for you
he checked me out and told me he could help and it did not take more than 40min and i was fixed and out of there
none of the work she did looked natural and i would never go here again
i have improved my rating from 1 star to 3 for that
in my experience this is completely unheard of
filled out the forms got called back and she talked me through what she was going to do explained what the popping and cracking sounds were and it made sense slightly comforted
i just found my rmt nancy talked a little too much for my liking
my husband and i are coming back for sure
at the end he asked me several times if i had any other questions so they really care to listen to the patient and make sure we walk out with questions answered and not be confused about anything it was a really nice experience
hes helpful and explains everything to me and really listens to me and my concerns and doesnt rush me out
the first root canals had been done years prior from a dentist and he showed me how much more complete he filled the nerve cavity that the former dentist did not do
i will be back
all that could have been avoided if they would have taken the wheelchair out to him in the first place
and honestly id made it six months ago and it really wasnt going to be easy so i told her it really wasnt a great time but i did confirm id be there
i signed up for there membership
despite its proximity to my home i will never be a patient at this clinic
a quick anecdote especially important for families when our eldest was almost 3 shes now 22 she had been to the dentist for a get to know him gratis visit
prices are great too
and if i absolutely have to pay out of pocket i would theyre that nice
after postponing that surgery the doctor said he would keep 7500 for postponing the surgery but would not penalize me id i had the surgery donebut was unable to because of my broken back
the nurses were not friendly very short with us and showed no kindness
this fight is far from over
they offer water
not a bad dentist but a terrible customer service
to top it all off they make a mold of your teeth and give you free teeth whitening bleach as long as you keep up on your 6 month appointments
you dont need to worry about that so dreaded air puff that makes your eyes water because you know its coming
she had no information for me other then to completely frighten me about the medications im currently taking
everything is clearly labeled and priced  great lighting lab results weighed in front of you
i only go to this nail salon because theyre open later than most salons and its the closest to my homebasically just settling
he will yell and curse until he gets what he wants
deep roots  beet carrot apple celery lemon  again a fan of all ingredients
we are very pleased with their service and will continue using them
i went into this officedropped off my insurance card andmy idso they can check my coverage
they wanted a more thorough medical history than my general practitioner has
they are always answering their phones or call back immediately and follow up
i was given a sheet with the things he was tested for and some marks which werent explained
gave jessup the boot
the way they schedule appointments and their time management is unacceptable
i will definitely be back for cleanings and future procedures
the process clearly was misrepresented
urgent care fail
i highly recommend them
they do an excellent job on my families teeth and keep our smiles healthy
nah wouldnt be back my son  i went here for a checkup and nay dental work needed and after constantly telling the billing coordinator that i did not have time to get anything done due to a later appt she constantly pushed and pushed and pushed me to pay for services like a damn car salesman
if youre looking for a new dentist this is the place
either you take it out or ill find a lawyer who will
1 i never met with the doctor before surgery
i couldnt be happier with how my appointment went
i got in right on time without having to wait like most doctors make you do
its conveniently located right beside broadview subway station
the mr got several jackets and i even got one for myself and you know what
had to come in and fill out paperwork all over again because of the ownership change and meet my new doctor
i would recommend him to everyone
real results is the best gym in town
i was worried after reading the reviews
had a wonderful experience getting a gel manipedi
when she left my daughter was in the best of moods
there are so many wonderful clinicians to be found here that can really help people get back on track and meet their goals
at the very least it needs a new paint job
4 the place inside is rundown and for the lack of a better word sketchy
he is so knowledgeable and professional and i trust him 100
but thats a personal thing that says absolutely nothing about their business which is otherwise excellent
not only are they extremely knowledgeable but very friendly and fun to be around
there is no question that dr brown and his staff at comfort care dental group saved the day
2 the er is just like most others
dr niman was happy to see id had ortho work and i didnt get into whether that causes grindinggum recession with him
of course afterwards they get a new toothbrush and tooth paste but the exciting part is the coin they get
i came in for a blue print for wellness at quest diagnostics on lake mead at 0830signed in and waitedthe office was already full with people who needed quest diagnostics services
she brought them all to me so i didnt have to stand or walk through the store
zen was really great at making my naked self comfortable which was a relief
patients are treated with respect and compassion
i absolutely love this place
i can test it right here under a microscope then we will get to your questions
the second time i saw him was the day of the surgery
good point lol
divorce often leads to a lowering of the socioeconomic class of a women
they were very disrespectful and just didnt care about any of the patients horrible service do not come here they wont hep you with anything they will just send you somewhere else
i love boot camp las vegas
i have lived in las vegas for 35 years and used several doctors and she is among the best
whats best is how efficient everyone is
the doctor was with us for less than 10 minutes
i have gotten in far more time and range of departments than i ever could have wanted
the best foot spa
i definitely recommend acadia eye care to anyone looking to have their eyes checked out or just for a new pair of glasses
finally someone answered and made nothing but excuses and was very defensive
so very hurt and disappointed was charged 100 for appointments not confirmed really you want to charge  before even seeing your patients  hello we have lifes too would be nice if your office mgr was human oh well it is what it is amy
the staff there are very friendly and helpful as well
thanks to whoever cancelled  about the office wow
had all of my personal belongings taken away including my underwear
pursuit also holds classes in some corners of the space which you can use when the classes are not in session
oh wait medical science hasnt exactly confirmed that ionic foot baths and applied kinesiology do anything except drain your bank account
would come again
he also provided my sister and i some beverages
i have never had a bad dentist experienceuntil aspen
my father is in a wheelchair and they bring him right into whichever clinic he needs to be
its a newer facility but has been open for well over a year now
everyone is kind and happy when you walk in
i realized it was because i had activated my core without thinking what maureen had told me would eventually happen
crystal was helpful
thereve been some hiccups with staff
i walked in with no appointment
my thanks goes out to them for always giving their all
but if you upgrade to the more expensive massage they do remove the towel and the massage is a little bit longer
i was in a room within 10 mins of walking through the door
i have had prior issues with benefits at this location and had a recent procedure where i asked the scheduler and again registration when i checked in if everything was covered and they said they verified
my son needed several filings but became ill from the anesthetic theyd used midway through the procedure
quality is superb
i was a frequent visitor to childrens when i was younger which was before it was located in lawrenceville
dr rothman explained everything clearly answered all questions me or my family had and was great every step of the way from the initial consultation to postsurgical followup
simply try to get an appt ahhahahahh its been close to an hour 3 different people 2 different location tempe locationm found my info in system but i need mesa because i need  yearly retina exam mesa can not find my info to make an appt still on hold update to follow
he is the owner and only physical therapist at synergy  which means you will have him 1 on 1 at every session
i have made at least a dozen calls to this place and have been called back two times and after getting really upset and demanding to talk to the office manager
the nurse and physician were very professional and friendly
i needed to see a chiro  pronto
we arrived and i believe it was casey and a young girl she had a bad car wreck and told us about it which really helped me see what floating can do but i cant remember her name so sorry
the variety of classes allows for any type of yogi to practice here
it took me almost 20 minutes to pay and leave after my massage
i told her i was not paying that and i should only be liable for a copay
i do not recommend dr grondel unfortunately he is not worth the wait
i did return the second time bc i had already purchased a full vile and had to finish the second half
they have some specials going on
i only waited about 15 minutes  and got taken care of by these amazing people
the two women running the front desk are super friendly and easy to speak with
this seems like an odd subject and place to give a review on
i ended up walking out without seeing anyone
that is why i drop in to healthy habit
decided to check this place out because they had a good deal on grouponnow
my daughter has had to have 2 root canals
she is very polite and funny  her positive attitude is contagious and you feel you are in good hands
nsfm now has no female doctors on their staff
however since all the doctors they have are professional friendly and competent i dont really mind
i like the whole jungle theme and staff is friendly
afternoon appointments seemed to be habitually late 20 min in waiting room 10 to 15 in exam room so try for an am appointment if possible
the only one that i know for sure is a certified trainer is the older white lady everyone else doesnt even know what there doing
just to save him from wiring the cash to me
they emailed us most of the paperwork to be completed before arriving which made the whole visit that much quicker
from the second i walked through this office i felt like i made a great decision
to give you some background ive been getting strep throat multiple times a year since i was 10 now i managed to avoid it the last three years but a few weeks ago i got it once again
they walk out n and i made a comment to let them know i wasnt comfortable with the dog sniffing me while they walked away
one thing i would say is leave extra time for parking
i went here after i had a serious fall and direct blow to my elbow
i will continue to see dr mikel in the future
the office manager gives me a sob story about how the girl is new  how they are shortstaffed etc
we walked in and she barked as us ill be with you when i can
dr smooke is great he really works with you
i had an implanted front tooth placed by another oral surgeon in california 12 years ago that became infected was failing and had to be removed
we will not continue to sends checks
none of my problems were addressed such as unbearable hot flashes and possibly changing my medication
he tried his best to get the knots out of my shoulders
i was taken back by the pain i experienced when he sat on my foot to isolate the movement of my leg
they were greatso relaxed that i fell asleep and even ended up snoring
that happens too
a skilled knowledgable professional who does a fantastic job
even stating how he likes them to be done to a lady who was there temporarily
complained that she didnt have any downtime during her 3 hour scheduled service period and i paid her for the duration of the 3 hour service timeyou are a vendor and i paid you to be there not to rest sorry this is unacceptable  complained that i didnt check in on her during the event to see if they needed anything sorry you are not a guest but a vendor i am obviously busy attending to the actual guests of the event and not there to see if i the client need to get you the vendor anything
garbage on the floor garbage on the carts lots of gross looking crud on the water fountains and in the sinks in the room
im very grateful for dr lee and his staff
just an update did finally resolve new lenses issue to near perfect
im very happy
they are perfect for all members of the family
i questioned the girl at the front desk and she said it goes by appointments
i recently had a massage as well it was great
it was a fantastic kick start to my new healthy lifestyle and before my trip home to hawaii
danielle is awesome  its always a delight to see angie
only one lady at the front desk was very friendly everyone one else in the office seemed less than thrilled to be there
ive been going at least once a month for over 6 months now and for the first time recently i witnessed how a patron got up and left her session and the sheet was taken off the seat lightly shook and placed back on the chair
im amazed in how much care  time you put into every patient of yours
everyone was friendly and so helpful
all artist from this shop is fantastic
so how could his 98 stats he tells his patients for never hitting the nerve be accurate
unlike the doctors i have been to in the past dr greene was prompt friendly and knowledgeable
so amazing with my son who was terrified of going
complete waste of your money and time
michelle is an expert at what she does  she is always friendly and personable i have referred a few people to her and will continue to do so
the lady at the front desk asked me how i got her number
the gal that escorted me to the chair end up being my masseuse
i just wish they would accept multiple issues in a single visit instead they ask you to come on a different day for a second issue you may be having
i had 2 hours before the wedding when i called and they said they could pencil me in 30 minutes from my call which also happened to be just after they were closing for the day
i was a patient there for 3 years before moving
only giving it 4 stars as it is quite expensive  if there could be some discount for regular customers or more package deals then that would make it a perfect 5
they have support in place via email
i will definitely go back to him for more work and highly recommend them to anyone in the vegas area
i brought my son here for some glasses our first time here
they state crowns in a day
i have been to other med spas over the years and no one has given me these pigment reduction results
you would think something like this would take some time to get used to but because of the expertise and the time he took to make them perfect i am already receiving compliments
also his office manager needs to be educated that its not ok to talk to one patient about the problems of the patient in the next room this is extremely inappropriate and most likely a hipaa violation
in a good way
i shouldve written this review back when we first started going to alameda crossing dental group and things were fresher in my mindill try to get all the good stuff in
like other reviewers on yelp i can attest that dr wilson and his staff are a class act
do yourself a favor and go check out tempe community acupuncture to find your own escape and to help remedy any ailments you may have
i love dr scott connell and tina
when my partner came they did a proceeder that was supposed to take an hour
overall it was a nice relaxing and effective massage
i got the impression that she was highly intimidated by them
my eye doctors choice of frames was a joke so i headed here expecting just to look at frames to see what choices they had but not expecting that id purchase anything because its stupid of me to buy full price when i have insurance
dr lowe was patient and kind
i bought a groupon for a combination massage and facial which i used today
came in at 1pm for a 115 appointment
i have a been diagnosed with a nasty form of arthritis and dr darrell is keeping me mobile
it soon became clear that she was tired and her body was worn out
they will take some xrays of  your teeth so that the doctor can evaluate your treatment plan
i was very pleasantly surprised when i arrived at this new facility
they should not be allowed to answer calls and questions
to my shock i was told that that could not or would not be done since i was a member of another massage envy i asked to speak with the manager but was advised the manager was not available
but i already pay plenty to have insurance and i really dont like paying more than i have to
god has blessed her with the gift of touch
they are also not tired into the better business bureau which makes me wonder who else they have screwed
this means that the doctor was paid by the collection agency and the insurance
hardest part is keeping your mouth open for several hours
its nice to know they hire trustworthy employees thank you to nadhara
how does this clinic plan to maintain regular clients
he does not even follow up with his patients after a month or so
dr kim looked at my teeth said they were great and even gave me a prescription for a sensitive tooth i have
the nurses were pretty good and they answered what they could
the next day  saturday  i called back and dr julie wu answered but could tell not me what the phone call was regarding
i really enjoyed going to zen for my laser treatment hair removal however it is now august and the area that was treated is fully growingi called and left them a message because i have had laser before and not sure why it is growing back as muchit seems as though their laser may not be as good as ithey thought
when i confronted them they didnt have much to say about it at all
i have to say they were all very professional and made me feel welcomed
i was in the market for a new optometrist after moving here a couple years ago so took my friends up on their review and decided to book an appointment
i recently moved out here from california and was looking for a new doctor for my 8 year old
had to explain myself  she is really rude and over heard her being rude to another target employee
im upset because brian didnt give my husband time to consider brians talk about the importance of not drinking
i will give them one more chance but two strikes and your out with me
go see her  your back will love you for it
my favourite person here dr darcie sinclair
also their prices were extremely reasonable
his office is very comfy and very clean
her methods and technique are beyond compare
although appointments are not necessary it is highly recommended
jennifer told me they send out bills monthly and i should have gotten them
after rehabbing my knee i started working with the athletic sports performance trainer chris
he will be my dentist for sure in az
but as i was in the room getting my vitals done i hear a nurse go i didnt know a uti was an emergency
i asked if she could prescribe me an antibiotic and she just stared at me
i have also booked a couple of massages there and sharon his massage therapist works wonders on the body
i only wanted to give you some pointers but instead of listening you just claim its not true and must be the guy next door
1205 pm lady walks in and say hi im here super early i dont mind waiting but i want get everything set up
they have some highpressure sales tactics but honestly they probably are telling the truth that you need 5 sessions to see the full permanent effect
the one large sun spot i had on my cheek is literally dissolving and breaking up
i would definitely recommend the visionworks  the arrowhead mall location is fantastic
luckily i thought i would atleast see if dr dom could help
rude woman terrible service never again will dignity get my money
thought this was weird
the woman who answered my call was not able to tell me what was included in a routine eye exam specifically if a glaucoma test was included
if i could give no stars i would
my boys 4 and 8 saw dr bailey he was fantastic with both of them and very patient with me mom and all my zillions of questions
he hung up on me in the middle of my sentence
this is ridiculous
the dentist at aspen dental who did all of the substandard work is no longer employed however that doesnt help me now
if you can go to a clinic it will save you thousands
man nothing like relaxing the body
i have absolutely nothing negative to say
i scheduled an appointment online for the next day and went in and didnt really have to wait long
dr brian was my dentist
love the halloween decorations
everything about this class was right on
i left my ultrasound appointment crying as they were testing their new machine on me and found  more and more things that were wrong with the baby
whatever the stuff is he used on the chip is amazing
even after the surgery with my follow up appointments have been great
i used to love my doctor but the office staff are just terrible avoid this place
i tried to go check out some sunglasses on sunday august 14
who knows how many other times it had been used without disinfecting the top before drawing it up
tarin at the front desk was extremely welcoming polite and was such a doll
it was clean and modern
highly highly highly recommend
i was referred to dr sullivan because of multiple problems i drove over 100 miles to get to him so i made sure they set me up for enough time to remove one tooth and also do a root canal buildup and a new custom crown made in his office while you wait
other smaller errors have occurred and unfortunately im stuck with them until my braces come on because theyre closest to my house
its not even 7 yet how do you know youre going to have conflicts at this time
i went in on wednesday and found out i had swimmers ear the discharge notes stated if it got worse that i should contact your office
will definitely continue wrap sessions here
all the girls are amazing
even though i told her i had had many treatments over the years she still walked me through her process and the different products she offered which i liked
dr tom armbrust is an excellent chiropractor
i was there for 2 hours with no one in the waiting room and no one in the exam rooms
the hospital is really changing in a positive way
he definitely understands the implications of what a scoliosis does to a person
im not the doctor here and she made it very clear that she was above us in every way down to the faces she would make while speaking to us
i was in and out the door in 30 minutes and the doctor was super friendly  best walk in experience ever
i had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain i later found out i had a kidney stone i got up and asked someone to turn it off
that was concerning to me but i trusted things to be fixed competently regardless
i dont have to sit here and fill everything out while you try to rush another patient through
the atmosphere is awesome front desk associates are friendly and the earlier you arrive the more relaxed you will be
i must say that the staff have always been relatively courteous despite the frequency of angry angry people they encounter
i dont even know where to begin because every detail of every part of our dental experience with tpd was beyond exceptional  even to me a very very picky mom
either speed it up or have appts available for ppl
staff is awesome
once again i am pain free
this is supposed to be a health care facility not a care less facility
sometimes it can be a bit slow but generally they get to you pretty quick
he has a technique for every problem area and then knowledge to get you to your goals
i got out of there fast and hysterically and every time i drive by her office i have to shut down the urge to go in and tell everyone to run for their lives
i have a very sick son and the lazy doctor and staff turned us away at 415
this is by far the best clinic i have been to in ontario
i had to wait 2 hours to see the doctor
i was the only one in there at 4 am and they made me wait an hour to go back even though i was laying across all the chairs screaming and crying in pain from my stomach
and thank god i have shitty vision
a clean office and courteous staff gave me even more confidence that dr wall and his team really get it
dr cheng is sooo friendly
i just came back from a appointment with dr kern
they bring a small scoop of yuzu citrus fruit sorbet free after the meal
alright so this thing makes me assign at least one star only one star for the evil empire booooooo hisssssss
we arrive and check in
not too bad just an inconvenience to immediately have to purchase more bulbs from the store
call his office for an appt
when i came back i was able to produce the sample followed all instructions including letting the technician know when i was finished
dr bui is so good with kids its remarkable
ive been coming to this location for years and have never been super impressed
i called back 10 minutes late when i was able to
my therapist lisa did a great job and she was nice as well
thank goodness for yelp
she used a numbing gel prior to the treatment and there was hardly any pain
im glad i did
our first round of iui was unsuccessful
she is one internist who does not try to just make money

its hard to put into words how wonderful dr pontikas and his staff are
fast simple and super easy
i have been a patient of strimling dermatology for 5 years and i love them

i have taken my dog to a few vet clinics around vegas and they would always resort to drugs and cage rest for my dog and not actually healing her
the technology seems to be very uptodate
the program helped me keep organized and discipline to stay on point
she answers all our questions and concerns and explained our childrens health and details to us

on every occasion he has always suggested the least aggressive and least expensive
great staff great service
i asked her to not touch my length but just to literally shape them a touch from the sides

the massage was great
sherry has an amazingly soothing voice and helped me tremendously with an addiction i had
abalos has a soft touch and calming voice and raquel is quick witted and fun
now i was in the market for a new doctor and i was lucky enough to find dr jen burke
if i could give this place 0 stars i would for rudeness and incompetence
very competitive pricing and i am a regular customer
my obgyns office referred me to them
my technician was friendly and made me feel at ease
walking into a new chiropractic place always fills me with a wee bit of trepidation
the best service ever they really care and melissa campbell and her manager jene were really concerned about my well being and went over different options for future plans
i cant say enough great things about dr amols and his staff
after my pancreas issues settled a bit he treated my ibs which the other doctors were treating me for previously
i have also been forgotten about on two different visits for half an hour thats have my visit and when they relized they forgot to start the heat treatment at the beginning of my treatmentinstead of getting the heat they just skipped me right through the time as if i had heat therapy and had done 20mins for streachin
not only did he impress me with his expertise he really made me feel so at ease and took care of everything pain free
ive been going to them for eye care for 5 years and i recommend them to everyone
the nurse asked me preliminary questions there and i was told to wait
i highly recommend you call first as walk in appointments are hard to come by as they are getting more popular
they are not qualified or competent enough to handle it
then when i left i had tapped a bumper on a truck
terrible service

i highly recommend him if you have that last stubborn 10lbs that you have tried everything for

i almost didnt come here because there were a lot of bad yelp reviews but they were open late and i didnt want to go to the er instead

i  went to this dental group for help with a broken tooth
after searching and trying out a couple of massage places over the past several years i finally settled into a good place
she was knowledgeable gentle kind and a true perfectionist which i greatly appreciated
the social worker came out and spoke with the white woman but not to jasmine completely ignoring her and worst of all as soon as jasmine spoke up for her right to speak to someone with zero attitude they called security to stand nearby just in case
one time i went in for an appointment and was informed that dr pollock was delivering a baby and was going to be late
get your nails done with debra or megan you wont regret it
we scheduled our appointment and the staff was amazing the first visit had a rocky start with scheduling and they couldnt find us in the schedule but after it got cleared up it was fabulous
anyone looking to be treated for lyme or any other chronic illness will receive the best care
this continuity in the event you suffer a yelp induced weight setback is reassuring
it is to the point that we are sitting in their waiting room on a friday afternoon with the intention of not leaving until they actually make the call
the doctor gave my daughter a prescription for her cough on a saturday and said it will be ready in an hour at the pharmacy
dr dechaine and her staff are terrible
ive been going to her for over a year now and i will never go to anyone else
i feel better and ready to take on whatever life hands me
she broke hipaa laws by disclosing my private information in front of others
dr selco gave us hope when nothing seems possible
said they would immediately talk to the la
although the sign says use your spa voice that didnt matter

each appointment is worst than the last and im officially done with this place
i was told by dr adam the owner that i would have my guard in 23 weeks
she had to have surgery with him and he was really patient with her and made her experience so much better
the change rooms were nice but were darkin the basement and could use a tidy
i was fuming
now that i read the other reviews i see not too many people are happy with the service from this store
everyone was so welcoming and helpful
dont go here if you want help
the next time i go in the woman tells me i owe a copay from a previous visit i couldnt understand why so she got billing on the phone to tell me because you spoke about possible complications at delivery
dr chopra is a great doctor but his front office staff are very rude
two days after i finished the steroid the rash returned
dr cristy prescribes the best supplements for you as well
acupuncture has started to work on issues i have had for years and medicine could not resolve it
i checked their reviews and so many people said positive things so it definitely reassured me
laura the hygienist is amazing with him
he told me that once someone comes in that person is considered a patient that is their policy
been here for 2 hours havent seen a doctor
in ihr rentersprudel reinpinkeln knnte
did the mylogram came back  he said our only option was surgery mind you my husband had anterior cervical fusion on 4 levels in 2007 so we were not jumping into another surgery just like that
the results i achieved were absolutely amazing
the front office really did an amazing job in being able to work with my schedule
wanted a quick fix and yelp recommended this place for a cheap massage
shepherd eye center is the handsdown best ophthalmology practice in the city
i highly recommend they are professional and have healing hands
i am from california and was on vacation when i had the flare up it was painful and needed treatment immediately
the staff n patients deserve it
my friend had a deep tissue from michelle  said she was awesome as well
i had my beast augmentation done on november 18th and i have loved every second of having them
in reality the cancer had completely taken over his spine and he was incapable of even trying to walk
upon arriving i was greeted by the receptionist who i must say was very nice
its a very sobering and humble moment
i wish he could have just nodded and smiled instead of insisting time after time that id eventually get medicine and reciting percentages of people who do
who does that
i also seen the other dentist there and he is just as wonderful as dr devore
my teeth are good and no issues that he saw
however it turns out that he could
this practice has new technology to make your experience much more comfortable
their own words not mine
this place is awesome
hope you have good insurance because copays for specialist followups when you never actually see a specialist can be spendy
he said no thanks well go somewhere else thank you
they fixed his arm and sent him home
i must admit i was nervous about the procedure
he has been treating me for high cholesterol which i have been diagnosed with for over 20 years
getting desperate as my mouth was a mess i looked on the internet under fear of the dentist and found out that craigentinny were having a open night which i decided to attendnot only was there fear i was also very embarresed with the state of my teeth
will be coming here more for any dental work
i called the office and was told by he answering service that an on call doctor would call me back
it felt like forever though because they have one small tv in the corner no magazines nothing except blank walls to look at
i am a talker and she listened and answered all my  questions and was very sweet to us
i have aetna silver open choice ppo
i dont know
he tried to school me on how antibiotics dont work after just one dose uhh i said he was on his 3rd dose and he kept saying the wrong drug i told him he was on and that my expectations were too high and i needed to go home and keep giving him the med
he definitely delivered
also they currently have a great offer for your cleaning exam and xrays which i am sure you noticed if you got this far in reading the yelp review page so if youre on the fence about an office choose this one
i knew making a visit here would be the perfect kickstart to get back on track and prepare me for a summer body
all the nail technicians do an excellent job
his staff is friendly and professional
they listen which is son nice at a medical office
i highly recommend dr inga
i called customer service at 930 in the morning and they sent and email message to the clinic with a message to call me and why
then they did my partial dentures in about 4 appointments
in fact i dont even think they have one
they told me to call the lab company and they didnt care to even fix it and the lab sent it to collections and it hit my credit report
about 30 minutes later kayla picked up her things and left
dr cheney is amazing
generally my experience with healing hearts has been good
i have been shopping around for a dentist in cu and dean ramsay is by far the best
shauna does great massages
out of desperation i came and saw dr nathan blaton i was impressed with the questions he asked and felt an improvement after our first session
i had very bad experiences when i was younger with a dentist and it stuck with me when i went into this office everyone from office staff to the dentist to the hygienist all understood how i was feeling and made my visit painless and they were compassionate about how i was feeling
i really enjoyed it
office staff is always friendly
i went because i had experienced some recent vision problems
second you are lucky if you see pun intended the doctor for more than 30 seconds
being able to make that transition surrounded by those you love and truly amazing folks to help is invaluable in my book
while in the office with dr shapiro he sent me an email which i was able to check right there thru my cell phone and told us that if we have any questions to feel free to send him an email anytime
taken in right away
made a 200 pm appointment arrived about 15 minutes early
25  now thats worth every penny
i will be returning to walmart where i get my prescription the same day with every visit whether i am a new customer or not
dr timothy came in with a why are you here attitude
it is not that busy probably other people know to go anywhere but here
he is also an expert in homeopathy and uses this approach as well as flower remedies if the muscle testing shows that this is the best approach for the patient
i chose this office based on all the positive yelp reviews
and if you must go there and never ever let them do a procedure on your eye
he is a miracle worker  plain and simple and he brought my miracle to life
1quality of service
i got tattoo removal done here and im on my 3rd session and im seeing it disappear before my eyes
then i thought wth
cvs then offered to send a request to the doctor for a cheaper alternative
fair price even some too low
i highly recommend this office
i really enjoyed my experience at healthy habits
definitely would recommend to anyone looking to get their dog spayedneutered
they said they didnt have a referral even though i sent over a copy myself as did his pediatrician
low back and neck pain is on the mend
i lost my wallet here last month
i have had nothing but positive interactions with the staff and the surgery center
i highly recommend you calling their number so that you could find out what would be the best option for you or your loved ones
5 stars for chef kas and his team
i would definitely come back
thank you dr lopez and thank you to your staff
thank you again tanya and staff
hes funny  friendly  and fast
got what i needed including my eye exam and a new set of contacts
all in one day from my ob check up with dr pope in the am to my physical check up with dr nguyen in the pm experience was smooth and very comfortable
the staff seemed to actually be concerned about my teeth but gradually they kept recommending additional procedures and work that caused me to lose credibility in them
went into nutrition rush after working out at lvac
in the past ive feel i had to gag when getting xrays and the hygienists were quite aggressive
within a month i was off all medications and gained about 40 pounds
customer beware  i would give negative stars if i could
i love the professionalism here and although not a spa you still feel relaxed and comfy
the front desk looked at me like i was crazy when i tipped the girl 25
she is perfect for this role and provided outstanding customer service and a warm personality
i was told by a family friend that this doctors office was a great very professional practice
so next time you need to go to a root canal specialist remember dr tonioli
once clean you will go into your pod
they know their stuff too and what to not mix with what
words cannot describe his attitude his confidence and easy to speak and ask anything manner
imagine my surprise when we were called back almost immediately upon turning our paperwork in
i am greatful to be under her care
so ill never step foot in those offices again after receiving such rude treatment
i only came because my husband has been begging to do a couples massage
she personalizes each appointment to what you need and gives great advice on what she thinks would be good for her clients
i would recommend giving it a shot
i was very impressed with tara and my skin still feels great two weeks since my treatment
convenient and friendly staff what else could you ask for
30 min or less and your out the door depending on health concerns and other additions
i took my fiancee in there last sunday for a 1 12 hour massage
i know that they host kirtans and teach yoga at their inhome studio
disclaimer i did not see a doctor here so i can only review my experience with the staff but they were wonderful
bloom was the first dispensary i ever went to after receiving my medical card
i have to say that being a person who looks a details i was disappointed
i was then taken back to see the dr it was just a few minutes and the dr came in
they are always very accommodating
so glad i stayed
these are only done at the glendale office about a 35 mile one way trip for me
the best experience i have ever had at the dentist
you are on your own if you need anything to help you like a walker a wheelchair or help finding any resources
she returned 8 min later at 317 or so
if i could give mcadams dental six stars i would
the place was clean neat and orderly and the staff was friendly even calling me the night before to make sure all was set to go in the morning
spa ish feel
it was expedient but i would rather bring my money elsewhere
very quick and thorough with the exam
after reading the reviews im glad this all happened probably saved me a huge headache
i wish she leaves this place and get her own clinic
dr matthew is a fabulous dr
i called to schedule an appointment and after probably 30 min the lc on call contacted me and scheduled an appointment the next day
i saw a nurse debbie during my visit who was very nice spunky fun and professional
i ask again about the bloodwork results and one of the ladies behind he desk pulls it out and tells me she cant read them and well have to talk with the doctor
the best dental clinic in town
i would avoid this place and im also going to call the review journal about this place so people are aware
i like going to the dentist so this will definitely be my dentist office from now on
i have now finished my invisalign and i am forever grateful to him and his team for making the process simple and helping me achieve my goal
thank you dr cook
i did not beleive this money sucking dentist and decided to get a second opinion
dr trevor kasden is the optometrist here at costco that my wife has been seeing  for 5 years or so now
sometimes when you go to nice spa places like this you feel like a giant awkward furry beast but never here because everyone is so warm and welcoming
quick easy and usually painless our entire family goes to goodyear smiles
after my hair cut while i was chilling by the fire a friendly staff member next door come over to speak to me about a broken blood vessel i had on my face that joel the barber and i talked about
i often get bored with my workouts
the joint on 7th ave in phoenix is topnotch with friendly staff and excellent chiropractors
i could recommend them any higher  jonathon seiberg and the staff were helpful kind and efficient
get them at your local walmart cheaper
after seeing my results my husband has also undergone laser hair removal treatment
after seeing him in preop i  never saw him again until my followup visit a month later
usually im not excited at all for having my feet touched but next time i will be because this was a great foot massage
i can sit at work without much of an issue
then her nurse came in asking me to fill out a survey for her and i asked is she not coming back anymore because i wanted to talk to her about my anxiety
will deff cont comming back
we have seen many of the docs over time
they were both fantastic
i said  whether the eyes work together to follow an object or when reading
they attempted 2 more times to schedule a hysterectomy
the entire staff is wonderful and dr roles is an excellent chiropractor
love this place
dr thomas confirmed a slight tear in my mcl
you will be here an average of 15 hrs each time you come with about 5 min with a tech and 5 with a pa and the rest is just waiting around
i used to go to this clinic all the time i spent a lot of money over the years and everyone there was always super friendly and nice but now they have made a lot of changes within and the manager is super rude in the massage clinic and does not value their customers
and that is what its like when you walk into gibson orthodontics
long wait times nobody seems to have any direction on how to get people in and out
even though its small ive never seen a line for the bathroom or changing room and ive never seen people waiting longer than 1 or 2 rounds to get into a station
two thumbs up
now after working with ron i am doing swats with up to 75 lbs
she asked questions before she started so that she could zero in on what i wanted
we immediately left
usually the doctors assistants fault
my glasses arrived in a timely manner  are great
no matter what you need done you will absolutely be happy you went to desert hills dental so go put your teeth in their hands
while it may not have been a true side by side couples experience as we were in separate treatment rooms we didnt care we both got awesome massages
i had an abscess tooth
i do not write many yelp reviews but i felt compelled to write about dr verloop
dr rehl is plain awesome in my book
in hindsight the time flew by and i am so glad i made the commitment
in this day and age of chain dentists it was a pleasant surprise
what a waste of money
he lost feeling in it and couldnt really move his hand
i attempted to call in the middle of texting and they still refused to answer they were obviously available to text
i dont take pain meds so er isnt going to help
to me the way she practiced care in my case was extremely dangerous and could have really hurt me long term had i not gone for second opinions and follows ups with other doctors based off the extreme symptoms i was having
the same relaxing feel of a luxurious spa mixed with the skill of a therapist who is incredibly knowledgeable
made an appointment waited 1 hour picked out glasses came to over 50000 and then 3 weeks pass not a call
i explained mayo clinic does not take my insurance  and im still engaged in rehabilitative therapies in home health and would not be able to enroll in this program until i complete my rehabi asked so what help are you offering me today
during my evaluation i was introduced to supplemental wellness and dietary treatment
smells bomb in here tho
the doctor was knowledgeable courteous and friendly
of course multiclass passes drop the price as you buy more classes
im currently on holiday all around the usa and my wisdom tooth decided to come through and give me a lot of grief and become infected over the course of a week
it was clean and bright and was not stuffy like some places are
having been to the majority of reflexology places in the east valley this isnt always the case
making your overall experience worthwhile
and so we began
i would not see this as a negative at all
it starts at the top  with caring administrative staff and can be seen through all levels of the organization
at the end of the 4 weeks they ran my body test again but didnt go over it with me or anything
even after the meds wear offno pain ever
fortunately we have some left over antibiotics around so well skip the dr or go to wallgreens clinic where the wait times are reasonable
her classes are amazing
even sitting in it and trying to scoot did not budge it
this place is amazing
i was really worried about going to the dentist as i have had many bad experiences in the past with dentists who were rude or who billed me for unnecessary procedures
professional and knowledgable
and then i was told to not come back because of missed appointments which is very upsetting
after 10 days the hair started to fallout at the roots
several friends and acquaintances athletes and nonathletes have raved about her work as well
the drainage was removed a week after it was inserted and now my boyfriend feels x10 better
nothing beats good service good social skills professionalism and cleanliness when a girl needs to prep for her wedding
this is me time
so if they are booking up why close early
thank you gp dental for restoring my faith in good old fashioned service and caring for your patients above all else
thats okay and better than nothing  but it  missed the really big payoff of practice which is mental health and happiness
i would not recommend this place
the reason for my 3 star rating
i couldnt be happier with my experience
ever since i moved to phoenix i have seen dr b and she is delightful
i had gone to another dentist and they lied to me screwed me around and treated me like crap but not dr arooni
very rude and uncaring
my billing has been messed up and claims submitted wrong to insurance companies
by the time i get in to be seen my teeth would have shifted as opposed to the position they were in when my braces first came off and when they take the impressions they will be impressions of my teeth after they shifted and permanently my teeth will stay that way because my teeth will shift in 3 days
she tried to lift my right ear local shot in her office and it didnt help
now i leave their office satisfied and painfree
she obviously knows nothing about the company and shouldnt be an employee
he was always careful that i was comfortable in each of my adjustments
funny i live and work in mesa but enjoy the professional and pleasant atmosphere of this office
he is very humble and wont tell you this but i found out he is one of the top top no
checking out the girl with no noticeable expression asked if i enjoyed my experience
after the exam i had to speak to the manager who lets you know how much the bill will be after your insurance coverage
just had rather major surgery with dr scholes  it was a procedure on my gums i really did not think i needed but my dentist recommended it
not painful enough that i was asking for mercy but not wonderful enough to have me shouting gloria
i was calling to see on how the so called membership was billed and to see if it would be covered by my flexible spending account
i protested and explained to them i was told i would be receiving the cleaning the same day
furthermore when i called the receptionist to order my contacts over the phoneshe was very rude and said that i would have to schedule a second appointment to order them
they have appointment times that seem to be flexible with scheduling and ifwhen you call when they are closed you are routed to someone who can help you with scheduling maybe a contracted service
my dentist agreed that i should have my root canal done elsewhere and i was referred to a different endodontist who was significantly better
i was slightly bothered because in my experiences with other dental offices i know what i have to pay up front for services
we need more people like her in the world
not charged the 75 dollars so assume it was being treated as a continuation of earlier visit
i have zero pain tolerance and recently went in to have all four of my wisdom teeth taken out
i went to rio and i could tell that they really prepared to deal with young children who might be reluctant to get their teeth cleaned
i had dr mary ann and she gave me my new patient exam and  provided me with a very detailed evaluation and treatment plan
i had to do a random work drug test  routine procedure
we were both in a daze and had no idea who this woman was but she introduced herself and proceeded to tell us off
further making me feel like he cares about us clients
great ramen  great service
expect your mouth to get really dry but its only for a short time
you can definitely do better than this guy
drshah is the worst obgyn i have ever seen
i immediately called michelle she put dr rowe right on
i cant say enough about it and will be greatful for all they did
today steven gave me an incredible stretching session with fascial release techniques
we hit it off right away
i previously reviewed this business after i got treated in 2013  the review was on yelp for quite awhile i believe at least till this past april before it disappeared
i also never felt rushed
i heard them say to each other that its store credit
although i may be harsh with my reviews i tell the truth and have not lied about a single thing written here
dr parker and his team are fantastic
i began to cry and told them how awful the experience was and tammy at the front desk just said that there was nothing she could do becasue she is not clinical
as a team they are dynamic and complement each other so well
unfortunately the antibiotic was too strong for me and i could not finish it
he was caring and listened and even asked about my husband
overall the experience was great and the results were even better
when they emailed me the bill they had reinstated discounts that the prior dentist had given
i have seen great results from her work already
i was thrilled
i signed up online and received an email confirmation that i had signed up with the studio
they have also been very accommodating with my schedule
when i went to ask for help they told me at one location i wouldnt have to pay for their mess up
like most people i cant just leave work whenever i want i have to get permission from a supervisor in advance
the place was terribly markedan obvious sign that they r egotistical shows with their signage
so i am supposed to endure this on tylenol uhmmm chewing my own leg off would be less painful
warning this thing was a rocket so please take your time learn the speed settings
i will definitely go back and refer people
i dont know how long into the session it was but she accused me of moving when i didnt
save yourself the trouble  find another drs office
we have asked them how much longer 3 times and they keep saying your next and now 7 people have gone back
all in all the people there i do no like
great prices and product but lousy customer service and education
they sent me to another lab for my tests
i had always fantasized about stepping out on stage for a fitness competition but i never thought that i wouldve been able to accomplish such a feat
dr casalino and dr harris are amazing at what they do and anna is the cherry on top when arriving and departing
i have routinely been coming every 6 months for cleanings and have had a few fillings done with no complaints
very friendly too
dr biggs and staff are very welcoming and they actually listen to your concerns and address all questions
i figured 200per pair of glasses isnt too bad after all i also bought contacts
they have that too
she is great
well target is what it is another massive chain that looks and feel like a tidy organized version of zellers
the computer thing dug in under my tongue and left sores but i guess thats how its done now
they tried to decorate it and make it look nice but for some reason it just doesnt seem very inviting
i wonder why im not the only patient that has given a negative review
i told her my back was in a lot of pain and she continue to be rough on me i couldnt wait till the massage was over
if i owed this store i would fire all of them
and the third one was a half cardio half weight class that i just loved it so much
we were overwhelmed by the immediacy and urgency of the situation trying to research programs in and out of state and battling with the insurance company
i highly recommend their business
dr clark is by far the best chiropractor in the valley
hey i have a husband who hasnt had a job since february
plenty of new dispensaries to try
he was made comfortable not scared at all and got the gas which i think helped a lot
this is a lovely facility with a lovely receptionist
i shouldnt have waited
the time i spent to write this is to make this point
matt taught the midday hot vinyasa flow and i couldnt have been more pleased with my experience
brooklyn was the hygienist who did my xrays and cleaning and she did a wonderful job
he tries to misrepresent what traditional doctors do and claims he can do not only better but cure you
you will like it
the hygienist took some xrays and did a great job cleaning my teeth
whenever i mentioned a rough spot dr miller polished it out  he did not complain about my sensitivity and the fact that i really needed some extra polishing  i suppose i have a sensitive tonguemouth
sometimes even if i disagree with somebody i look to see how they think to get a better idea of their reasoning ability and its clear that dr kim has excellent critical thinking skills which should come as no surprise if you see his credentials one could argue they are second to none
best group fitness studio in the city
never been here before and deja walked us through everything
there are always lines to check out
they kept trying to get us to upgrade
i have gone there several times in the last few years for exams or if i needed birth control and didnt have insurance at the time
im most annoyed i drove there  wasted my time and the worst thing is i should have known better  any dentist with windows overlooking the beautiful ambiance of the carls jr parking lot cant be that good can it
she apologized and reluctantly gave me my 10 change
this healthcare partners are really a scam artists
i can also see that he really hates to keep people waiting he is not above apologies when needed
if by the grace of god a miracle happens and it looks the way it should i will remove this review but i seriously doubt it
dr singh discussed all aspects of my cataract surgerythe best outcome and the worst outcome
well that saturday came and went and i forgot all about the appt
dr burke was cheerful and positive which made it a wonderful experience
there were two patients ahead of us and it only took the doctor 30 minutes to see my 8 month old
she let the fellow check me first and she came back after they call her
my sons primary doctor is dr sotelo but ive spoke to all of the doctors here and i couldnt be more happy with trusting my sons health in their care
she was rushing to get out of the room and told me i could see someone else because the problem is my central processor
i will never come back to this place and hopefully no body does either
i think ive had 4 hygienists here and all but one have been personable and gentle
and this place had one of the best chashus ive ever had
in addition to acupuncture dr craig also performs cold laser therapy great for sports injuries and cupping
she really tells things how they are and does not hold back
i paid a lot of money for lashes that fell out within a week
it was almost 11 pm when he checked himself out against their recommendation
i asked considering the circumstances of the first miscommunication if they would just mail me the lenses they refused so i got a little rude with them
but my lower back was killing me and i needed help
i am never going back here again
and believe  me i get alot of massages and her massage was  therapeutic  and relaxing
delivered my twins at this hospital via a scheduled csection
i swear i look years younger
for starters i was kind of bummed when my husband switched jobs and my former eye doctor did not accept our new vision insurance
i mean thats why we are all here right
i am never over pushed but challenged just enough to keep me improving
since then dr chuang moved her practice from the seven hills location to her current location on horizon ridge and i been with her ever since
i hate businesses that conduct themselves like this
the atmosphere and technology far exceed my expectations
apparently we were scheduled as new patients since we were new to dr kaplan
i always find it hard to find a massage therapist that uses the right pressure but patrizia was able to keep a mediumdeep pressure throughout the whole 60 minutes
spent 4 days at st josephs and i absolutely love them since ive found out i was pregnant i was recommended to the 500 building for ob visits first time here the receptionist and staff were very nice and friendly
that was a nice waste of time
spencer meier pac was fantastic
i wish restaurants would follow this practice lol
thank you for making me feel comfortable when i felt vulnerable
i dont have to go to the dermatologist often but every time i do see dr pehoushek i leave saying to myself i need to tell everyone i know about this doc  hes the best

then theresa came in and did my exam
he communicated to us the necessary information  even played with my 14 month daughter before he left the exam room

after not hearing back from them for over 2 weeks i decided to check reviews and look for another doctor
he does his continuing education and research and knows the newest things despite the fact that he is a family doctor with a very busy practice
she gave me a coupon to save 100 on each kids first visit
im so disappointed that we have such a nice new facility to get urgent care during after hours but now that i know what to expect i would not recommend anyone going there unless its the last resort
he uses headphones with music and guided meditations during the treatment
dr prettyman is great
its been difficult to get proper information with a dr that suddenly doesnt care and is just filing his patients through like cattle so he can make his money and probably get back to research

she didnt even want to hear my complaint she cut me off telling me its was to late to cancel that my credit card would still be charged
dentist and staff have been very professional informative and friendly
when i call to ask about it im told well it looks like we forgot to bill your insurance for some of the services rendered that day so youre going to need to take care of the balance
dr clay forsberg is simply fabulous
the wait was not too bad and i usually have issues with my blood pressure being taken by anyone
i recently went for a general optometry appointment and found dr price very nice and knowledgable
i will be appealing the exorbitant fees with my insurance company who are to blame as well as they should not list this facility as an urgent care provider
this establishment is the best thing that has ever happened to me

he is warm professional and very detail oriented
she spoke with me about a couple of major pitfalls of purchasing eyewear online  that the pdpupillary distance is usually inaccurate and that the center of the lens is unnoticed with online eyewear purchases  they create the lens in a generic way even though the center of vision isnt usually symmetricalparallel for both eyes
went home defeated but later got a text from a friend its behind 2 hrs i chuckled called and made an appointment for the 19th ave location
would highly recommend her
if i had the money i would sent my mommy getting my d cups was the best 43rd birthday gift to myself
the customer service here is top notch and something i have never experienced anywhere else
whereas ill come here that little bit panicked as and when i need something urgently
after multiple phone calls and messages not returned i was given the number of the customer relations manager sonya
however the long wait and their inability to deliver glasses when promised makes it difficult to shop here
this guy is a real piece of work
i was recommended to horizon eye specialist and had 4 appointments to prepare for my surgery
if you are looking for a doctor with integrity and great skills stop right here
i did physical therapy and pain management for a while
my doctor was going to make me wait another month for my next ultrasound
throughout the years the waiting time got longer and longer
i highly recommend this place
i started off with a simple eye brow wax and i couldnt stop
this store has such good vibes
several other nurses who came in to see our daughter during the visit at cardon remarked that they were surprised that that particular wrap was used too
i found a pair of raybans that he didnt have and asked for pricing
a little heads up for anyone choose to go to this clinic for family doctor in the future
children are now allowed to visit patients and residents
large selection of glasses to choose from
its nothing like a zoolike open floor other practices i had visited
i feel confident and empowered as a mother with tracys plan because i know it is good for him
dr lind did not even examine my sons foot and flippantly stated id like to see you get some more wear out of these
very unprofessional office staff
cant believe i had been putting off my teeth cleaning for so long
also the office staff needs to verify your email address and let you know that you will be sent and email from them and mention that if you do not receive the email within the next day to call them backbecause likely the person who does intake likely forgot to ask for the email address or wrote it down incorrectly
i have been going to dr shirleys dental practice for a few years now after many more years of unsatisfactory service with previous dentists
i anticipated having to have a lot of work done but he examined me and told me i was likely grinding my teeth in my sleep
the doctors and medical assistants were sweet and caring
he simply looked very briefly at the spot of concern and provided topical samples
i had been instructed to start pain medication in the morning
later in the day my brother noticed upon bag change that the stiches were ripped and excrement was coming through the new tear not the stoma itself
my daughter also works with jamie who is very serious about her work cares about her patients and is also personable
pa marlina robinson is a straight shooter who tells it like it is
this is an awful place
i cant do that again
if i could give dr hanian negative stars i would
i have to live in pain in that calf area
i will not come back due to the bad quality bad service and bad attitude that i got
what does that have to do with me
this place sucks donkey balls
such an unorganized facility
just like ralph m you will not get the warm and fuzzies from this pt
received nonrx drops anyway
ask lots of questions and get a second opinion
i called my insurance before my appointment and they informed me my exam would be covered with no co pay
extreme knowledge blended with compassion have made my experience beyond words amazing
i am beyond furious
the staff was very friendly and helpful
ill not return
still loved the ambience and the free beveragestreats
me barely able to breathe and husband hoping we will make it to the er before i pass out
she had a very negative attitude towards any of my ideas and actually told me that if i wanted a dr to help me than i should let the dr help me
i felt obligated to come home and share my story i also have all the estimates in writing and will be complaining formally to the dentist board
the staff was very friendly and got us in very quickly
i found deja vu when i was searching online for spa
as a result i have found myself getting sick rather easily
anything could happen
all im saying is if youre going to offer a patient a drink you should offer it to every patient that walks in
why am i charged for only half the year
i personally also  like that it doesnt look like a head shop inside just vape juiceequipment
when the doctor saw in my facial gestures that im fucked and pissed he was like i wish there was more i could do and started laughing
its hard to really describe how it feels but something you have to try at least once in your lifetime or once a month if you are me  the staff was welcoming  attentive
at 1st no wayeveryone is with patients and i finally said im a patient  i have an appt
that changed this week
theres a totally new staff mostly hispanic women and you can tell that theyre already on edge  trying to figure out how is this going to work
i think the package was 75 regularly and an extra 45 for the hd so 120 total insurance isnt accepted but as a first time parent you want to get a peek at your baby as much as you can
i wouldve said something but i was actually thankful it was over
when i get there the product i asked about was not sold to me because i do not have a card
he then looks into my sons ears having a hard time i then put my son on my lap  held him in a bear hug while dr shapiro looked again after a couple of attempts my son lets out a blood curdling cry that i have only heard a few times in his life
i will not refer anyone to them and share my customer experience to everyone i know family and friends and post my experience in all my personal social media outlets because that is how annoyed i am with this dental office
where the staff overbooks appointments and is totally disengaged with their customers
second time the doctor jennifer gresham fnpc gives me attitude because im telling her what im concerned about she say i can only take care of this 3 things mind you i was here yesterday for those 2 things so i had to come back today
im so relaxed now
its worth the first time float of 50 or whatever deal you can findpromotion they run
this office is so dysfunctional
dr thompson is a great optometrist and incredibly knowledgeable and professional
a few times i have strayed from the regular doctor i see in this office and i always end up going back to her but at this point anymore i think i will be looking for a new doctors office as this office just doesnt seem to be the right fit for me
i spent a few hours there getting my dad situated and i told everyone about his condition
no reason not to treat me
the next day i noticed a charge for 145 dollars on my checking account
thank you drhoban
bikram yoga tempe is a beautiful clean friendly place to do yoga
and most importantly there should either be a special instructions area or a way in which to email this company
thank you to all of the staff in the emergency room for all that you did to make my son comfortable after dislocating his knee today
she always available for advice or to answer any questions that i may have
and the people at walmart were so much nicer than anyone at lenscrafters has ever been to me
everyone who goes to this gym is so nice and accepting and we all have different levels of fitness
i had to go to the er at sunrise recently and was diagnosed treated and released in under 3 hours
she finishes all the other prep measurements and says the doctor will be in soon
best dentist office around
in and out in a reasonable amount of time with my prescription in hand
she looked at xrays i had done at my previous appointment 6 months prior
the joint is really working for me
i have been a patient for a little under 1 year now due to employer insurance change in coverage
for me it is worth the forty minute drive down to chandler to continue going to az family dentistry they provide excellent reliable care
the surgery went great on both feet
this is my go to place for quick medical issues
my insurance would cover a yearly exam but when i buy two pairs of glasses here its waived anyways
they took me back approximately 30  hour in to see an assistant who went over my issueeye sight check and then headed me back to the waiting area
it was very concerning to me that i was diagnosed with nerve damage but they were not willing to review my xray with me
thanks you dr pease and staff  for a wonderful experience and taking away some of the anxiety of going to the dentist
she didnt not respond
i needed a tooth filled that had a filling fall out
lots more patients seeing dr pardee now
everyone we had the pleasure of interacting with was very friendly and knowledgeable
a company who are so ruthless financially that they are willing to throw you to collections years after an event to make a dollar or two
suzi and i connected right away
yeah the punctuality is more than appreciated
after waiting an hour past my appointment time when i went to reschedule they attempted to cancel me as a no show when i said id have to reschedule do to waiting so long
we never feel like were being rushed out the door
he genuinely cares
he will not take anything but checks or cash and you can still file your insurance claims but if you dont have it he is very reasonable with his pricing
this time i felt like i was in a cattle prod
i hate to see the negative reviews of the office staff but please dont let who checks you in determine if he checks you out
i have never in my 26 years had such a fabulous experience at a dentists office from start to finish
i also had zero idea of how intense this surgery would be until meeting him and his staff
definitely talk to her about essential oils as therapytreatment too
only downside is the long wait time on ct scans and mris
i dont know his name but we was wearing some type of wrap on his head
so i was recommended to this place by my obgyn i gave them a call an set an appointment for a monday
yvonne went above  beyond to explain what i needed to do during the mri to get the best results
ich sass dann fiebrig und fantasierend  15 bis 2 stunden im wartezimmer
finally i left my room and went up to the front desk to notify them
finally saw lilys posting and the first thing i noticed was soooo many reviews
a pleasure to go
when i tried see dr my spouse saw was told i couldnt change doctors and the girl then hung up on me
very personal care
very pleased with the experience
the male employee is great
they said it was going to be 250
the entire staff is very friendly  and they all have a good sense of humor so in addition to quality pt you can get some good laughs too
i take your time and ride as my one concern
i had no mouth pain but definitely needed some work
never coming back here
i actually chose this place even though my insurance didnt cover the invisalign treatment because i was confident in the execution of their plan based on the service that i received from the start
lida the hygienist was very friendly
the fees were not what were advertised through cigna
i highly recommend a facial by carmen
my total time during my visit with a pa or doc was 1015 mins
great service no guilt trips thorough cleaning and you go home with a cute little gift bag of nice floss lip balm toothpaste and toothbrush
the average number of years for anyone that works at this establishment is 12 years of experience
truly makes you feel like family and not just a number
i have not been sleeping well lately so this was such a treat to feel so relaxed that i was able to take a nap
the prices were unreal
my daughter was frantic and crying
another time i called in for an appointment and they hung up on me twice and attributed to the person being new again
the lady who did my facial was very good and asked about my life and we chatted and then she let me relax as she proceeded with the facial she also included a nice neck and arm massage
was i told ahead of time of course not
highly recommend this location
the dr and pa are awesome but the front desk people suck
i like the office is so clean and up to date with technology
prior to the visit i was nervous about how my little one would react however the whole staff made it enjoyable for her
no talking at all after this
i get so many compliments and couldnt be happier
it is a great opportunity to take some group exercise classes without having to commit to joining a gym
valley is the best
i have my favorite therapists at each place and ill schedule my sessions around my work and family life
i moved my home there and sold it to escape
throughout my pregnancy he made sure that i thoroughly understood the risks associated with attempting a vaginal delivery after having gone through a csection in my prior delivery
i have tried every hair removal option on the planet and this is by far the best
his staff was informative and very friendly
the little things that topped it off
our son was brought back and i noticed how clean and modern the patient area seemed
also for helping me find the source of pain from past trauma both physically and emotionally not just treating the symptoms but helping me in finding the cause
i definitely will use evdi again
dr huang doesnt listen
the two times i have come here for service
what a pleasant experience from the first person at the desk to everyone who treated me
he is very professional and i had no problems making an appointment
hes even told us when therapy was not needed
i will post this review wherever i can since i feel that this is part of my repayment to dr chow for a surgery  that went above expectation
i have informed bbb and will be informing the hospital staff my doula facebook as well as other moms who plan to use this company if this isnt resolved
still waiting outside the door at 730am
oh yea if you have a problem call this lady jami7022192311
i liked it now its just too far out of the way to visit
in and out within the hour
i went to dr guillen as a new patient bc my previous dentist of 12 years had recently dropped my insurance
the doctor was great and really made me feel comfortable
i will do a little update to this review once i go back for my crown later this month
i actually look forward to going to the dentist  imagine that
the prices are extremely reasonable and i never feel pressured to get add ons
you will never feel like you are just another person to get in and out when you visit
the entire process was easy professional and pleasant
dr webber is uneducated and insensitive when it comes to nursing mothers
ive been going to see scott miner at omni chiropractic for several years
the receptionist was super friendly and greeted me by my first name apparently they dont jam pack appointments and can keep track of whos coming in nice touch
i have insurance so they took my card and said theyd bill me later if something wasnt covered
what helps is you put baby oil in your ears one week before you get your ear wax removed
it took well over an hour to get a basic hand xray done
then the guy backed off and gave him an antibiotic
kudos to the quick action and excellent care
i could feel the therapeutic air enter my lungs which each purposeful breath and the 45min session left me with salty lips and a fine dew of salt on my clothing and exposed belongings
i was kind of nervous thinking maybe the doctor missed something
i only wish i could have them move here to los angeles
although i have mild adult acne i declined his offer since the creams and antibiotics have only ever been a temporary fix for me and ive learned to live with the skin ive been given
i knew that each treatment was 98 and the first visit alone was 240
as far as how often i will return the prices here are about 1520 more than other foot spas in the area and that can be a huge factor when budgeting in bimonthly massages
i gave them a one page synopsis of what i had been through and what didnt work
and yes this place is great
they were giving my mother morphine eight times a day  every three hours
dr mismas is a wonderful dentist who not only takes the time to speak with you about every concern but also makes it fun to be there
then 15 minutes ago that digihelper said there was no one in front of me and yet no real person has answered the phone
health benefits are infinite
assured me we would get this taken care of following my comprehensive exam  cleaning
do not make the same mistake as i did and go to that other building
the coordination was simple enough and quite honestly drama less
compassionate and capable flexible and friendly this office has it all
the office called 2 times the days before to confirm my appointment which i did
he made me feel like a human being as opposed to a nuisance and was kind and understanding
i did a bit of research and discovered that 4mm and above are considered appropriate depths to prescribe the scaling procedure
both times  staff was very friendly  cheerful and professional
i told the gentlemen i was only their for the promotion and only wanted what was included he went on to tell me they were unfashionable frames to let him show me some other options i again refused but at his third at bat i gave in at the end i still went with the original frames i had picked
making the appointment was a painful experience
i have already recommend this practice to several friends and will continue to do so at any opportunity
ive felt overly watchedinspected and maybe a little judgednot sure exactly but its theremaybe they think im a snob
very inviting atmosphere
elles meal plan is not a crazy starving diet but a flexible tool
they have free parking for starters
i went in with a broken tooth
great competenton time health care
he was very careful in his process
my last peds office was wonderful
each moving part works together to take care of patients from head to toe inside and out
had dental implant surgery today wonderful job
ive been here twice now for my yearly eye exam
you get to choose the length and it goes up to 16 mm if i remember right
for any out of pocket supplies i will be calling him
listen people if you need an amazing chiropractor you need to check these guys out
plus if you need a deep cleaning that means you have deep tarter and they cant do a simple cleaning it requires more work and more time and yes it costs extra
the pa consistently asks what brought you in
before my eyelid drooped i would not have gone back or recommended her
find any place else to go
i think the hour and a half wait was beyond ridiculous
luckily it wasnt as expensive as i thought
i dont understand the point in making an appt if i have to way well past the time of my appt anyway
and i said yes
i asked them to book me on july 25th monday at 4pm at green valley location
i saw dr cummings for pain in my elbow
we both had the foot deluxe but the massage is a whole body experience for 40 dollars that you do not want to miss
dont be like me and wait way to long in severe pain just call on dr josh because he can and will help
i know this dental office is very popular and now i know why
they also accept walkins so i know theyll be there whenever i need a last minute visit to a doctor
perhaps it was her having the bad day and not the dentist she claims shes heard many people dentists and regular folk make statements
this office is so much more than a chiropractic office
i never heard back after 3 weeks so i called on march 10th christine said they were back ordered and thought it could be a couple more weeks when i reminded her about the 35 days and also usually no more than 2 weeks she said she would look into and call me the next day
the lady was super nice even though there was a small language barrier and made me feel so relaxed and comfortable
they would have delivered it to us free if we had called a day ahead but we went to pick it up saving15
the one i liked was damaged during install of the lenses a replacement frame was not available because this line was discontinued
my gums did not even hurt
im flying back to denver tomorrow and it will be all on my dad to see that she gets proper care
they were shameless i almost felt embarrassed for the hygienists
by far the best chiropractic office ive been to and ive been to too many to count
i was blown away by all the positive and decided to purchase the packages and make the appointment
ive never had to visit a chiropractor in my lifeknock on wood nor have i ever had an adjustment before but ive seen wifey go through a couple of sessions
i aint gotta take this
just wanted to relax after trying for 2 days to get them to respond now shes trying to fleece me
my experience at mihs includes seeing a gp specialist visits and seeing the dermatologist
scheduled surgery to reattach the tendon for the next day and bam  i was out of there
any question or concern i had was addressed quickly and professionally
this was my first plastic surgery procedure and i am very satisfied with the results and care i recieved
dr licata himself is really really wonderful at what he does and definitely seems to enjoy being a dentist
dr malik is great at what he does
i spent only 2 weeks with this practice and decided that i would rather live with debilitating pain than continue any sort of pain managementtreatment with these people
i told him i did not want to go back to dr ziegler
recreational marijuana starts soon
so i would flinch and pull my foot when it hurt but he still didnt get the hint
i got shushed one too many times and then the incompetent doctor threatened me with security
my insurance company is currently investigating
our experience with him has been no different he is professional kind informative and takes his time with each appointment
i will not be going back
i recommend dr paul to anyone that is in need of a chiropractor or just wants an adjustment
this place is a jokeu bunch of fucking immigrants0l working there who have no experience working in the healthcare field
her response appointment
im still waiting for labs zero movement zero communication from staff regarding delay
i had to juggle work and the appointment
she did a lash lift on me and i love it
the office is very comfortable and the tv in which i had full reign of the remote made my four hour appointment go by very quickly
i gave her my information as well regarding my insurance and specifically asked if they were in network for my vsp plan which i was told that they were
this is unheard of
showed up on time  which was important
she then looked at my daughters ears and listened to her chest
nice competent friendly professional people
i wish i could give dr rothman and staff more than 5 stars
stopped by here with some strep throat
i went and had my surgery elsewhere yet because i trusted butler i came back to her for hormone replacement
where to begin
i saw wendy the np for the first time and she was great
my oldest charlotte is 14 and will be out of braces with a movie star smile
not a good way to end a relaxing massage
i delivered here in 2013 and absolutely loved it
i also spotted a security guard driving around but he clearly did nothing about the people loitering everywhere
he explained what he was doing and how much longer i had to wait before i could relax
2 sessions later and i am almost back to normal
i decided to check it out and take advantage of their 45 for 60 min promo
first off when we started trying to get pregnant we went and interviewed 3 obs and decided on iacovelli because of her location personality and she delivers at chandler regional with mercy gilbert being a backup
coco was my massage therapist
overall my experience with total sports medicine and orthopedics staff members and dr yu has been outstanding
i initially liked this place
i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for chiropractic help
i definitely recommend nurse brandie at dj vu  shes friendly professional listens and gets great results
karen years later still means the world to us for all these reasons and more
he quickly began very condescendingly mind you telling me to go to walmart
yesterday was our first appointment at chamberlain orthodontics and my son was nervous
everyday is different and so much fun and energy
run dont walk to get chiropractic help here
so looking forward to ending my membership to this gym
once we arrived we immediately thought this was a bad place to be
warning it should be noted that your iq may be lowered merely upon stepping foot in this facility
shannon is truly a professional she heard what i said and wanted listened intently so she was able to identify the tools i need to help me achieve the results i told her i wanted to get out of our sessions
its been a long time coming but since i started seeing dr a more than half a decade ago my skin has finally cleared up for the most part
not my fault you didnt get it preapproved
they take the time to explain product and recommendations have been spot on
worth every penny in my wallet
in my case the return on investment has been substantial
he is an amazing human being and a very skilled professional
thank you dr b
more than that the dentist is a bitch
i came back because my liquid stitches i received at the same location came off after less than 48 hours theyre supposed to stay on 510 days
my girlfriend introduced this place to me
when you do finally get seen the appointment is about 510 minutes long
when i got in to see him he took my concerns very seriously and sat with me and my husband in his office to go over possible reasons and preventions
i was told that without checking with my insurance that was the best estimate they could give me
got treated like a princess and i recommend that everyone stop by and check out their many treatments i know ill be back for sure
i have no desire to be treated like that again
and i love that he lets his sister put her mark stuff in his office
enjoy feeling better and watching yourself improve
my husband had a horrible experience w them so we wont be back
when i call back in the second time to get a follow up on whats going on
i was recommended by a friend to go to melanie and honestly she was great
the staff was great and really made me feel comfortable and at ease
when i thought she was done with the massage the therapist reclined the chair further and asked me to turn over onto my stomach
id say hes comparable to the world renowned doctors my husband saw in maryland
i went to the studioshop a couple of days prior to my appointment to check out the place and fortunately also got to meet vic
massage in the heart of danville
nita nannys office manager called me right back to confirm they could meet our lastminute sitter needs
i guess im thankful a little that my boyfriend at the time was a total ass and bought me the services but i couldnt afford to pay for any of it myself
she has a great sense of humor and it wonderful at what she does
i just want to say dr moody is great even if i move again ill travel to keep him as my dentist
my wife had emergency small intestine blockage and the emergency room and hospital were superb
after receiving final parting words i was quickly on my way
the hours available for appointments are great for working parents and kids in school
i sent a complaint about the whole experience to the main office because i was completely disappointed and they sent me a generic email back about how much they care and will look into the incident
the office was familyoriented and in a convenient location
dr knapp pam and kylie were all wonderful
dr karawi and his office staff are just wonderful
we had gone through every permutation of helping her to sleep bedsharing crib in the room crib sidecarwhen i started working with hannah my husband had been sleeping on the floor of my daughters room for 3 weeks trying to gently coach her to sleep
a head nurse ended up bringing my daughter back to life and got her the oxygen that she needed and for the most part the nick you was very nice there was only one nurse that was very rude she was very strict didnt want to let me see my baby when i did go visit her the security guard had a german shepherd with him that almost bit me
i cant thank hannah enough
going though physical therapy with them and its been great so far
this place is awful
she has no vested interest in the decisions you make so she doesnt try to persuade you to do or not do anything
also all of his staff are friendly and kind
when he arrived the receptionist was very rude and condescending to my son because he didnt have a card did not know his deductible  i am 47 years old and have never once been asked by my dentist what my deducible for dental was  when my son apologized and stated he was sorry and that this was the first time he had his own insurance which had just become valid january 2017 she tossed his paperwork at him and said she did not have time for this
the rmt listed on the invoice is not registered with cmto so they fabricated a persons name and a fake cmto registration number
i could not walk for a month and its been 8 months now and my knee is still horrible i am getting my second mri today i ve gone to tons of doctors and other physical therapists i don t know what he did to my knee but he screwed up it really bad
from my first call to set an appointment they were so friendly and made sure i got the most from my insurance
he analyses your face so well that the results are very symmetrical and subtle that the end result is a refresh younger look
go find a different dental office
im eventually going to have to go to florida to fight this but in the meantime want to save my fellow yelpers from having to go through what i am with this
the consults last 3040 minutes
in the nearly 12 months they have been caring for my mom i have been extremely impressed with the personal and loving care his staff has provided
it has been a life changer for me
well last night i went for the first time and i was pleasantly surprised
what a special doctor
i dont want to hear moans and groans from other people
if i lived in chandler i would stay with them this place had way to many people it felt like i was a cow in a slaughter house
i was standing at the window for 10 minutes while one of the nurses were yelling at her employees
look forward to a followup
got a foot bath and a sinus massage then an intense  and much needed  foot massage then turned into a more standard massage of the neck and back
the spa owner would not call me she refused to speak with me
to alleviate my muscle tension trigger points and stress inna did a combination of deep tissue and relaxation massage
didnt tell me to take a seat and didnt tell me how long the wait would be
within a few days i received the parts which appear new and functions perfectly
but once we started learning a few tricks had our drinks close at hand we all got into it
not to mention the old ladies that act like over zealous security guards
dr wong in the group here are great
i now see an actual doctor who thinks ims is cutrate
i definitely plan on staying with smile right
worth checking out if youre in the area
he ended up dropping me off in the optical center to pick out and try on reading glasses at 1
the front desk clerks were friendly and quick to greet me
i have had several incidents with paperwork or lack thereof  a lack of followup on insurance issues and they schedule too many patients too close together  because he is involved in his patients  gives everyone attention this can lead to long wait times
i had mikki as my aesthetician she was really great
highly reccomend this place
good job guys
she gives you results and is very affordable
the massage table is nice and the warmers are great
i would not recommend using this practice unless you want to pay a lot of money and deal with people who are irresponsible and are more concerned about making a buck rather than provide good customer service
very friendly staff and incredibly clean facility
and im a sahm
i am simply a happy patron and i will be back in six months
i should have yelped them before my first visit
got the bill today399 for 10 minutes
keeping that in mind dr troche is great he makes you feel safe and taken care of
the staff is outstanding when it comes to accommodating to your comfort
he severed three fingers and was rushed here for surgery
completely screw up your appointments
i left this dentist clinic almost a year ago
i think it might have something to do with the temperature she keeps her wax but whatever it may be it works
there was a reason why
my 3rd and last visit today 0827 my appt was scheduled for 1115 i arrived 10 minutes early for my appt and upon checking in the front counter lady advised me that the dr was running 20 min behind and said that i shouldnt be waiting as long as last time
i like a chiropractor who feels hisher way to what needs to be done with my body
please stay away from him
i will no longer be a patient at that shit hole of an office
i cannot believe how difficult it was to work with them
5 billing takes them a while to figure out what a patient owes because they are always waiting on the insurance company
rest assured dr jim respects your time and will not keep you waiting long at all
my first official yelp review goes out to these ladies
i didnt even go back for my 2nd massageadjustment even thought i had already prepaid for it
she was always difficult to reach anytime prior to that
i enjoyed every single minute of the foot massage
she was focused and did her job well
he also made me promise to call if i wasnt all but better by a certain point to ensure there would be time to try something else and still get me well in time
love this location
i think youll be smiling at smile today i know i am
this is how you conduct business
my disappointed oh was met with a look from the nurse that she kind of understood that i was not pleased but i wasnt exactly in a position to argue  i was starkers and in need of medication refills so whatever
i am only halfway through my treatments and i already see excellent results
great service with a fast turn around
they really worked with me and my budget
everyone is really nice
dr zenner is a good guy and a good doctor
he is very caring and nice the best bed side manners
youll love it
hermann nguyen is the absolute best
i understand that you have long days and a lot on your plate but its no excuse to treat your patients poorly
i understand its a busy place but i left with not a lot more data than when i went in
it actually hurt and not the good kind of massage hurt
they take genuine concern in all your needs and are very sympathetic to your concerns fears and recovery
my husband checked in to be seen and the front office staff were very rude
after about an hour my pain got really worse
my foot pain would wake me up in the middle of the night for years
note that the walkin indicates it is closed but it seems to be rebranded the primary care clinic
that was my mistake
im never going back to these quacks ever again
she did an excellent job and was very informative with a pleasant disposition
i was escorted to my room given a gown and got my vitals taken
whether my doctors have current or outdated data about my diagnosis is not important to steinberg diagnostics whatsoever
we straight up said ok give us the refund and we will go elsewhere
he was assigned to me when i was in the er for a heart attack and thus had  triple bypass surgery
review for labor and delivery and anesthesia they were all amazing
i dont have any opinion on the quality of their glasses since i didnt purchase any just got an eye exam
services like this makes you feel better even when you are sick
yin yoga is very relaxing and really helped me with my super tight muscles and joints
generally no one takes responsibility for issues like this
he was careful and thorough
she looks up and says nothing as we stand there looking helpless
i was taken back into a nice clean room where the nurse asked me several questions and even inquired about potential side effects of a drug allergy i have
dr wilde was a great teacher when explaining my injury and healing process
i took my two nephews today to this place with my brother in law
one of the best things about living in vegas is access to some of the best spas in the country
when i got there i was asked to wait even more time
neshama therapy is not only the name of chen weinbergs massage therapy business but according to her it describes her unique combination of massage techniques and holistic healing philosophy that make up her practice
joanne explained everything she did and why she was doing it
i called abbey dental and left a message explaining that i was told one thing when in fact reality was different and asked for a call back
i have been taking my daughter to meadows pediatrics for 4 years now
staff was awesome and took care of my quickly
i dont know if she really didnt think it was that big of a deal or if she really thought i was going to have that baby that day and was trying not to stress me out
after that horrid experience i made sure i was more proactive in finding an amazing gentle and moral dentist that is when i found dr
but the best partthe genteel doctors work is beautiful and her state of the art builtinoffice crown technology saves so much time and money as well
worth every penny
i tried to maintain my composure as i definitely wanted to cry not only over for why i was there but that i had now wasted 3 hours of my day
do i try to stop thinking
levine childrens hospital has a fantastic reputation on a national level
a similar massage just up the road at talking stick resort will cost you well over 100
matt is the only healthcare practitioner who has been able to take away that pain
get another referral so you can check his prostate
drenda has been amazing with helping me get through insurance issues and everyone there is so nice
probably hoping you dont have receipts to contest it
my daughter actually gets excited about coming here
i was being a total and utter scared baby scared it would hurt scared i would wake up during the procedure scared of recovery and none of my fears were even moderately founded
a genuinely good and honest human who truly cares about his work
different doctor and different two nurses wonderful treatment
plus you can come in any time during business hours and train for as long as you want
customer service sucks long wait time crapy selections and bad for business
again thank you dr haley brown
my son was probably the oldest the couple of times we were there but there were some little kids screaming and crying getting casts on and the staff never let out a sigh and just gently took care of all of them
we will definitely never be visiting this hospital again
yes your clients can see those notes
i had seen dr shim at his first office a couple of years ago and went to see him at his new office at camelview
grand opening of this premier training studio in chandler
hands down best dentist in henderson
wurde von den sprechstundenhilfen sehr arrogant behandelt  daraufhin habe ich mir einen anderen zahnarzt gesucht
it was the first business day after christmas and it was unusually busy
then they just want to talk to you about what you want hello
dr ortale is patient and reassuring so my son lets him clean his teeth
you can really tell that they care
if you havent tried this place yet
when i walked in there i was walking in severe pain from old auto accidents stress and a multitude of sins i just let go until i got to the breaking point meaning i couldnt stand more than about 10 minutes at most and walking had become super painful and slow
she showed me pictures and asked what type of look i preferred
the first appointment was devastating as you can imagine  my dog was confirmed blind in both eyes almost overnight retinas detached
she isnt just looking to sell you products with a quick temporary fix
now i am here  45 min later i get called in to start the process blood pressure ekg etc then of course waiting to see the dr will be atleast 15 min
the technicians take their time with you make you feel comfortable and distract you from the actual procedure by making friendly small talk
he was cute too haha
i go once a week and have never had bad service
so as of today 7262016 i finally get another appointment this morning go in and was told the physician assistant is ill again
the primary dentist in that office actually gave me a crown on the house as the dentist had recently been fired from his practice
and its stuff thats easy to just sort of ignore until you literally cannot ignore it anymore
they are completely dedicated to you and your overall well being
they charge you for a set amount of time and so should be with you for that time
what is the point in having a doctor if they do not wish to help you
upon researching this disease on my own hes right it isnt lupus
dr dave delivered my son on april 25th she was amazing during the whole process
ive been to 2 other optometrists within 3 months
not knowing anyone we used reviews of dr mchale to see if she would be a good fit for our family
we have dental insurance max of 1500 for calender year
andy explained what it was and was very polite about it
if he does have a meltdown its never more then 5 min
me and my son walked in to give blood today and was greeted by the nastiest lady at the front desk alma
i have found everyone at cwh to be professional and the best at what they do
everyone listens to their patients needs
any other studio would have opened one of their mats and added it to their rental collection or would have not even made the mistake in the first place of not providing sufficient rental equipment
this medexpress seemed okay but gave me a medication in a family i had listed among my allergies so i actually got more sick
the range of issues that biomechanics can treat goes far beyond a traditional chiropractor with tendinitis headaches shoulder injuries and carpal tunnel being just the tip of the iceberg
i dont care if this dentist was having a bad day im never going back
in closing if you are fed up with your primary care doctor and hate taking a day off from work just to fulfill an appointment come here
the staff was genuinely pleasant and eager to help a patient who had no immediate family nearbywhile still following privacy laws
shes great with our little girl  were in the best hands
he is very thorough and his staff is great as well
the service staff is great and camille is a phenomenal massage therapist
megan knew my problem areas and not only focuses on those but also offers to work out any other areas and is not timid in applying pressure and her healing touch is life changingthis girl knows her stuff
as a prolific yelp reviewer mostly good reviews some bad reviews i want to take a moment to give a shout out to bodylogic
not so much
first off the place is beautiful comfortable and the staff is warm and welcoming
i am a high level athlete and it has taken its toll on my body
i will transfer my certification to another certifying vendor
she stated do what you need to do as this was the deal
so i had to go to dr spellman 3x this week 3 days in a row because like i said in my last review i had to hustle and fit all my dental work in before i lost my insurance stef thanks again for fitting all my dental work in  i also love how i walked in the door and everyday ashlee and stef knew my name and greeted me with huge smiles before i could even walk to the desk and ashlee remember be from the last time i was i which im embarrassed to say but was may 2013seriously the more i think about it the fact that the staff that sticks around that long  you know dr spellman is in amazing person to work for
higher recommend them if you want great service with friendly staff
and i really liked the personal attention
i dont see how you could find a better place to be
she was professional and asked the right questions
waste of a 60 copay
i never felt like they had my best interest at heart and they certainly never took the time to listen to me
cloverdale dental group has been wonderful to go to
this is important because someone without these qualities who is drilling in your mouth might cause some real problems
they offer same day appointments they just dont tell you it might be a 40 minute drive
i found  pearly whites through yelp and sure enough my fellow yelpers didnt let me down
why all the positive reviews
she asked me to stay and apologized stating she did not know it was my first time
having been in the healthcare industry for over 30 years i get why you wait
the staff was super friendly and helpful
reviewers we will be looking for another provider for these services
the memorable experience begins at the front desk and continues throughout the whole office
i asked can i wait an hour or two for procardia to kick in along with my iv fluids
while waiting for doctor to appear was told to immediately leave by some unnamed office person
i got into the dean health system since one of the jobs i had only offered dean in my area
they also refused to give her a copy of the contract she signed as she entered the program
he gave me the wrong medication and when i called to explain that no one would return my calls
the waiting area is comfortable and peaceful and i felt at ease the moment i walked in
they did not
does not stand behind their products
i walked in because i researched good glasses places near my area and found this gem
outstanding service via phone and in person and excellent massage
ive been a member since november 2015 and have had 2 problems within the 3 months
she doesnt listen to you
it was done in such a patient manor that he didnt even complain
went in for a cortisone shot
if there is anything extra i had expected them to let me know before proceeding
as i said i am an independent student
as a recent resident to las vegas i was in search of a dermatologist to remove a mole
i will be sure to have my pediatrician recommend phoenix childrens hospital in the future and we will never return
needless to say i was a skeptic
although theyre not a traditional massage parlor they get the job done
doug lakin is one of the best doctors ive ever encountered  as his 9 consecutive best of phoenix awards will attest
and held back the next months meds
dr garner and his staff made me feel at ease and right at home upon my first visit and theyve become like family ever since
clearly lm an irresponsible pet owner who just doesnt give a damn
they made me reschedule another appointment and wanted me to repay  another copay
she basically was telling me that i was having these health issues because of my age
he was so nice and worked with me on the price
my technician is never very friendly and makes me feel almost uncomfortable at times
erwhnen mchte ich auch unbedingt das praxisteam
will never come back here
the gals at the front desk printed them out for me no problem
but the front office ladies are quick to tell you its a new office policy every time i call
the place is clean and always smells nice
most amazing dental experience ive ever had
my massage with hector was one of the best
i will be back here for walk ins because they are very close by
i am so happy i found this place and i can get peelsmicros often covered under my insurance
definitely recommend this trip
wait was about 20 minutes so no complaints there
ok well then how about fixing my nail and changing my color
great customer service and very friendly workers
they didnt seem to care very much
my bad choice
i have been seeing dr mcgowan weekly for over 2 years now and he has helped me a lot despite the fact that i am currently living in a very difficult situation that i cant get out of so he essentially keeps me sane and helps me to better my self esteem
charles trained her and she just has that eye for symmetry beauty and perfection
dr rairigh is an artist hobby
id recommend to anyone in the phoenix area
they had no care in how they approached their patients or their mental health needs
bravo to the entire team including the front office for providing an exemplary dental experience
he is very personable and great at what he does
staff is always friendly attentive and knowledgeable
my co worker went also and loved it and my step dad swears by them
i phoned left a message
very nice people selection of glasses is okay  i was expecting more variety
i particularly like the fact that there is a charity component in the office like supporting a clean water project in a remote location
i have no idea because i always leave zuzanas yoga classes with an indescribable feeling of peace and energy
the receptionist is rude and appointments time are useless
had an appointment and 45 minutes later im still in the waiting room
seems like somebody in management thinks its a cute policy to make patients confirm their appointments a week before they occur
something abruptly came up on my schedule so i called in hopes to reschedule my appointment
their staff usually gets me in the same day or at least the same week
the massage itself was nice but the ladies kept leaving the room for long periods of time during the massage which was slightly annoying
get over it and honor their time
my husband and i took in all our medications and our doctors name and address from new york so they could get out records
my boyfriend got my a groupon for my birthday and i setup an appointment with summer
makes it so easy for working parents like me and my husband
im a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and everyone you encounter in your life is meant to bewell the universe really came through in bringing me to see jesse a year ago and i havent seen anyone else since
after receiving questionable results from a routine mammogram the screening office called to inform me that i needed a more in depth look and i made an appointment
i loved all of them
in fairness this was on a sunday of edc weekend when everything in the city is subject to depleted stocks
dr cain is warm easy to talk to and free of judgment
i really liked the environment and the pa i liked everything except dr brassjones
my front tooth was pulled and he sewed me back up
there is a reason these locations are established in the ghettos and barrios of america
i can tell they have been massaging for a while and they are good at what they do
i purchased bruce banner 3 and while a 18th was only 2499  it came in and just over 15 thc now i know that thc is not everything but most all bb 14 i have always had over 25 thc
i actually look forward to my dentist visits here
the entire staff was friendly personal and accommodating
i had an appointment at 230 and came before 200 to a lot time for filling out paperwork
side note ive been treating my forehead with botox for 6 years at 4xsyear this is not my first rodeo my second treatment she did not do as many puncture sites and magically had to use all of the product this time in my foreheadonly 3 months later
she was great
i look forward to every visit which says more about how great this practice is than how weird i am for liking to go to the dentist
they educate you and help you understand what is exactly going on in your mouth
i really do
dr shwartz and his team are fabulous
lakes dermatology is a onestop answer to your skin needs dr victor rueckl is a master of cosmetic injections he and his competent staff are up to date on cutting edge products and treatments the lumecca laser at the spa at lakes dermatology has helped me tackle my rosacea and age related discolorations jenn  my technician of choice does a great job ive sent a variety of patients to dr rueckl and all have been over the moon happy
staffs are rude when questions are being asked
super apotheke da gibts auch fter mal was gratis  traubenzucker tempos etc
thank you again for being a wonderful doctor
lilly was the most honest refreshing woman
after her appointment she came home very happy and couldnt stop talking about how nice this doctor cooper was
the price is also great for those of you that are wondering
we had a fantastic chiropractor in chicago and it was a great loss to us when he retired
i meet with dr duhon later this month and feel very good about the surgery thus far
everyone is genuinely nice and care about what you have to say and what your needs are
i booked a couples massage
obviously people arent coming as often as the other locations
joseph clearly went over every step that he was making along with making sure we understood everything that was being said
just keep dr whalen on your radar good guy
the best beauty lab in las vegas
me and my husband just walk in the place  i first time get foot massage
it is easy to get an appiontment he makes referrals when eneded and has helped me get back on track with a medical issue
the biggest change to the facility is the addition of a quiet room to enjoy while waiting for your massage room
you need to hire someone more mature to handle your front desk area  as they are the 1st people we see when we enter your practice  they can make or break whether we continue to see you or go someplace else where we are respected as a customer
her calmness kind of rubs off on you if you are a whiteknuckler like me in the dental chair
the charge was 190
instead they let me build my way back into society yes it takes 3 months to get to the point where you no longer have to go in on saturdays which is really huge
he was continuing to decline fast and depressed
you will be so disappointed with this dentist
he did give me an epipen prescription that i needed and a referral for further testing but i definitely wont be going back in the future
li li was a very passionate and caring dr
seriously do not go here for airbrushing
i love the staff and the selection of stylish glasses
unfortunately its not the best ever
they then tried to charge me 180 for new lenses and when i said no way they tried to charge me 100 for what they called in houses lenses
if youve never been to this amazing place try it soon
definitely will go back
when i picked out the frame it was on back order but the sample frame had some scratches on it
if you are behind that long you shouldnt be in practice
but im going to look around for a second opinion she said well we need 60 deposit to book the appt
i set an appt with dr chuang and love her
its 2016 we do everything on our phones
everything went well for this first appointment
management is horrible
i love that he is conservative in his treatment plani for a minute i feared i would need double the work i originally planned on
i have made great strides with my lower back pain
i absolutely will look into signing up for membership and continue visiting as i was very pleased with the line of services potentially available as well as the good massage and friendly staff
didnt you read the fine print
dr paulsen does
and he mentioned that the credit card reader had done that all the day before so probably wasnt working
i drive all the way here from summerlin
lily is amazing
sometimes i wonder if they do oversell their services
when relaxing i prefer nature sounds but in this case i would have been knocked out with the right music and a great massage
time to get a clue on customer service
everything was back to normal if not even better than normal thanks to the dr   this is one of many examples but i appreciate the way this team goes above and beyond for not only its patients  but friends of patients
theres also an amazing social aspect to this workout and the gym culture at rpm overall which makes it genuinely fun
i have tried everything to be able to see through these lenses
prices are okay
dr wistort is so nice and knowledgeable he has helped my migraines and back pain disappear
she had walked away from that experience thinking that laser hair removal was not only exorbitantly expensive but also akin to purchasing a new car with all of the haggling and shadiness she experienced
he said to me while looking at the xrays did anyone ever tell you you had a bad hip
they smell amazing and relaxes you
i have peace of mind knowing dr corey and his staff are available to help me postpone the darn aging process
i was impressed with this office when i first started taking my children here but for the last couple of years ive had nothing but bad service from the office staff and the doctors rushing us in and out
please reread the instructions that you were sent
im talking about the mesa location btw
i am glad to brin my business herepatricia the receptionist was awesome and very helpful
i then asked him if i would see the doctor the next time i came in and he said no i would see another pa i let him know i had seen a doctor about this for a year and respectfully that the reason i came to the specialists office was to see a doctor who specializes in urology
i strongly recommend superstition endodontics for any of your dental needs as dr barney and the entire staff are awesome
they took great care of me considering i found out i was pregnant at 24 weeks
i am sure there are some decent therapists here based on the large number of favorable reviews but its hit or miss
i contacted groupon again and request a full refund
i highly recommend dr ross w nash to anyone needing a dentist
they have no urgency or compassion for their patients
so selecting a new personal trainer here in the valley of the sun was no small deal for me
i love the atmosphere and personal professional attention
ive never been to a chinese massage place where they had hot stones as part of your massage so that was a nice treat especially since i never had a hot stone massage before
ive had eye problems since i was a child and with my most recent retina problem a year and a half ago drdavis inspected both eyes to make sure there arent any more problems
she attempted to call out as i heard her manager tell her she didnt have anyone to cover her and they were booked for the day
it was probably in the 50s up there too so its a good thing we were dressed relatively warm
i had vsp insurance which covered my exam and even helped me with the cost of my frames
i wish it were a little closer to my house as i go to the one on flamingo and 215 this one has a much nicer frozen food section
i have been to numerous chiropractors and most never got it right
they are made while you wait eliminating the need for a temporary and another day off from work
the doctors here really know what theyre doing and are all very friendly
we made only the first appointmenti didnt feel pressured to agree to all the recommendations until i had time to study them
highly recommend this urgent care
she has a remarkably level of sensitivity to my emotional and physical needs
its a new business so i hope they can improve their service
they take my insurance so i am able to afford my sessions
dr kessler did another great job of carefully examining my eye while causing as little additional irritation as possible
professional noninvasive gentle to the mind and body and the results are beyond anything you have ever seen
i also need to mention that the gift shop and the cafeteria were also greatnot to mention they have a peets coffee shop inside as well
both the assistant manager and manager have been so helpful in rectifying the situation
during xrays i let my xray champ know ive a small mouth and she succeeded in nearly a zero amount of uncomfortabilitytruly amazing  betsy was cheerful funny and diligently  thorough as my teeth had much plaquesome sore spots
you might want to call them
i feel as if ive been completely ripped off by this place and now i have no money left to see another doctor to have my foot problem resolved
i dont doubt it but they were indifferent with my daughter
even tho they were pretty quiet it is very distracting to me
its not so much the cancelling multiple times which dont get me wrong is bad but the lack of even trying to fit you in
life goes by so much easier without having to worry about contacts and glasses and the little bits of maintenance that come with them
not only did they find the tear in the new graft and the meniscus but she also had a cyclops lesion
its been a few since ive seen her because of insurance changes but i made an appointment for an annual eye checkup and came in the other day
he really took the time to get some wonderful shots and worked with us with any ideas we had for poses and so on
the receptionist even remembered me at my second appointment which made me feel welcomed and appreciated as a client
i had a very nice experience here
i am very disappointed with this
offers customers the ability to either purchase or rent on all their products
no one has had the courtesy to call her back
how much were you paid for your review
if he really thinks this kind of talk is ok then shame on the school that trained him
even though i was listed as emergency contact
hope to never return to them for anything if i have anything to do with it
well i get a phone call from him later on saying that they told him if he wanted another massage that he would have to pay another 50 for one massage
a friend bought me a 3 month membership and a couple of gift cards last year
i was seen for a sports injury by jeff
i was literally just there the day before making the phone call
i have recommended him to all my family and friends
everyones really nice
then someone else said there was a death in the familyexcuse after excuse
that place is very welcoming and the nurses also keep up on your updates to feel connected with you
you blew it billing
she used her teeth ugh to rip the iv plastic off and start it going on me
overall i like this dentist and will keep going as a regular for now also i like goodie bags at the end of my service and thought that was a plus
ive heard great things about this place and i was long overdue for some destressing
this was my first massage and i was a little worried because of my back surgery
they let you know exactly what youre going to be going through and what they see every step of the way
i absolutely love dr broines and her nurse
they always explain everything whether it be a procedure billing or the best products to help with clean healthy teeth
my dad was in the navy for 21 years and we moved all the time
i have never had a problem with teeth cleanings but almost a year later i walked into my new dentists office in a near panic over the memory of my experience with the wrights
people in this place dont really care about customers
like i said before i have never experienced floating before
the weights are usually racked or not far off to find and the equipment never looks dirty because members use their towels usually other than the ropes of course
i would gladly give a higher star rating if i was allowed to keep a shred of dignity
recently added stress reduction and sleep assistance using strobe glasses and binural beats
i agree w laila
this system has good and bad points you can often get in to see someone if need be
quest bars were a few dollars less than 2 other places i check but that depends on who is putting what on sale
manager chris  was reported to corporate
i sat for 45 minutes waiting for the product to be brought up
i go to the dentist twice a year and take good care of my teeth
insurance wouldnt cover due to way leas than a year since  initial visit
had a great experience every appointment i had
also a day or two after submitting the original yelp review the doctor called me and left a voice mail saying that i did not return a previous call she made
new moms and moms with young ones great options for losing the baby weight
this was my first time seeing her so i found it incredibly rude that she would not hear me out and snapped at me several times
our goal is 120125 degrees but i have confidence dr petrick will be able to help me reach our goal
all around ann deserves the business
i was told i had a collection balance and had to come up with almost 300 to make an appointment or get anything from them
the cost came out to what i was expecting so no hidden fees or surprises
dr huang emailed me within minutes and met me within an hour
he operates out of the target at spectrum mall which is close and has convenient office hours
they took the most thorough xrays and inmouth pictures ive ever had and everyone i dealt with there was super nice
definitely a must for anyone curious about how to live a healthier happier life
i had 2 days worth of work and with both days i had zero pain and didnt even need to rinse my mouth out with warm salt water or take no ibuprofen becauselike i said there was no pain
just give it a try you will not just like it but love it
dr lucas and nancy erdman are amazing women who i completely trust with all my health concernsmenopause diabetes anxiety etc i highly recommend this practice and will not go anywhere else
i met nancy and she was god sent
hands down the best vet visit i have ever been a part of
it doesnt get better than this office i can guarantee it
a padoctor came in asked what was wrong looked me over pretty quick checked my strep throat test did not have it thank goodness then left to write me a prescription
i have a very hard time keeping my eye open for the eye pressure test
we stay for dr remmouche she is the only reason we havent left to find another office
great staff too
they didnt have my medical records they hadnt even ordered them yet
i had surgery just yesterday afternoon and woke up this morning and was amazed about how well i could see
i told her i will not pay 48 due to the reasons above and i will have no choice but to see another dentist she said she would make a note of that on my accounti will not be coming back really inconsiderate to customers
how can someone that dedicates her life to caring for children be this rough coldhearted and so disconnected
everytime after the massage i feel totally relaxed
going through a renovation but there still shouldnt be dirt all over the bed
i was so disappointed in my appointment with dr strimling
we get here around 530am and its super quiet and dead
its great that she can go to one place for her diabetes and to treat an infection
we have the hpn hmo group plan
later i went to my regular doctor because they finally had openings and was treated for a sinus and ear infection and finally got better  but aside from the doctor incompetencei got my bill recently
i was charged  over 3000 for twenty minutes in the er
what a great new place
they still need to accommodate for recreational
there was not paperwork
the turn over rate for lmts and front desk associates is insane too a lot of them just leave this place
there are a few different doctors that are just friends and every single one of themis absolutely amazing
the reviews were awesome and people were happy
a nurse called my name and showed me back to the exam room
xrays took about 8 minutes and waiting for results were about 10 minutes
love love love this place
takes them forever to deliver the equipment and also a very long time to pick up
i love this place
the doctors attention to detail and common sense approach to dentistry are something special
heeding my preferences i was given referrals to again female a dental hygenist and endodontist
ive discovered amazing products that i cant get anywhere else in las vegas including chi tea green tea its a great tasting extremely potent green tea extract that can be added to just about anything
the staff was great and helped me get through procedure with ease
that seems to work okay
the staff has been helpful as well
i can only imagine how good they are with kids so friendlyfun for all ages and who says that about dental work
most docs give you 10 minutes before they push you out the door
the place was clean and quiet
best money i spent all week
5 towels towels are included in your membership small gym towels for while you workout large ones for when you shower
we started going to them when they were at their desert inn location
thank you so very much
after meeting dr john and dr allison i decided to sign up for their suggested program
i called to make an appointment and the woman who answered the phone very rudely informed me that they are too specialized to see my daughter for a visual disturbance and she  the receptionist is going to deny my referral because she a receptionist that has never seen my daughter or gone to medical school doesnt think it is medically necessary and told me i should just take her to an optometrist
staff is the friendliest
this happened to me at least a halfdozen times in my 9 months with this gym
his communication has improved tremendously which has improved his behavior as well
obvious they dont care
today my son was in excellent hands at vista dorada dental
i could have missed my flight
upon awakening i remember a lot of pain disorientation and vomiting
so for one really simple nothing extreme procedure i had to be in contact with three different receptionists  others at this cosmetic center
ive had a membership at the other massage place for almost a year now  i have never had a massage even come close to the one i had at elements massage
this diet is really hard but if you want it you can do it and it will work
they take the time to really listen
from the doctors they are hit or miss
price is great an the service is top notch
but as they walked one patient out of what looked like their procedure room they were walking another one in without even cleaning the room
i had amanda give me a massage and i thought she was just great  lovely person and helps with tight muscles like a champ
dustin  jen pearson
i cannot recommend this office to anyone
the dr spoke to us as normal people he didnt talk down to us at all i have experienced this from a couple of drs
overall i enjoyed my time here
friendly staff amazing prices  overall just a perfect experience i will definitely be back
please trust me when i say that i am very white with dark hair so in theory i should be the ideal candidate but after 9 treatments i still see zero results
i have colitis with chronic pain and nausea
today is my 3rd time trying to get the 2nd test placed because they insist that i wait in line for all the patients to be seen before they will place it
take my advice go somewhere better and read the other reviews that dont glorify this place
she is incredibly knowledgeable and experienced which is of course critical
the treatment rooms are quite basic but adequate quick note the walls are not thick so conversations can be heard through walls
i love this office dr and staff
you can ask and get your hand slapped
then the doctor came in said he looks good and we left
when you make your next appointment here you will feel genuinely cared for
they had availability the very next day
this place is the most horrible place i have ever been too
i cant believe i put up with a clunky uncomfortable chair for so many years
they are located right near the cmc off 51 and 485 and have very convenient hoursim talking until 8p on weeknights plus saturday and sunday walk in hours
i finally made the decision to get some spiritual guidance a couple of weeks ago and after reading the great reviews i chose to see terri
finally we picked them up in person and now they started in with me not being on my spousess list of approved people to talk to
the work of the dr stockton herself was up to standard however her office staff was extremely unprofessional and rude
they notify us when theyll be there and they get it done
the gentleman who signed us up gave us a deal that actually made it as cheap as lvac which is arguably the cheapest in town
dr brian miller is very easy to connect with and he never rushes and explains everything to me so i understand what my vision issues are
staff are very friendly and welcoming
my husband went to see dr higgins and he was all about selling you more services than you need
dr lam and her staff are so incredible
the whole company is a joke
then she nip me 3 times with the nippers
i visited this urgent care for a consultation since i had yet to find a primary care doc in the area
i can be a bit of a wuss sometimes when it comes to doctortype stuff
i was nervous with it being a weight loss clinic in all
at this point  i was asked to leave the room because the female filipina doctor has to do the ever memorable rectal exam
they always answer the phones and you are always taken care of promptly when you have appointments
after that i was taken to another room where the office manager discussed pricing and took payment
my first consultation with drsalb was none reassuring
we were treated with utmost respect and kindness
the manager told my friend that maybe next time she shouldnt by a groupon and she might then get what she paid for
marcia is a very caring and easy to talk to professional and has been in the industry over 15 years
the minor downside to his office is that most of the time he runs late
she said i guess the person that signed me in didnt know all the test that were going to be done
he is the most professional and careful doctor ive ever been to
i love robin and i believe its tanika
our hospice nurse stephanie was as sweet loving and compassionate as could be
from the moment i stepped in the front door i was welcomed into this peaceful supportive and positive community
i appreciate that when it was our turn we werent rushed its just not so fun being on the other end
when there the doctor didnt even want to do the procedure as they made me wait nearly 2 hours as they were behind and everyone had left for lunch
please hire responsible receptionists someone could get hurt if they arent aware of the severity of their reactions and are unable to contact their doctor
the ten minute chair massage she provided was wonderful so i booked an initial appointment and have become an ultimate serenity member with absolutely no regrets
so simonmed told me on wednesday and i still have nothing at all on my account even temporary
the office is small and cozy
how are you going to send someone to get chemo medicine if you have absolutely no idea where the cancer is
these were the primary staff members with a clue
xoxo ann marie smidt
tom and grace are the best
this is the first time ive had an issue
i started visiting dana earlier this year
dr baker and his assistant jen were so kind
so glad i chose skin factory laser for my tattoo removal
i highly recommend this to anyone who is stuck and serious about losing weight
waiting for dr sugarman in the exam room the assistant and i made small talk about how school was going and their new facility
i have been a patient since 2013 and go to this location but have also gone to their newly opened office
i couldnt be happier with the ease of care and treatment i received at desert west chiropractic
the front desk ladies are incredibly friendly and always welcoming and i adore my doctor
we received a warm friendly welcome when we walked in
the woman who was getting married
they explain things to me in a manner that i can understand given my present problem with my vision
precision dental was able to get all of my work a lot of work done before my secondary insurance expired
we have been patients of dr p for a while
make sure you know what their dilution practices are
ive had 2 appointments so far both ran very late from my appointment time  even had to step out after an hour in the exam room with no one coming in
does a fantastic assessment and wont lead you on to pad his pocket book
great followup too
i was coming in for a 2pm appt and today was hopefully not typical as i waited a long time to be seen
the whole team including laura at the front desk is uber friendly and uber professional
almost any place you go will have similar products but its the people you go back for and they have it down
i would highly recommend
she is usually tending to an emergency eye surgery which requires everyone to wait a long time
they saved my life here once and have taken great care of my mother who had two surgeries here
ive been going to dr falcon for a few years now and i have to say shes just great
most of their equipment doesnt work outdated and not enough equipment to go around
she was very sweet and friendly
one signed in it was another 10 minutes or so to get called back by ana
after our main doctor left becky we tried to stick it out but no longershe was the only shining light in the office
would definitely recommend this location
shes also great about giving you samples and coupon cards to minimize your costs
i would highly suggest trying them out if you havent already
if neither are available i also like dr lareau and dr noh
i just had my first assessment but not the therapy yet
im glad i found a good dentist during my brief time in madison
i am not prone to writing bad reviews especially in such a vehement tone but health aint no joke doc
i absolutely loved the service i received from kellie rivarde at eyeglass world
yet hundreds of surgeries later he still believes that what a great doctor should do spend time not just with patients but time with patients family members
mom found 3 frames that she loved but one was a green tag frame we later found out it would only cost 10 more for that pair
what exactly are we evaluating
he said that i needed to come back in to see him and pay another 30 copay
the infection was so obvious i couldnt believe it when he said he remained unconvinced one existed at all
we came to what i thought was an agreement but i ended up having to work it out with the collection agency myself
it starts out with footwork and really gets those triceps not to mention the abdominals
around 6pm dr athari situated me at my own paced since i was a nervous wreck
i we already saw a doctor
she is very friendly and really dedicated to solving your skincare needs
they are just a machine to get as much money out of you as possible
this place is overrated
dr hayley brown is the best
look no further for the absolute best massage on earth
hey company execs you may want to revisit your policy that requires people in the lobby to watch stupid movies while waiting to be seen
i was so sick and so i called to ensure they could see me seeing as to how they were closing soon
i do enjoy that ive had the same hygienist consistently and that she remembers i have a daughter and always ooos and ahhhs over the pictures
ive never had a dentist call me after the fact to make sure i was satisfied with the results and if not to make it right no matter what
i know someone said they put all their time into new patients but i have left 4 messages over 3 weeks and i have never even gotten a call
they were terrific
she is an amazing person and medical professional
dr  trinh is very nice n caring dentist he made sure that his patients are well taken of n he even call personally to follow up n check his patients if everything is alright
the receptionist gave me a full printout of my planofaction with all costs lined up and how much my insurance would cover
i went to my appointment and waited for an  hour and a half just to be seen
lack of empathy
are you kidding me
probably since i am new to vegas and am not used to such extreme temperatures
he ended up getting aspirated pneumonia after that
ive taken a hiit crossfit type class here but what sets it apart is the knowledge of the trainers
she called out poses that i had no idea how to do didnt make any adjustments and didnt play relaxing music or have much of a relaxing voice
she is amazing and so helpful
easy to talk too
they do monthly drawings for stuff like sonic toothbrushes which is cool
the staff is like visiting old friends
ive been coming here for awhile and its always good but mark was awesome
for foot massage you experience a foot bath with a shoulder massage to begin with
through my travels ive gone to numerous spasestheticians none of them exhibit the same level of skill and personalized care as summer
their experience in the business definitely showed
actually recommend other places i enjoyed massage envy better
i didnt even feel the numbing shot
my husband and i renewed our 15 year wedding vows through the elvis package
he loves the kids and bends over backwards to help with anything
now its my turn and you talk to me like im some kind of annoying pest
the room i slept in  was pleasant very clean and comfortable
i highly recommend paying this establishment a visit
the waiting room smells like cigarettes and walls  floor are very dirty
the staff admits to not having the proper training by the corporate office as to how to read medical insurance out of pocket expenses
it wasnt until she started actually waxing that she noticed just how fine the hair had gotten
all he does is just prescribes shit and doesnt even care about the actual problem just wants you to leave impatient
i am so happy that i found a great dentist on my first try and ill be seeing them again in 6 months
the receptionist reiterated it was my fault when i got back
excellent customer service
wish i could get my teeth cleaned here
if i want an extra treatment during the month its another 150 charged per treatment
from the first time we stepped into the place until the time we drove away it was nothing but organized and friendly
they are honest and recommend only whats best for you
dr sohn and his team have exceeded my expectations
when my cousin a doctor is on call i believe he uses a pager as well so i think its farly common in the healthcare industry
your office manager also told me it is not your offices policy to give out the file
i go here quite a bit and love it
upon looking at photos of this clinic i realized i was reviewing the wrong doctor and place
also nathaniel has 23 years experience in this field so his scope of practice is very vast
dr lee is very knowledgeable
husband and i had 1700 to burn on our flexible spending account
you can really tell he has a passion for what he does
in all of my 52 years of life i can say that rukiya chavers is the best doctor ive had
my money was well spent
i say pediatricians because if you want to go in the same day you might not get your pediatrician that day because heshe may be out or at another location but personally i havent had a problem with any of the pediatricians
very expensive and no guarantee of the work done
she also screwed me over by not checking my ipledge and just telling me to do it when apparently the office has to set it up again
she must be the only eye doctor that knows what the hek she is doing
the answer i got says it all i think it is mrs kuhl wife of dr kuhl but there is another woman who says she is the office manager but she does not have the title so to be honest no one knows who the office manager is  the lack of professionalism by the doctors the incompetence of the front office staff and the outright disinterest in patients borders on negligence
the staff is amazing and dr smith is the most capable dentist in the valley
oh and the facility is so nice it feels like youre walking into some kind of movie set
he always remembers what you have said even if its six weeks after he last saw you
he is so unprofessional
they also give out guest passes so you can sit in on any class before signing up which is so helpful
since then i have had regular botox injections dysport chemical peels and laser hair removal at evolve and have been more than happy with the results
a part from the time it takes the dentists arent very social or friendly with the clients
prayers for you scott
by far the most upscale laser hair removal facility in vegas
the irony they kept insisting visitors wear masks and gowns
i love their facility which is always clean and never over crowded
l john dory twitter ljohndory
many many thanks
they have created a relaxing environment with private individual rooms
i did have to wear reading glasses however
when you cancel membership they will tell you to go through a loophole of corporate phone calls and paperwork
i have little to no growth in the treated areas
dr rouhani has been our family dentist for years and weve been very pleased with his office
she was more concerned about her repeat customer who was next than making me into a new customer
altogether exactly what we needed at the time
i proceeded to run after him waving my arms thinking he would see me and stop nope
it was a huge inconvenience because i literally took the day off drove there talk to the assistant for at least 10 minutes to let her know why i was there for a refill then the doctor came in and i felt like she spent 5 minutes with me to say hi look at my face real quick and to just be given a new prescription for the same medication that ive had before
what gym doesnt have at least one bench press rack
totally worth it for the message
my mom called to complain and they didnt do anything
the massage chair was activated and i spent the next 15 minutes in pamperville
i never left with any doubts or questions
i popped a lozenge and felt immediately relieved the sudafed also cleared my nose
i am pain free and the tooth isnt even sensitive
best orthodontist ever
the wait time to see this doctor is over 25 hours
i am so glad i stopped by and saw cory herbert because of her and her knowledge i am able to make my son feel better
what a joke and a waste of time
my girlfriend is a regular here and now i know why
the ultrasound tech was a complete dick
what stands out to me the most about dr ricciardi is how you feel he genuinely cares and listens
they had raffles with free treatments and different prizes
you should be ashamed of yourself
we cannot say enough great things about ashley
the selection of frames was a bit limited about 200 but sufficient and carried many of the top brands
the receptionists sit in the waiting room with ipads to check you in
the office staffruby and stacy were very welcoming  when i entered and left and efficiently set up my next appointment and took payment
i asked if my urine came back bad and she said it must have
and should i feel ashamed that ive memorized all of tony hortons dialogue
the customer service has a record of my husbands wheelchair and can easily see that the generic one wont work on his chair
dr crisler came into the room with him
a few minutes later the billing girl came in and said they could do one filling and that i would need to come back to have the other and my cleaning done
ultimately im leaving a 4 star rating because although i had issues im really happy with my glasses their quality the price the warranty and most of all my most recent customer service experience involving the store manager
people that mess with heads of people who have messed up heads
it has a cinema room where you can watch a movie
no well call in a weeks supply until you get in or anything
great place to shop for slipresistant work shoes sketchers brand clogs etc
right there is where your mind gets put at ease
go see her  thank you terri for our session i appreciate you beyond words   brittany t
at the moment of writing this review 61516 the billing issues is still not resolved
but the facilities like many people below have mentioned are really outdated
and hour and a half later he comes back in and is explaining whats going on with my kid and leaves again to ask for more advice
he told me i had no cavities and allowed for any additional questions that my dental hygienist would then examine the health of my gums and provide the appropriate type of cleaning
also kind of a specific point dr aaron circumcised my second son and it was a much better experience than my first son got at a different practice
they ordered them for me and i picked them up less than a week later
despite repeated requests to be transferred to the va hospital in phoenix i was routinely ignored
ive now been going at least 23x per week and see the difference it makes every day
i do like the locals request for fund raising for the less fortunate
theyre all about the patient and their needs not filling up the appointment book and their wallets
i will continue to give her my business
terry is great
dr nguyen even helped me look through frames
i have had plenty of massages in my life but this was by far the best
she didnt express any concern in this comment
i was recently referred to aair by my pulmonary doc to have an allergy test
i had an appointment here last week
once the surgery was over the doctor informed me of a hernia that i had in my belly button that he fixed complementary
i ended up sending my hubby to see what was going on and he came back with the nurse that told me the doctor was in air and nobody could get a hold of her
no one here even tries
i suspect this was a case of a discrepancy between the amount the insurance company was believed to cover versus what they actually covered
we asked a lady that we met if she could recommend a good dentist
i had an upcoming vacation following my appointment and they got a rush on my prescription sunglasses  i had them in two days
he was in the room less than one minute for my 50 copay
katrina definitely knows her stuff
she hit some pressure points very firmly on the soles of my feet but i loved it it reminds me of how you feel after a days workout where it hurts but it feels so good at the same time
wont be coming back for any of my medical needs for sure
second i never felt like i was just another patient that was moving through the chair
really enjoyed this urgent care
the appointments are scheduled in an organized fashion i have never waited for a long period of time
i cannot recommend strongly enough against going to this practice particularly to see emily tarazi
while numb and under bad lighting i was asked to choose my new crown color from swatches held up to my rear molars
they finally found my appointment which they said had been cancelled
very friendly  knowledgeable plus saved us the expense of  dental work
you can go their as a walkin or with an appointment
i took time off of work and went to this appointment to be told that not enough product had been used on me in the first place
the world be a better place if this company closed its doors
wish there was another option
do your research and think carefully before proceeding down either path
it is always a pleasure to be in this place to unwind and relax all the stress you have
it felt more like going for physical therapy
note i do not appreciate you flicking your sweat on me
you let them know the pressure youd like the massage to be ahead of time and they keep track of who youve had in the past so you can pin point who you like best
this is the word that comes to mind when i think of giving tree phoenix
i will definitely go again next year but i will plan to stay a little longer
a beyond motivating atmosphere with great trainers that make you feel at home and like you are apart of their family
i also explained to her that this is the price that was agreed upon so its wrong for them to change it last minute
lee is an excellent trainer who not only pushes boot camp attendees to achieve great results but is an amazing source of general health knowledge relating to everything from eating right to rehabbing old injuries
it even has the friendliest cat on the planet im not a cat person
id  recommend this to anyone who really wants to get away from the rat race and enjoy some inner peace
assumed it was going to be an extra fee but should have asked
words cant express the happiness i feel after receiving treatment from alice
time to find another doctor
i liked this as it allowed me to be totally ready before the day came so i wouldnt need to go to the pharmacy afterward
the staff here are always smiling and are great with everyone
no surgery was needed just rest and immobilization
youre welcome for complimenting your doctors however the lack of care for your patients is enough to remind all potential customers to avoid your business
granted ive learned a little due to there error
i cannot get a return phone call from the finance person named sammy
i havent seen a dentist for awhile i was very scared that i would need surgery to remove my wisdom teeth
dr la is very considerate of my financial constraints and skepticism
after receiving a filling that brought me constant pain for almost a year and after having three terrible dentist visits at two different offices all smiles dental care  downtown phoenix dental i followed the recommendation of a friend and made the 25 minute drive to seventh street dental
by far the worst experience ive ever had at a hospital
they were friendly to my wife and i in the waiting room and my daughter had a blast on the toys
so she had her assistant bond my tooth temporarily in the meantime which didnt even last a day
dr josh is an excellent chiropractor
maybe waited 10 minutes saw the pa got my prescription and went on my way
i have had some great experiences and bad ones that almost made me give up extensions all together
hes friendly funny took my concerns seriously and gave great advice when i asked
hes an excellent artist and very personable  ill definitely be coming back again
i am so grateful to this place for all their hard work
i will definitely return and recommend to others
the staff is professional and personable
i dont know where to start  there are too many things i like about de vries   my skin improved after couple visits
our massage therapists really listened to our needs and tailored our massages to our needs
our baby is a beautiful baby boy
i had the most positive experience here at mccormick dentalthe office made me feel comfortablefrom the time i was greeted to when i left everyone i met was so kind it truly made me feel more comfortable
i was able to book a same day appointment which was great after a stressful weekend with family
went back in talked to my doctor he of course defended the other doctor saying she was going off different tests
this was after repeated attempts to try to sell me invislign at quite an overpriced rate that i declined
gabino is marias nurse
finally i told him that we werent comfortable since there were guys in the room
it was a great experience and at only 30 for the 60 minutes its so inexpensive
so while your feet is soaking in warm water they give you a scalp and face massage which i really enjoyed
gayle the office manager is incredibly knowledgable about insurance and used dr lims assessment to plan my appointmentsprocedures based on what my plan would cover and what i could afford
he said why are you here if it helped
dr john is a softspoken professional who is clearly interested in doing a thorough job while making his patients most comfortable
i came here yesterday with my sister in law without an appointment and they were able to accommodate us at around 5 pm which was cool
surgery was great and so was the follow up care
by far the best nurse i have ever had the pleasure of dealing with
every time i show up here its like the employees have recently upped their dose of slacker dudebro pills
i was honestly shocked and by the lenses but by the fact that she had even thought of me in the first place
my man like ben he is good but not the girls there
i left with a new toothbrush sensodyne toothpaste to help with my sensitivity  a smile whiter than before the cleaning
everything anyone has said about dr goates and his staff is true
its a nice relaxing atmosphere despite its location on the danforth
last week i suffered what every business traveler fears most  a medical emergency while on the road
there are 2 personal trainers  julie  jay and they are amazing
turns out there were other options creams lasers etc
my daughter and i decided to try this place out
she started arguing with me
very satisfied with the way they treated my son
my prescription is not very high but i have a double astigmatism and they are different directions
i highly recommend them
called and spoke to the store manager who explained that the district manager was off that day and assured us that we would receive a call the following day once he was back in the office
i still grow a little bit of hair which is much much thinner and lighter and i barely ever need to shave
shes currently at their higley office
its absolutely stunning
both me and my insurance company have tried to contact them but either the right person isnt available or no one answers and we leave messages
i gave at least 1 star because someone was courteous enough to call me this morning to confirm address and ensure that the delivery is going out today
called to get my son a shot for school
he used the least invasive incision and results are great
i even saw keurig kcups and products for pups
the reason i gave this 3 stars is because dr grace was so surprisingly fantastic
the best dentist he has had since we moved here dr kim blanding is the best
so with that in mind it was already a great start
thank you paradise ridge dentistry and janelle
dr patel is the most thoughtful caring knowledgable empathetic doctor you will ever find
overall i would definitely come back again if i was not moving to dallas this week
i have gone in for three contact fittings now and it is not a problem they want to find the best contact for me and i appreciate that
over the top rude and just unprofessional
the receptionist shrugged and said i dont have your id and looked away from me
3 months later and they are still sending him for test after test and refusing to do anything until they decide whats wrong
they are not nice people
everyone that worked there was extremely professional
i will definitely use discount cab again
what is this dr  his staff charging me for
she clearly loves all animals even the angry and scared wild cats i sometimes have
then what does the aaa card give me
ive been trying to call their office for a week to make an appointment
ive referred many of my friends who are very pleased with the services and have also become longterm clients
we had a chance to talk about world politics
so i got another opinion from a separate specialist and he agreed that it should always be done after braces
very unprofessional and rude staff
came in for my first ever float with my boyfriend
but aside from an initial delay in getting me checked in and my paperwork processed everything moved quickly and smoothly and much to my delight and surprise i was in and out in an hour
he is honest compassionate willing to go the extra mile for you and really listens
staff is great and knowledgeable place is wellkept and the prices are unbelievably low
around 530 thirty minutes after my appointment i ask the front desk when i am going to be taken back
so if youre a woman youd have to have a stranger look you over at quick care instead of your family doctor whos supposed to be taking care of you
i got my husband and my son to go there
the doctor is so nice and friendly
i am 28 years old and about 2 years i started to suffer with debilitating back pain
i had been power walking 23 miles a day which came to an abrupt halt as suddenly i had difficulty even walking the dog
i am terrified so yes i will repel my boyfriend at night with a big plastic mouth guard
my massage therapist name was josh
she works with your eye shape to create beautiful looks and has great attention to detail
from the moment you walk in they sincerely make you feel comfortable and like a member of their family
a female exercise specialist then took over for the therapist
they even have a sale on frames and i saved a few bucks
i hope your need to respond with lies was worth this
everyone from the front desk to dental hygienists is lovely
they have the nice massage chairs and they put a disposable plastic liner into the tub so that you know your tub is super clean
this is important when youve been to a busy dispensary and cant get anyones attention
they were impatient and billed me twice for services rendered once
you can not schedule appts online
my pain level is much lower and ive noticed an improvement in my posture which is a plus
i also had consultations with three specialists
okwere on vacation and we took an unwanted but very necessary trip to the chiropractor
if my husband was an existing patient that was always missing appt then i would completely understand the fee
they do not call your insurance when they are in network which is illegal
this place has never let me down and i have been continually learning and growing so i can get my health back
it would be hard to pick out the best part of the experience but what was so different than other treatments i have had was the table  it manipulated into so many comfortable positions
the dental assistant sarah and the dental hygienists that helped were also very friendly
overall great experience
coming from los angeles i wasnt sure what to expect
i use the chiropractor services
this is definitely my new goto place for all my nutritional needs
his medicine is not strong enough to counteract the excessively rude condescension he shows towards his patients or their families nor could it ever be strong enough for him to completely throw medical standards out the window and tell you the patient something other than the truth
i value my time past 4 months he continued to experiment with prescribing me blood pressure  meds with none seeming to work and never giving explanation why or when giving new the possible side effects dr wished me to do a sleep study i choose and stated i didnt wish to do so so dr kaveh acted in my opinion very childish by my denial for the sleep study he refused to prescribe me my other meds that he has prescribed over the last 2 yrs if i knew he was so sensitive maybe i should of said i will think about it thin skinned baby who didnt get to collect more money from me cause i didnt wish to do an unnecessary study no loyalty love his staff linda and diane blessed to know you and thank you dr kaveh grow a set
the place was busy but clean and fairly efficiently run
nobody shops me
gave me directions to the centennial location and we were on our way
when to this place to get a yearly eye exam for contact lenses
i have scoliosis and sciatica which sometimes causes a lot of pain  thru the pro adjust system he has really made a difference
instructor was very knowledgable
they are only their to take clients money an perform xrays an mri to get the cost up
i still had my doubts so i called a few other places
had xray done he didnt go over it said needed mri thats it
my previous dentist had given me a multiple page printout of all the dental work that i needed to have done and i never did and dr sadre was able to get my work done in 2 visits onlay and then 2 fillings so i trust her judgment
the nurses are truly lovely and really take their time with me and are so sweet
everyone at the gym is super friendly and helpful
the first was a minor accident man not paying attention and caused only 1800 in damage
dr jacobsen has been our dentist for over 10 years
fantastic doctor and wonderful caring staff
i tried then on and chip would let me know if i looked good in them
docs said its covered and then sent a huge bill later
dr greenberg was amazing and i learned a lot from him about my vision and ways to help my eyes even while working on a computer all day
the first day i became so dizzy from the first injection that it made me a little weary
the information she gathered from me through the reiki session was very accurate and relevant to the issues that i have been having within myself and my life
so they dont always appear approachable but they are all nice
but back to my nailsi was going for a natural look which was achieved to perfection on acrylic nails with gel color
dr kyle was excellent and even gave me some specialists i could go todefinitely the fastest urgent care ive been to and recommend
even though nonstudents can also obtain a membership here as well i believe the nonstudent membership is 25
having never experienced before i feel for those who have and hope i never have to again and so thankful i made it
dr andy is great
they gave me 2 referrals
as long as mtnside keeps it like they have for the last decade ill keep paying my small monthly dues and visiting 4 or 5 days a week
the doctor recommended phentermine and he broke down its use for me
they were professional
the office is clean never over crowded and they have all their processes down pat
im just surprised as the callousness and borderline rude remarks
i felt very comfortable and at ease about the process
there are many great injectors out there but i have to say that susie is hands down the best
i then was left in a waiting room to see dr sundarraj but was shocked because my eyes were not dilated
after 3 weeks i cannot say enough great comments about the care that my mother received the caregivers were exceptional they kept an upbeat attitude with my mom
i have to admit i was a little skeptical about this place but the team at hangover heaven are amazing
when i had any questions or discomfort that happened the staff was always there to help
not to mention the entire time i was in this office they kept trying to sell me on porcelain implants and mentioned having a whitening done when i said i would think about it they had a lady come into my room to try to collect an advance payment for my whitening that i hadnt even agreed to yet they seemed very desperate to get any amount of money they could
thank you for such excellent service and care
when i went in i overheard the childcare manager argueing with another mother about the same thing that i had an issue with
its right across from spanish trails
it has now been a month since he switched my prescriptions and my skin is looking great
when i noticed the unusual activity i called apria to straighten it out
this store is across the street from me so much more convenient than other drug stores but when they ran out of my makeup and didnt restock it in 3 weeks i finally caved  went to walgreens down the road
i have never been so disrespected in my life
when i asked if it would be possible to be seen by him to show him the swelling the nurse excused herself and went to ask him i waited after a few minutes she returned to tell me he said if i had called he would have seen me but since i hadnt id have to wait till the next day
she has also seen my 4 year old and already warned us that he will need braces when he is older
it was standing room only
i contacted them in regards to my complimentary consultation
they explained everything upfront with pricing and there was no pressure to purchase anything
first there was difficulty getting a prescription renewed due to a change in insurance
my son is a picky eater and a good friend told me about the egg whites flavored just drink themi was a little worried but he is now on his 3rd bottle of birthday cake egg whites and the staff was helpful and friendly
i have no idea where he got this extreme prejudice but in hindsight i realise i should have reported his comments and behaviour to the appropriate authorities
i couldnt believe it as i dont have any addiction history with drugs or alcohol
at per spectacles and i thought he did a fabulous job
we rolled a joint and rented a bong
however they do not have any family programs they dont even have visiting
as a result theyve got me medicated well and are always there to help give tips and consider new methods of controlling my allergies
i am so happy with dr abbot and his staff they are so helpful and friendly
this place reminds me of the massage i got in kunming china
when they need attention caregivers are there for them
if i remember correctly the last time i was seen by dr domingo he told me there would be a follow up appointmentbut maybe i was wrong
i wouldnt trade him for the world and because of him and his encouragement ive now taken my oral health seriously again
the staff is super friendly they are very thorough with making sure you know what your dental insurance will cover and where you stand financially
my doctor was in another surgery but a nurse should have come out to talk to him
most importantly my teeth look great and almost everyone is surprised when i tell them that they are false many of them anyhow
its is against the law for them employer to with hold your check or lay you off and not pay you within in time
nurses and doctors communicate very well and do make this a top 4 hospital in the nation
i highly recommend dr foster and i love my new smile
when i received it i took the motor part out of the box and turned it on  it was terribly noisy even though it said online that it was quiet
they dont have the egos of mds they dont treat you as if you mean nothing to them
the only thing we havent paid is the 3390 that was not part of our contract
upon checking out the lady at the front desk said my total was 8925 and my insurance didnt cover it
once we completed treatment i was pain free
she was on a personal phone call for at least 4 minutes and did not acknowledge me to make a second appointment until she was halfway done through the phone call then i guess it was acceptable for her to deal with me
so they take blood and guess what
id like to find a doctor that works and cares for the patient more than then healthcare system
the same girl waited on us and was very nice
i have been working with him off and on for the past 3 years
i gave tfm gift certificates as christmas presents this year and everyone raved that they were the best massages they had ever had
i visited bambu organics on monday 328 after reading the reviews here on yelp
basically every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years enter dr marcia blazer
it felt wonderful but then he felt one side of my neck and said we could do better
i highly recommend them
if they couldnt do the digital images for me on that day why wouldnt they tell me that when i asked before getting the xrays
so we came here and didnt have have to wait to be seated
the staff that ive encountered have been friendly and efficient
i have a mouth full of fillings and a 30 year old crown so i am no amateur  when it comes to identifying whether or not i am getting good dental care
awhile back i had to have a root canal done and the dr  that came in to do it was great
i came here living over an hour away and well worth it
truly americas best
this is my mother
chelsea and michele are informative and not pushy with any of their products they offer
very nice and makes you feel extremely comfortable
i moved her to a new clinic after the horrible care she received from starvita and they tested her wo my pushing unlike lvpi and she did have a uti
dr kim is very nice and has helped my sister get the straight teeth and confidence she deserves
i like to be accommodated and not to be treated like im stupid
they finally brought me to a room where my mom could finally sit and they didnt have me change and got blood all over my shirt
thats in addition to the two weeks or so that ive waited already for them to pick up the phone and get the authorization they didnt need anyway from my insurance company
expect to feel high when you get off the table good gosh she is hands down the best
they all seemed to have their own agenda even though we were very clear in what my wife was wanting for a result
the nurses were a bit militant about visiting hours and not always the friendliest but they took good care of her and there were no horror stories from me or her like the ones at some of the hospitals in buffalo which ive written about before
we paid for a 70 minute massage and it was less than an hour
i choose dr medchill after i left another obgyns office because long story short i just wasnt feeling them
as much as i love getting pampered here driving 40mins from queen creek to tempe for a session is kinda holding me back a little
her approach is refreshing and effective
while telling my sister of my sons awful and traumatic experience she told me about madison pediatric dental
then moved on to shoving her fingers in my ears as if trying to touch my brain
first appointment of the morning yet still another 30 min wait
they dont have any actual phlebotomists there either this nurse will come in and try to take your blood but do it wrong twist the needle around with it still being in your arm to get at least a little bit of blood and then move on to your other arm if nothing comes out
the service was so smooth
ive been coming here for years to get my birth control   the ladies at the desk are always friendly the bad thing about this place is you can never tell how long you will wait   you could be waiting a few min or a few hours so make sure you keep your schedule a little open because you can never be for sure
they make you feel right at home and comfortable
overall i liked my first time experience here
the worst customer service people ever
i like the office in general but they need some serious patient policies
we discussed my medical history and i really wanted to know the reason for my miscarriage
she is the best trainer  every session is a new workout that makes you feel accomplished when its over and gives you results
ive had a few sessions and hes definitely my go to guy for all my massages
they told me she wasnt in and i needed to call monday to speak with her
its not safe
i recommend him without reservation
they also loved the baby and she came with me to my appointments
when i went to the desk to discuss this i found out my appointment had been changed from dr campbell to the nurse practitioner without my knowledge
lovejeet assisted me  my husband in every way possible
we arrived on time got all paperwork filled out and waited to see the doctor
love our pediatric dr hyun she is the best and we have been seeing her for six years
you really feel like an active part of your own healthcare
do not go to this place
donna the dental hygienist was very kind personable and made sure i was not in pain throughout the deep cleaning procedure
absolute horrible first off i had called to ask what was needed to come in and asked if i was able to pull up a bill statement from my phone
but there was a rn nurse who worked on the floor who was ehhhhh no thanks
i love the classes
i threw my back now
one of the things i like best is the extended hours
ive only had good experiences at chandler dental
if you are a road ride enthusiast this is the studio for you if you prefer the inside traditional cycling spinning type class this is not for you
ive been a member at massage envy for probably 5 years now
im using a midwife and birthing center for my pregnancy and they only refer out for 12 scans
overall i highly recommend dr shirleys dentistry especially if you are in the scarborough area
the only reason it got 2 stars is because the assistant was very pleasant
dr daniels is great
he does all of his injections and fillers himself
i had my first visit with  sarah she was absolutely amazing
after that i had my massage with melanie and it was the best massage ive ever had
she can give one mighty deep tissue massage with her firmness
she was way nice and explained everything in detail
i find they by low quality flower and charge top dollar
and the fact that i purchased my treatments at a nearly 85 discount makes it worth the trips
when i went into labor 3 weeks early dr bartell had been on call all weekend i was admitted at 3 am monday morning
im surprised this place has so many negative reviews
the acrylics were  with a younger male 30s ish and i will never ever go back
how unprofessional to have the receptionist for a business ask the customers go and knock on the providers door
nurses and assorted technicians continually flow through the patient rooms checking cuffing poking the patients and seeing to their comfort
no one asked how i was or said hello
please even if you somewhat care for your relative or friend please explore your other options
theyve got some health wellness and exercise classes that i can attend free as part of my membership
hell even yell it out loud  i love my jooobb
to receive them and pay your copay
i have been able to get in same day most times
this was at 1100 appointment was scheduled for 330 expected consult to be with pa thought at least he would meet with me nope consult was done by front office staff
the staff was courteous the cleaning seemed thorough and dr leavitt was very pleasant and charismatic
would go again if needed
her thyroid in the meantime continues to grow and having it removed is being delayed because of the incompetence front office staff
after the pregnancy they switched my birth control several times i had to come back in each month after trying it out and once i found one that worked when i went in to get the refill a different doctor switched it
will never use again
the investment in  coolsculpting catapulted me into taking better care of myself by joining a gym and making better food choices
im an esthetician and i am very picky about the product i put on my skin parabens is the 1 thing i make sure my skincare does not have
i love this doctor
i had a lift with breast implants
also at the time of scheduling the appointment it would have been nice to know i was not seeing the doctor i was referred to though i understand with insurance billing and all things can change
we walked in and like all the other orthodontists we have tried there was an area with video games for the kids
for my own sake i hope i am wrong and it does take overnight for the steroid to work
i also really liked the office staff
she was super sweet and immediately started to show me glasses in the style and brand that i wanted her feed back so so nice and welcoming
i would recommend this place to anyone who wants a tattoo removed
if youre on the fence about your dentist run to dr cooper
immersed in the breast cancer community we hear and see the best and the worst results in breast reconstruction
my experience was pleasant for an optometry visit
i have been going to this facility for several months
so her pediatrician pulled some strings and got an appointment for us to see a spine specialist at pch who was highly regarded
i used a groupon deal and everything worked out great
for those of you who havent tried reiki i highly recommend it
all medication is labtested and the staff are knowledgeable about most if not all of the products available
didnt offer so i asked for a collor
september 21 2016 i have been going to gentle dental for approx
i am so happy with this place also i was able to check in from home so my wait time when i went was minimalmaybe 20min
she only massaged half of my back i did have a facial there once and it was simply mediocre
after the extraction i was checked on personally by the dr and had no problems calling with any questions or concerns
while playing racquetball at the nearby la fitness a friend of mine twisted his ankle and needed to be seen by medical personal we took him to cvmc not far from the gym on washington pike
i will continue to see dr anderson and i think hes a wonderful dr thanks for all you do dr anderson and keep up the great work
no one is here
thanks so much totally worth it
the teacher has a great teaching style as well
i had a problem if my insurance would cover my issues and al at the front desk said hed call and check it out which he did and found out the answer for me
love love love dr kasian
ive got arthritis in my hips and lower back and hes helped me gain flexibility in those areas
for as long as i need chiropractic adjustments i wouldnt even think to go to another office
the dr was personable and the receptionist made the process of selecting my glasses a breeze
dr raines did a beautiful job on my cyst removal and i felt well cared for and extremely comfortable before and after surgery
i felt comfortable during my laser hair removal session and the staff prepped me before with all the important information
at checkout i was speaking to the cashier carlo about a price check  which he already had an attitude with me
they are very modern and go out of their way to make patients feel welcome and comfortable
i was not expecting however the level of customer service that i received
the insurance company again verified the coverage and then decided to three way call edgewater
been with them since 2012 and it has changed my life
im totally fine with that i know thing happen to cause delays
best ob in the las vegas valley
everyone that i encountered was positive and flexible when i needed assistance
she said i was a great candidate
the chairs were comfortable and the masseuse were on point with the pressure and you cant beat the prices
left rejuvenated and ready to have a great day
if you suffer from headaches its worth it to see a specialist
she now has those gorgeous bedroom eyes again
you went on to state im 38 and too young for menopause really  i hadnt considered that
this place has the best strains in phx
the staff truly doesnt care to help solve a problem
11172015 i was asked to modify or delete my yelp review by the dentist so here is my modification
service isnt good and they over charge
caring conscientious eye care
he was committed to helping me work towards my health  weight loss goals and i tried 2 different programs
i highly recommend working with her
i got a 1 hour thai massage consists of lots of different stretches of all muscle groupsthen a 30 minute foot massage
they were discontinued and the very last pair they had
the shop is very clean and the furniture is modern the walls are white i instantly felt at ease
if i didnt travel as far as i did i just would have left and came home
when i first went to this office he barley had time to talk with me about my rosacea spent a few minutes in the room then left
i only wish i had found him years earlier
i have never been treated so awful before at this clinic
at the consult appointment dr wilson put me at ease immediately
rio is good from what i hear but rlp is ok i just expected more for the price and was really disappointed in the amount of concern from the directors of the program
i arrived at the office and was unprepared to pay for services at that time because of what shirley had told me earlier that morning
the most important point to understand is how well they run their office
her downfall is allowing cheryl cook to be her office manager
the receptionist kim was so friendly and helpful
it is one thing that they messed up the appt but the fact that they obviously didnt care or seem to want to fix it was really insulting
the machine for the therapy was incredible
mason was greatstrong hands helped my tension
lisa is a thoughtful  precisionoriented rmt with a hugely diverse background in natural health  wellness
everything went well
they should have a lot that you can park in without having to pay
the haircut i wanted wasnt anything dramatic just a shoulder length cut from the awkward mid boob length i originally had
he is professional a gentle person has a huge love of learning and i have witnessed firsthand that he can fix a problem like tennis elbow in one session
im actually kind of sad today because dr fisch has released me to my obgyn
i sincerely appreciated the welcome i got when i made our appointment
she took me down the hallway  had me go into a little room with two lockers  some gowns to change into
at first they said the points would be restored by the middle of feb then the end of feb then the middle of march
despite surgery being delayed by two hours emergencies do arise everything was handled promptly and courteously
oxygen bar at the venetian is excellent
in summary id recommend telehealth if you need to make heads or tails of your symptoms and dont have access to the internet or maybe if youre a new parent or something
i enjoy the time as she provides a comfortable and calming environment
this is where the real fun started
like i saidcall around
shockingly one popular surgeon in town actually denied even taking me as a consultation because and i quote  my case was too complicated
welcome to healthcare in las vegas
at one point i even forgot i was getting my teeth out
besides all of that i gave it a chance without building any trust or asking me much about why i was there she just started putting needles in me this freaked me out but i went with it next she left the room for me to sit there not knowing what was going on with needles in my head i kept telling her this is my first time maybe walking me through it just a little would have been beneficial for me finally she came back and gave me about 3 minutes of reiki not what i expected and in between it all she let out a huge burp right in my ear
i have lost over sixty pounds and best of all i have maintained it
hahahhahahaaaha two stars
thats a direct reflection of the selamehs
when i complained they said they would look ito it but turned me over to a collection agency i just went on the internet and found out that they have been fined 10000000 for medicare fraud
had an appointment today i was clear with the lady who set the appointment that i needed the filling done same day and she said it wouldnt be a problem
why i stayed i dont know because this was far from a relaxing experience
unless you are paying for cash stay away from this place
i told the nurse but nothing was done in fact she did not even appear to be the least bit concerned
keep up the good work
very rude staff and drs that simply dont care unless your pregnant so they can make money delivering the baby
dr baca is very knowledgeable and wonderful
because of this we are not coming back
i just recently started a new job and had to get a form completed blood work all vaccinations up to date and she wasnt a walk in doctor that day but when she saw me she swtiched with a walk in doctor to see if i was ok and to finish completing the form
at my doctors office thought looked suspicious
he says yes do you want us to do work for free
our out of pocket would be 5800
dr heideman did not judge me going over my treatment plan and  worked with me to break it up in phases which helped me financially as well as emotionally
i tried the green goddess in a wrap and it was delicious
cheap water bottles for the apocalypse if youre wondering
this place is so disorganized and the wait time even with an appointment is at least 30min
we went to the emergency room here after my brother got bit by a dog
the saff was wonderful
i had diverticulitis surgery with dr bernascu   it took 5 hrs because of a couple complications im well on my way to a complete recovery
dr johansen passed everything with ease
again no apology
i think her experience is mostly in doing eyebrows
im a health care provider and naturally skeptical but ive researched the science of venus freeze and its a great technology that in theory really should work
i have had ok massage good massage and a great massage only twice in my life
recently i decided to live a healthier lifestyle
he was not able to cancel it and couldnt figure out whatever calculations he was trying to make on his calculator
it was too hard to book any appointments in other cities they were too far from where i would be staying and the times i did go in for an appointment i felt cattle herded and it was not pleasant
i have learned so much about myself and the issues i didnt realize i had
the care youll receive here is the best
i love this place and i absolutely recommend it but with a few caveats 1 theres no privacy its a big room
i had to get new mri of all of my spine
the office is so cute too games movies and stickers for the kids
a few years ago i talked to my primary care doc about weight loss and he just said eat 1200 calories a day and heres a months worth of pentermine prescription  the primary care doc plus script was like 200 out of pocket because i hadnt met my copay
they cnc staff were also very good
so i called the next day and spoke with a medical assistant and she said she would get back to me that day2 days later no phone call backso i called again and left a messagehere we are 8 days later and nothing
while at first i generally had pleasant experiences with dr lillo and his assistant those quality visits became far and few in between over this last year and it became more and more difficult to obtain a new script each month
ask for your rx and hitailit to a different office for your glasses
this was quite a savings over booking with the hotel tour desk they offered the same trip for 169
office is beautiful and clean
not someone i would want to have working the front
one of the best in the country
this place is filthy slow unprofessional has a very rude and uncaring staff and is just as ghetto as a place can be
dr blazer is a wonderful dentist and i am so glad to have found her office
i always have received the highest quality of care and professional courtesy by all staff persons
i get here at noon and they tell me im looking at a 45 minute wait
they dont even deserve one star
excellent and efficient service very personable staff
he is patient and very thorough
also they had no problems with seeing both of us so we didnt have to come back later
i was embarrassed and felt bullied
they dont have flyers either
the doctor came out to greet me and brought me back and began my appointment right then and there
kim doing stuff that dont make sense
the instructors are knowledgeable and friendly and the energy in the atmosphere is amazing
the last year has been more than trying pain fatigue balance falls etc
all they really care about is profit  not customer care
none of which i had experienced before so it was a great introduction to the therapies she was conversant in
she finally answered no
the pa took one look at the spot under a magnifying glass and assured me that it was a harmless somethingoranother
the environment is welcoming and relaxing
you will not be disappointed with their service and i thank them for the beautiful smile theyve given me
what a great end to my day
hes the most kind caring and loyal doctor
that said when i went back in to get an assessment from dr hendricks he and his assistant made me feel very comfortable
food for thought but i recommend them highly
the first one will offer balls and i think towels
sara is very attentive to my skins needs and always takes the time to listen to what i am trying to achieve
you dont want to see me fine
he will take care of your needs and answer your questions
i recently went back to red mountain and am back on the program and have been following in as described
the staff was friendly great doctor
yesterdays nurse and doc were fast and friendly but did not waste our time
at the time of my haircut i had very long medium thick hair
honest and very knowledgeable
just stopped by for a nebulizer
dr madder was amazing
my cancellation is due to an ongoing injury on my face that still hasnt healed all the way
i would be able to go to work and get on with my day as usual
i cant recommend this doctor or this office and i absolutely will never go back
all procedures he has performed have been quick and painless and thats something i definitely look for in a dentist
this is going to be my new nail spot
so the rude receptionist came over after 15 minutes of her obviously not knowing what she is doing and says that i will owe 273 out of pocket
their hours are until 8 pm as well
i signed in and was handed some electronic paperwork thing that barely worked
i was scheduled  over three weeks out
90 minutes of pure pleasure
finally a salon in vegas i can trust
aside from helping with my inflammation in my knees my bunion pain has diminished
thanks a lot for your help through out the years
3 the prices are affordable
worst experience of my life
im a hairstylist working on my feet everyday
i appreciated the honesty but when paying for an office visit i do expect answers or a referral to someone who can answer my questions
the atmosphere is very friendly
they are outstanding people in and outside of the office
put your stuff in there
also nobody pays attention to you here
they were very dishonest and had to call multiple times and spend many hours on the phone to finally get a refund
fast friendly service
my family has been using dr b for many years
my previous ob had retired so i was a new patient
and there is not enough time scheduled for the appointment because it was made as just a consultation
its been just over 24 hours for me and i have just the tiniest bit of redness  no blisters or bruising
i recently went in because i had been hurt while on vacation and was concerned about a possible fracture or break in my foot
i needed tons of perio work entire lower jaw gum grafts shaving down both sides of upper teeth from receeding gum lines plus a dental implant in the back molar
i go back every 6 months for my cleaning and i never leave with my mouth in pain from being stabbed in the gums like ive experienced at other places
the problem is that two people on the bus had late evening flights
he offers testing that enables the patient to take the right supplements that address actual deficiencies and restore balance to the body
she made us feel very comfortable with the whole process
lincare was suggested
i like how were on the same page as to making sure i try to be healthy
thats what i got too
from the first visit dr fulton and the staff made me feel at home everybody was very professional and friendly
i am now able to do these things with just the ativan and when i am able to get more work done would like an implant for another missing tooth he will be the one to do it
went to fastmed urgent care twice one time for upper chest cold issue the pa didnt exam me he said okay and prescribed me some medswhat an idiotthe second time had plantar fasciitis and needed a prescription for a boot to support my foot
in addition i cant wait to get my teeth cleaned again
she gave me her expert advice in pinpointing exactly what to do to achieve the look that i wanted and stuck within my budget
i do have to admit on my first visit 5 yrs ago i was seen by a pa i did not care for
i wanted to go home but i knew i couldnt
it was uncomfortable
i think so
this last time i simply couldnt shake the pain and i decided to visit dr lubitz based on his other positive yelp reviews
when i went in for my appointment the office staff was very friendly and welcoming
thanks to dr smith
das centrum ist wirklich zu empfehlen
for someone like me the savings could add up just might take me 10 weeks to get to that free bottle
i told her i want to go ahead with a regular cleaning and i feel the deep cleaning is unnecessary
she said she would send this to the proper channels
one of the first dentists ive had that actually tols me absolutely everything that needs to be worked on
i would come back here but im loyal to another studio
and he is an excellent masseuse
this is the best dental experience ive had
overall great experience
1032106monday i drove out to his office again  thank you cheryl cherihis other medical assistant for listening to my plight recognizing the gravity of the issue and acting on the spot to rectify the situation
in the early yearsthe office was clearly patient focus
he let me know exactly what he was doing and why which made me feel comfortable
i will never ever go to this doctors office again
september 2 2016 since my original post i have lost another 28 pounds and 20 more inches  this is one of the best things ive ever done for myself
the staff was extremely friendly and gave me a bottle of water while i waited for appointment
i will be looking for a new doctors office
this has never happened to me beforehorrible place how is that not an annual physical
the next day i took my baby to nextcare and they did a flu test strep test and a chest xray
ive been coming to this facility for about 10 months now and i absolutely love it
they never emailed me about my glasses coming in but i get all of their other emails
customer service was terrible
after several more painful attempts he says sorry cant do it
i was in a world of hurt and could barely walk  sent my whole body out of kilter
every diet is so get over it
basketball had michael jordan
she always communicates and followed up with every question and request i had
i noticed my vision has regressed so i called up lasik and apparently the lifetime warranty is only valid if i had done a yearly eye exam with them which seems rather pointless redundant and a waste of time for all parties involved
again i think a doctor is on the way
and close to awesome hospital
the cleaning was fine but the office shouldnt have let him work with patients
i was doing dermabrasion and have seen no difference at all i had a facial done somewhere else talking to the esthetician told her about my dermabrasion and she didnt think they were doing it correctly
while the dentist may be good the front office staff is not helpful
on numerous occasions i show up for my weekly shots somehow they miss my file and dont call me in
ill just find someone that actually honors what theyre supposed to
i am so unhappy with this place first of all its so dirty and the staff are so rude
i received a call from americas best once the glasses were in and went and got them
staff were very rude and unfriendly especially that one receptionist who yelled at my 8 year old daughter for standing too close to one of their machines and blood samples
sorry traffic sucks and dont call yourself walkin if youre truly not
everyone here has excellent customer service and truly care for you dental hygiene
there is something wrong when patients are treated like faceless cows
when i first started going to alameda crossings dental i loved the place i even referred my mom there to get her braces
dr graham has a new patient for life
dr mcgee is great
now 2 days later im in more pain than i was before my massage the staff was super nice but im not going to pay 60 to remain in pain
i by far feel like dr smith is the one
a pleasant surprise for an optical practice that i only found by going through my vision plan directory
always answer my question  concernsthey never make you wait for your appoiment there always in time
i called and left a message and they called me back answering all my questions
then it was time for my test spot
i purchased a groupon special looking for a good deal and location
horrible company to deal with
i have been searching for a good pediatrician for 3 years since i had my son
the dr at medpost just treated me like i didnt have anything wrong w me and sent me away even though i was telling him that i was having a lot of pain and it wasnt normal for me
but ive gone in for an annual checkup and follow up
he did a beautiful job and it was very reasonably priced
this office is only 6 minutes away from my house so that was a plus
we highly recommend scott for anyone with any somatic dysfunction and plan to see him next time were in town
back about a month ago 2nd visit they mixed his file with anothernow today he is back for some workand lost his file all together
i could have stayed for hours
i am beyond angry
i think its very important that children see the same pediatrician so the doctor really knows the child should any problems develop
i paid for 60 minutes of massage but only received 40 minutes of massage
i was surprised that they did not try to fix the situation when my friends are some of their best customers
how in gods name would i know from one sample if it builds muscle better than what im looking for which apparently is in stock at walmart
its literally like they want nothing to do with you once they get paid
was a bit nervous with doing cyro but tan helped me with any questions
im picky and ask lots of questions but this guy is the best
her massages are incredible
i wanted to leave and the lady told me that if i did she was still going to bill me for the visit
arrowhead has made my life worse from a financial and health perspective
the practitioner will never call back when you leave a message
however if its important to you make you book it at least a day in advance and ask about it when booking
no real physical blood work nothing
dr goldring is truly a leading pioneer of his field
after years of patronizing the north scottsdale top doc dermatologist i decided to try dr james pehoushek at the recommendation of a friend
the girl at the front was friendly and got me signed in quickly
i now have a 4600 bill with my health care provider due to the lack of communication and honesty from lifequest
and the message therapists all the ladys are expecting you to give them big tips or they will rush you and talk shit behind your back
if you are afraid of catching something in a hospital do not go to this one
we have full medical insurance my hubby gets through work yet we get all our medical care needs from her paid cash and not through our insurance i think that says a lot about a provider that families are willing to forgo their insurance they already pay for to get care from someone worth the time and money
again if you can get in to see herdo
i felt like a person in this office
to give me a chance to identify any problematic areas and thats about it
never have i ever encountered that with any dental practice dr in any state
im so happy i chose dr olson for my recent breast augmentation and innerouter liposuction
nice attitude and customer orientation
i always feel good after getting my teeth cleaned by her
waste of time and money
she paid attention to every little last detail
i thought she only got good looks but i was wrong totally
i was nervous being this is my first time getting the card
and the eye glasses dept is very good and friendly
this studio is one of the best i dont even know where to start
she is an exceptional healer and practitioner
we had enough to deal with having our young son in surgery
surgery was apparently a success and im now a couple of weeks postsurgery
on my next visit 2 weeks later the female at the front desk told me within a few minutes of walking in that the well visit would not be covered under my insurance which i appreciated
the people there were the rudest most disgusting people i have ever met in my whole entire life
i left relaxed and refreshed
great results as well
once i arrived the girl in the front maria i think thats her name was expecting me even though i was 6 minutes late
look no further for your chiropractor
i can understand if that were the only issue
shes very down to earth and instantly makes you feel comfortable and at ease
i filled out paperwork online so when we arrived for the appointment processing took less than five minutes
the team at simply skin is so professional anahit the owner  puts you at ease right away explains the process in great detail and i really appreciated her chatting with me as a lovely little distraction technique throughout the whole process
bottom line they over bill every time and if you dont stay ontop of it you will over pay
i called dr sheridans office explained to the front desk lady my situation that i had the other surgery scheduled within the week and she was able to get me in for a consultation later that same week
it was a great event i was able to listen to many different research fields in biomedical physics
roffi did an examination and tested my mobility and asked what i wanted to do with my leg in the future
i went home with smile and feel so much better
i went here after a car accident that was not my fault
i couldnt be happier
i took off one star just because i had to wait a long time the first time but its been great ever since
my dad passed away last may not long after returning home from health south
my main point is i dont think in the medicaldental practice you should be upsold anything
finally i came upon the following dr wladislaw fedoriw md physiatrist anesthesiologist pain medicine
i would highly recommend going here
im nachhinein erfuhr ich dass er auch die schmerzen htte dmpfen knnen um ab zu warten ob sich im zahn etwas entwickelt aber nein  bei ihm ging es ruckzuck
got there at 650 pm and they clise at 7 in the summer
broken achilles or not the big blue war machine still required me to tape in for my biannual pt test
then i was taken to get xrays and finally taken to the exam room
my first 2 visits were in person
they took care of my paperwork in a timely manner and i was seen by the rn only after a short wait
he is strong and gives great adjustments utilizing a soft tissue technique called trigger point therapy prior to adjusting
the staff was very polite answered any question i had and helped me with anything i needed at all of my visits to the office
terrible bedside manner and ultimately will give you a one size fits all method of treatment
the singh smile care office is wonderful
selbst an sehr warmen tagen bei einem gut gefllten tag herrscht hier eine angenehme ruhe
that way they have cash flow to work with before they have to give up the product
i refer people to presto doctor so they dont have to deal with the awkwardness of a waiting room or waiting in line forever to see a doctor that doesnt even care
our three year old daughter was brought by ambulance to this er and the staff had no idea how to care for a child
i was always worried some part of my body intended to be covered would peep out and say hello
then you are told they will come back to you with a breakdown for your cleaning
no surgery or anything
simply put fantastic
we always look forward to our dental maintenance visits
give her a chance and you will find how much she has to offer as a doctor and as a friend
theres no one better out there
i am an active person and my muscles are sore almost constantly and she really worked with me to restore my legs and shoulders and back
i am so grateful to have found her because she has really changed my life
he was mean when i went back after having severe pain following my 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed
i plan on getting my legs done next and will definitely do so here
i have been going to this dentist since i was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me
thats a pretty epic feat for me
but they changed packaging so i thought maybe i was only supposed to get one
easily a 10 star
all the departments are excellent as are the surgeons
they over book their appointments
the stylist seemed to be in a daze when she was cutting my hair and i had my glasses off and couldnt see what she was doing although i had a bad feeling because by the time she got to the front pieces of hair it looked really short
dr bryan is incredibly personable which is a definite plus considering how awkward the setup is whenever we see one another
they joked with each other but still kept it professional
we got there about 15 minutes early before our 2pm appointments to fill out some forms
i still have not heard anything
if i could give this business 0 stars i would
i  strongly advise that you do the same
he is by far the best urologist in the state
overall i am very happy with the office
ages 3 and 5 my kids who can be timid at time are always very comfortable in the office
the front office gal is always exceptionally rude
while we are sitting in your office j tells me over the phone while t is listening in that yes there are policies she has to follow and that if i had paid the full rate of the office visit on the bill that she sent without showing interest that i would have received a follow up bill charging me the interest
because of their actions they lost the procedure fee and any future business from me
dont expect to be seen until an hour or more after your scheduled appointment time even if you schedule very early in the morning before they have a chance to fall behind schedule
you cant bring up more than one issue within one appointment
i forgot her name but she is a mom as well so she had first hand experience on what to do
she was completely dismissive of every concern while calling me dear or sweetie or honey
well dr cooper refused to do anything
then the lady at the front desk reprimanded me for asking to have milk bottle labels printed when thats how it was always done through the duration of our stay it turns out you have to ask your nurse who asks the lady at the front desk lol
i used to see dr wilkinson who was equally friendly and very professional
the ownerreceptionist
thank you for a relaxing saturday morning
i contacted skyline dental through email sending them the referral a picture of the xray and the receipt
nirvana was the best experience ive ever had with a marijuana dispensary
they dont smile they dont say hi they just look at you like what do you want
i absolutely give her 5 stars im putting 4 due to the wait
the next day i met with the hygienist lynn and she is amazing
the receptionists always greet me by my first name and theyre so joyful
i recommend him to all my friends and family and i would recommend him to anybody who wants great care
i decided to make an appt
dr mumford took her time with me and explained everything in great detail she was so caring and kind
everyone at lone mountain dental treats their patients well
shame on her for being a disgrace to her profession
my insurance has been improperly billed twice
several years ago my mother now 90 years old was diagnosed with hearing loss
my wife took off an hour from work to be told once we arrived that we would have a 3 hour wait
i have been coming to this massage for about 9 months now about once a week
mr zaky is incompetent unprofessional lacks integrity and runs a very shady biz
the provider was great
this place makes me break that rule which is a huge deal for me and says a lot about what a great business they run
he shared he was also just getting over the same thing
i would highly recommend them to friends and family
as a patient i expect a doctors office to treat me with the same urgency as the doctor is portraying in the examination room
either way as loreal would say corny line ahead
i was greeted warmly by the front staff and dr zac himself introduced himself to me as i was filling out my paperwork
shame on you reach for not taking the time each patient deserves and giving them thorough exams and testing
from sleep quality headaches to even getting my job to set up my workstation correctly with support on my back keyboard aligned to my height etc
it has caused me more problems by the lack of quality they provide
best of all it was all very affordable
my body is a mess
though they have been closing donor locations this one is easy to get to and you are able to schedule your visit in advance online they also ask that you complete the health questionnaire the day of your visit and bring in your fast pass printout
i love the prenatal yoga class
the only downside to this gym is that it doesnt open until past noon on sundays
and i truly appreciate that
april concurred with this info and said that my order will indeed ship and i should have it within 2 days
they even offer a small discount to people who dont have dental benefits which was a nice surprise
costco charges 95 for the eyeglass and contact exam combined
while the front end staff was very nice and assisting they are not the ones responsible to make sure the equipment is working
the staff are knowledgeable and friendly
this time  not only does she see the pa but also a nurse and the md
i was originally scheduled to see the np but was told that they didnt go into the office today as scheduled and that i would now be seeing the doctor
great staff  very caring  careful and pain free
pat the dental hygienist cleaned my teeth and called the doctor back in the room to suggest a deeper cleaning
shane is very knowledgable and i felt it was a great decision to switch locations until my third visit there
but luring customers in with a cheap deal and then charging the heck out of them at closing time is no way to do business
bring a book
i did go back and all he said was that i had loose skin by my eye and if i want it fixed i would have to pay another 40000 i sent pics of my badly bruised face and i didnt even get a text or call to see how i was doing or nothing
i cant even remember when i officially joined this pb
we were not allowed in the back where his cavities were to be filled
so glad i found this great place
the vitamins and b12 made me feel fantastic
they come up with excuse after excuse and i am already tired of it
i am so glad i did
the guy popped my fingers and massaged so light it pretty much tickled on my feet
my daughter on the other hand gets to watch the latest box office hits in movie theater seating while waiting for her turn with mr thirsty
the guy was attentive and helpful
i go to balance for both massage therapy and acupuncture
my wife took me in here to seek help for neck pain and headaches that i have been having on and off for about a couple of weeks
the dentists dont make up dental work that they want you to have done to get the insurance money either
i have been wearing the same contact lens prescription for 15 years and assumed everyone just dealt with uncomfortable contacts
he listened to me and was very thorough verifying the extent of the injury
everyone really does their job well
as soon as i walked in the staff was nice
he is nothing like the stories you hear where the doc is in at the last second pulls the baby out and is gone before you know it
that is simply not true
doctor basically called me a crazy person instead of helping me with chest pain
they truly care about my dental health and have taken the extra step to make my experience in their office positive
to make a long story short i ended up over at next urgent care to get treated 8 stitches and they got me in and out with no hassle and took awesome care of me
the doctors are not motivated by personal gain since i found out they are on salary  not commissions and kickbacks
simia is one of the most underrated psychics in the valley
was very short with me wouldnt even go over my results and basically said he couldnt find anything wrong with me and that was that
the warm towels were an amazing treat
i have recommended friends and they have the same fantastic results
woke up friday to intense pain in a front tooth
im a 20 year old male
its great to feel welcome somewhere that is generally considered uncomfortable
i wish there where more reviews from people in general because you dont know till you go through it
i had a broken nose and he did a great stitch job
mine approved a procedure after it met the minimum criteria to make it a medical procedure
saved hundreds at costco
fantastic gym for what it is
this place has multiple doctors but only a few rooms that they share together and thats why they take so long
the rooms are outdated and smell funny
the hurtssogood master
she had the guts to tell me that the dr was running late and she was still with a patient and after that she was going to lunch
my teeth looked perfect when i left no more stains nor plaque between them and there was no scraping involved like at other offices ive been to
i was here for varicose veins
now they are holding the credit on my account that i paid for and refusing to refund me
lack of communication for weeks regarding a late fee
i was put on an iv and not taken to a room for another 2 hours
drcarr is a favorite
been going here for years and i couldnt ask for a better facility with such great people especially when im ill and need care
not only is she affordable she has great bonus packages you can purchase for a savings
great office atmosphere everyone is fun and helpful and they plan your appts if possible 3 months in advance
i am very thankful for the effort she made to cover my questions comprehensively
someone told me it will get better
friendly people and they teach you about whats going on in your body
further the closed tube method requires that the person stays in the room with you to manually control the water flow of water into and out of your body and in my experience has felt much more social than therapeutic kind of like going to the salon and chatting with the hairdresser
i temporarily set it in place reforming the acrylic and zinc oxide eugenol to temporarily cement it
maybe i am being unfair maybe she was stressed not having a good day or they were running behind but  i am a medical provider myself and i expect my staff to be representative of me in all facets of the patient experience in my office
my experience has been fantastic dr bakerink says the most informative insightful and caring advice in our 15 years of pediatircians
im beyond pleased about getting my femininity back
ive had too many massages where i explain my tensions and focus spots and feel i walked away paying a lot of money for someone to massage me based on a 60 minute get it all done time frame
i wish i would have read the reviews on this practice before i made an appointment because they are all pretty spot on
no matter what i am always respectful of the doctor and the staff
its rare these days to have someone in medicine that you can clearly understand
my daughter had stitches done and she was a nervous wreck
ive been to several locations st rose maryland pkwy etc and this one is the best
really enjoyed my time there  the office manager is a hoot too
id say this is a reliable place to go for a great massage
dr mcculloch put me at ease answered my questions and addressed the options in a way that i had enough information to make a informed decision
i should have walked out then
i asked several times if there were any other fees they said no and kept quoting this fee
i recommend him to anyone and everyone who will listen
definitely recommend this practice to everyone
not impressed at all its all about sales
kind and also explained everything she was doing and how it all worked
clean as a whistle staff was welcoming checkin was hassle free
i would highly recommend him
well worth it
the burden of insecurity has been lifted and i can finally live without worrying people are only seeing my nose when they see me
dr farian has been my families dentist for ten years
i have been a member of this gym for a few months now definitely paying an elite membership fee of around 100 and had mixed feelings about it until last week when i received a rare treat  an interaction with one of the managers in this place some tool called dave carnes
still this banner md anderson cancer facility does a great job of providing a pleasant environment
whatever it is they have my loyalty
what can i say this place rocks
the most recent incident was today where mom brought our baby into the office because she was in a lot of discomfort with perhaps an earache or teething
i recently had a baby here and couldnt be happier with the hospital
they do an interesting facial assessment report which screens your face for wrinkles texture uv damages and a few other categories
i definitely like things on the deeper side and she seemed so pleased
dr le was very professional and personable
jennifer is amazing
i  got right on the phone again with coprate years after kevin who was awesome was no longer with the company
both doctors who helped me were very patient and helpful and took the time to listen to my concerns and answer all of my sodding questions
this is a third rate office driven by greed and incompetence
an older lady was there to keep track of who was waiting for whom and called out to you if there were updates from the doctors etc
this is our first pregnancy and we did have questions
great staff and clean facility
the staff is wonderful friendly and attentive
mood regulation milk production assistance just overall feeling so much better
i 100  recommend  lori for doing your lips  i had a bad lip job done at another place and she made mine perfect  and took her time and was very gentle   thank you lori  im very satisfied  with  my new lips
people lie to me all the time to get free items
unbelieviable and very disappointing dont waste your time
this is where my son gets his glasses from
i saw sheila tack and she was great
i added hot stones in the mix as wellyou have the option to share a room with someone if you like
23 minutes later a very friendly pa came and saw me
guess i just have to get a refund
i was born during the day but not yesterday
she said okay bye bye
as a patient of southwest medical i saw several doctors throughout the process none of which i had ever met before and they were very brusque with me
then i get a call today saying that i owe 590 because my insurance doesnt cover cleanings and the lady also mentioned the fillings which im sure my insurance covers 100
people dont understand that sometimes there is a wait time
some time later i googled my old doctor and found out shes right up the road
no problem for dr falcon
felt more like i was being pawed at and pinched rather than massaged
are you kidding me
with the membership your credit card is charged automatically for one massage each month at the membership price
she knows her skin especially the stubborn kinds
open on sundays too
all in all im very happy with my new dentist
the staff was very friendly and informative
i recommend all my friends here when i mention my services
we got to our appointment on time and they make you pay upfront in the beginning which fine if youre getting good service but thats not what we got
i gave birth to my twins by vbac in march 2016 with dr harter
going here for about 3 yrs with my son
he was so quick and so amazing
not only did she misdiagnose my condition she injected me in the wrong part of my body according to an md
went to her room and she was not there
i called yesterday to make the appointment with kate in the office who was very nice and who was going to call their previous dentist for their treatment plan because i did not know what exact teeth the previous dentist recommended work on
of course insurance didnt pay and the dentist didnt try to make me pay but this seems a little shady to me and backs up my suspicions that this place is a bit greedy
i didnt even get any quotes at other offices because i was so comfortable after my initial consultation
this has been a very painful year for my teeth and dr jeff and his staff have taken incredible care of me
i had antibiotics being pumped through ivs for 7 days
he helped her through the process and made her excited to go back for the follow ups she needed
these people are money hungry
i argued with the lady because she says it takes 6 to 8 weeks to process
kimodontics is the best
i love her recommendations for after care  how i feel instantly after adjustments
in addition  i was asked to come back to get my test results  no mail or phone calls for results
no brace no crutches just tape
he is an amazing doctor so amazing that i drive 45 minutes and take three different highways to see him
get there asap
after he hands me this magical pair of contacts he takes me back in and says im a perfectionist when it comes to contact lenses and i think i can get them even better
dr daub and his staff made me feel so comfortable with no judgement whatsoever
which im not able to because i have to go to work
it finally caught up to me as i had terrible tooth pain a couple weeks back
i broke my prescription sunglasses and it has been 14 months since my exam and i cant get new sunglasses without paying for an exam because my insurance covers and exam every two years
the facilities are clean and the staff friendly and helpful
beachcliff dental associates of rr informed me of this when i got there but decided they would cover the cost of my cleaning xrays and exam
i felt that dr richer  his staff genuinely care about their patients
with the information i gave her and that she put together she created a treatment using the needles guasha and fire cupping
now i have to say that my son is a happy baby loves people and was flirting with all the ladies there lol but towards the end is when he started to get restless and began to cry
i have gone to dr maynard since i moved to the valley in 2002 and have been nothing less than thrilled with the offices professionalism kindness caring and genuineness when it comes to true concern for me as a patient and a person
we are always taken back on time unlike other massage places
very disappointed by the way she communicated with patients
as a medical marijuana patient are you not entitled to those same rights when visiting a doctor to receive your recommendation
the office staff are always friendly and helpful
anyway i like the deep tissue massage
my next concern are the medications safe for breastfeeding
rainbows end is a great place to stop in at
apparently she thinks her name tag has god on it
the oral surgeon says this other tooth is decayed why didnt the dentist fill it
the place is clean but it should be is new but from the moment u walked in the front desk girls seem to have no knowledge of a really sick person
he has allowed me to continue the treatment program on a fixed budget because he cares about his patients
it was clear that my health was her number one priority when she rescheduled my appointment not once but twice due to my eyes having an allergic reaction the first two times i saw her
i came in today for a tooth extraction a top left wisdom tooth extraction to be correct that i broke and like most patients in this world i absolutely hate the needle and feeling any sensation of a tooth being pulled yes i am a huge chicken
qc is the best
great place must try
there are lots of choices for orthopedic care in las vegas and im glad i got it right the first time by coming to see him
jillian the massage therapist asked all about my needs and reason for coming in
all i needed him to do was to apologize on behalf of his staff to one of their patients who in good faith put his health in their hands
i know that some procedures can be painful but they make sure you are okay during the whole time you are there
i just wish their back office staff would represent them in a professional and fair manner
i dont want to quit ever
overall his 25 adjustments are worth their weight  or more precisely your weight  in gold
weve been very pleased
i have had the worst service regarding my membership for over a year
if i could add more stars just for her treatment i would
i couldnt imagine dealing with them if i actually had a billing issue if i received services
i called and left a message asking for them to call me back so i could reschedule as i had been waiting outside for over half an hour in 100 degree weather
to add insult to injury michelle the front desk person said that she called me the day before to confirm my appt time
after a few months i unfortunately got my hair done by someone else because i didnt like how midgi put them so far from my scalp
my husband and i both wanted some good pictures for the grandparents and other family
she never answered nor returned my call
i am going to be heading here first before going elsewhere
what i love most about this beautiful woman is her connection to you
they give the kids treats like stickers and necklaces balls and rings when the appointment is over along with the toothbrush essentials
i have been back several times
he saved me 200 that day and my family and i have been going to floss dental ever since
i reserved a couples massage for my boyfriend and i on a saturday
i am 41 years old and i believe that acupuncture helped me conceive on the 3rd try
i do not recommend this place
ive never been late in the 3 years ive come here
no surprise we returned them today under the lenscrafters 30 day satisfaction guarantee
i had raved to my daughter how wonderful this place was
i also had to have blood drawn today and went in earlier than my appointment time
i asked dr amy if she would be iras dr and she agreed to do so
unless ive just been missing something i already know what doc i want to handle the serious stuff and i havent met his equivalent herenor do i have much hope of that happening
she said doctor wont be able to see my son because they are already closed
i definitely will be back will probably be my go to besides my main one just cause the other one we have a membership there
this is the third place ive been to and i found my shop
texts you to see if everythings ok
how is it they cant tell me if they take my insurance
the staff at this office is very professional and very nice
she has treated both of my children age 4 and 2 her calm and caring nature allowed my children to relax and receive a complete and effective chiropractic adjustment
he is very knowledgeable and devoted to his clients
it is very evident that she cares
i find the associates to be very helpful
i feel like every teacher is a personal trainer dedicated to helping their students enhance the quality of their practice with each class
they were able to get me in and out
we first started going due to dr chiles and loved him
with a dermatologist instead
i did it to get into shape before my wedding and let me tell you it totally worked
she didnt know where to go from there so she said shed have the manager brenda call me and confirmed my phone
many other nicer places to go
dr racheli wish i could remember her last nameanyways shes very sweet and made me feel comfortable and important
i went to 2 different dentists to get it glued back in
this lady called me from the centre and gives me a lecture about how i should make 90 min from now on and justifying her employee
amazing in every way
doctor petermann is an educated genuine and honest doctor whose practice far exceeds any other office ive attended
is this what vegas healthcare has come to
great med spa
the staff is super friendly and courteous
they were very informative when i would call after my surgery for the loads of random questions i would have
i will be a patient for life
i highly recommend skyview dentistry
she ended up cutting my bill by a few hundred dollars and i walked out of there for the last time
imagine that  a dentist who actually fixes teeth
while visiting az from ca at the end of december 2015 my elastic chain on my upper teeth came off two teeth
also after i packed up my things to leave i asked her what do i do now because no one told  me what i needed to do before leaving and she rudely said i dont care what you do and repeated herself when i tried to explain
i let them know i was only there for a cleaning and that i wasnt experiencing any issues other than jaw pain most likely from grinding my teeth
i specifically asked culinary insurance what they cover in the exams both glasses and contacts the rep replied a few times by telling me i only pay a copay of 20 for both exams
of course we always got a different answer from everyone
my neck was worked on for maybe a few minutes
if you are scared of clowns you might want to go somewhere else
i used to have terrible skin with blemishes and scarring but seeing carmen has totally made a huge difference in my skin
i cant believe they would put someone on the floor like this
anyone and everyone at any of the pain clinics that work for the clinics can see everything you post and nothing is a secret like they state
just so everyone knows they charge 45 for a full set with gel polish
i cant say enough good things about the staff in that unit
it did take 2 hours which was excessive
and i definitely shouldnt have to ask more than once
maybe if they stop talking with their  coworkers in the kitchen the food would came faster 3 people working in the kitchen and they dont have no clue how restaurant business work
his staff aims to please especially trudy and eric at the boca park locations
i recommend you make an appointment today you will be pleasantly surprised with your experience
nice and friendly environment and stuff to keep the kids entertained
then you lay down on your back and they give a head massage and work on the nexk area
i have been going here for a year or so now and they have done quite a bit of work on my teeth
he also recommended to go back in a month since my top lip is still slightly larger than my bottom lip and would need another half a syringe to make them equal
my glasses need the lens replaced but i also had a broken fish line that holds them in place
fire those dumb ass females you have working your clinic if you want to stay open
love the knowlegdeable staff and the way they pay attention to your individual needs as opposed to a being just another customer
we tried local utah dealers but could not find anyone to help in our price range and specific needs
vpc has amazing drs and nurses
i was called to the back at 1025am
he will for sure be my go to guy when i have any kinda aches are pain
btw his bed side manners are impeccable and his secretary is awesome
after what happened to our daughter we took our son to an honest dentist who told us our fouryearold son was fine and any tiny cavities he got wouldnt matter because his baby teeth would be falling out
the reason for the poor rating is the abundant presistant advertising of products neither asked for nor necessary the inabilty to schedule time and fill out forms using zipdoc  warn me i am wasting my time filling stuff out u do not use or look at and last but not least for not listening to your patient and not leveling to explain why something is done or entrrtain alternatives
dr j is hands down the best
i would recommend this dentist office to anyone
my only complaint was that during the time i went the selection was limited
i made it very clear at my visit that i did not want a membership and that i would come in and sign a contract if i wanted a membership later on
you will be wasting your money
ive been dealing with chronic pain for years from competing in sports and more recently from a motor vehicle accident
well last night my daughter came to me crying about her throat hurting
they claim that i owe this money for a no call no show and not canceling an appointment within 24 hours
finally i told her i was a new student to the studio but have been doing hot yoga for a while
a witty doctor that cares is a rarity in lv and must be witnessed in person
for starters its true they seem to opt to refer you to specialist unless you have a simple cold or allergy and all you need is an rx
have better things to with my life then wait in a waiting room
they always went out of their way to make you feel as comfortable as possible
thank you best dentist ever
the extended clinic hours allow patients to work around their busy schedules and the onsite lab is also very convenient for ordered lab work
i have lived in las vegas for 10 years now and have only been in for an annual twice in that 10 years
also the customer service was very good everyone was very nice and accommodating
dr i is extremely knowledgable and communicates well helping the client understand what dental concerns he has and the best course of action for treatment
they were all old like i am and on medicare but geesh everyone deserves to be treated with some respect
we were sick for over a week so something had to be wrong
we paid 499 for our package 2040 for limo service each way 4060 for the pastor no pictures can be taken by you or your guests in or out of the building ridiculous priced photo packages and 19 added to everything they want to get you for
i cant say enough about this office
she encouraged me and helped me to not slip back into the way i was
now theres multiple families waiting
i called for an appointment and was so pleased by the reading she gave me
friday morning i had bunion surgery done at the mountain vista medical outpatient surgical center
i havent had health insurance in about a decade and went in for my first visit
while they do take walkins an appointment works much better
i felt 90 better after my first crack
it started off with both pair of my glasses progressive bifocals having the reading portion incorrectly placed
dont trust what you are told about finances billing and payments due
everyone who works here is amazing the secretary the hygienist and the dentist himself
i miss it so much
the office people enjoyed telling me they placed people with later appts ahead of me
i can understand a mixup one time but two times in a row
as i was researching a new dentist i realized i forgot to review this place
her card readings have been life changing and her reiki is amazing as well
everything you need to meet your fitness goals weight supplements educated trainers
first off i feel the need to share that the two actual doctors here are predominant hivaids doctors
i was very comfortable and happy with the results
every time we have gone we have had micole neely pa she is the sweetest gal ever
dr osullivan didnt show up until almost 6am
the first visit there was quite a wait maybe an hour
we have had some pretty scary emergencies and he has given us his cell phone number and is always there to help us
fast forward a month or so and i receive a bill from them saying i owe for the xray
my sister and i had a therapists named michelle ortiz i believe
we were shocked at the way she spoke to us and never once smiled
never ever i will be back here again
we were offered a beverage as soon as we sat down which was very nice
dr glassman has an outstanding staff blanca at the front office was awesome and so funny my mom and i were the troublemakers haha
this decision coincided with the hiring of a new surgeon in their practice
mayo has a top of the line staff that are the best in their fields
at my last appointment she removed my nexplanon
i do still believe that dr schweda is a great doctor
thats all that matters
can i rent the table and room for the night please
again one stop medical serves
i came in at the walk in clinic on a thursday morning for the purpose of refilling my prescription
what i got was a salesperson trying to sell me a name brand athletic shoe that i could get for 12 the price at a retail store
i came in for a deep cleaning
she took me to a room where i could lie down to have it drawn
i have never been so disappointed in a dentist in my life
ive been to other professionals for botox and it was a hit or mis
a month later i get the same pain sharp pains molars i go back for an emergency visit and the dentist says i cracked the third tooth behind it which may have got infected
then she did a little massage on the rest of my legs and it was over
im very passionate about my teeth and was terrified about finding a new dentist
anyone and everyone needs to switch their dentist to dr rouhani
they were just too lazy to do this
she gave excellent pressure on all the right places
im so happy with my results i could cry  he and his entire staff at the hankins and sohn office those ladies are the best nurses i have ever met in my life
look forward to working with you again
dr hall is wonderful
angela milafsky of clinique massage provides a terrific deeptissue therapeutic massage
the mri techs are very friendly and willing to answer any questions
there are 4 rooms and only 2 room dont have any issues
3rd doctor john kastrup disregarded his oath to justice where the the physician is swearing that they will avoid any voluntary act of impropriety or corruption
if you have to have oral surgery dr carlos letelier  and his staff are an exceptional choice
i am soooo happy that my friend recommended her
after some debate my gut instinct told me to run not walk away from this doctor
id highly recommend this dental office for anyone looking for a good dentist in the valley
no waiting times in the lobby
he explained the issue in a level i understood
such affordable quality work
my daughter said that it hurt when they did the x ray shes had x rays done before and has never complained of it hurting
felt confident after discussing treatment plan and thrilled with results
thank god for the amazing doctors nurses and surgeons that saved my life
been attending lyons physical therapy for almost 3 months now
i had a very positive experience at this office
im hoping for a good result and i will write more
also the other girl my son hadshe was quite nice but not too competent
with my insurance copays etc i paid about 10000 for everything
they arent the only people whose time is valuable
saleslady says no problem the system shows there are several in stock
i dont know how its possible that after all of the time hes been practicing medicine he was still able to make us feel like we were the only thing that mattered when we were in the room
first the receptionist was telling a client to not eat brussels sprouts because they were so high in calories and fat
the staff is friendly kind patient and courteous
heaven here in peoria
we will be living in our home until my husband and i are put six feet under
i felt an overwhelming sense of warmth as we were all greeted upon walkin
thank you so much to you all

im surprised to see that thereve been negative reviews about desert view family medicine since my and my husbands experiences have been nothing short of wonderful
they are really fantastic at taking care of their customers
this town has absolutely no professionalism or common courtesy
avoid this place at all costs
if youre still looking for a dentist no matter where in vegas i would highly recommend coming here
i am not sure if other dentist offices allow you to watch tv while getting your teeth cleaned but i am able to put on the game show network which doesnt work to well to yell out the answers but its still great
after my massage my masseuse said you are flexible lucky for me i was because your normal joe off of the street might have been in some serious pain during and the weeks after the working over i received
during my first visit with dr thomas i did get a copy of the treatment list for my records
so he gave us a handful of samples and said we didnt have to purchase one since we were only in town for a few days but we ended up purchasing one anyway
will be going back in a month or so to get my upper cleaned and relined
after they called me back i was given a thorough exam by the assistant and dr stephanie johnsonomgi can see again
the place is awesome i couldnt recommend it anymore marcey always takes care of me and makes sure i know exactly whats going on and what to expect after my visit
he runs tests finds out what is actually wrong with you and gives you options but lets you choose
some pain still lingers due to the severity of my case and he recommends me for several months of treatment
anthony is the clinical assist he helps dr huish with dental work and hes the master crown maker
she did a great job and i highly recommend her
the office is clean relaxing and runs efficiently
being in the healthcare field myself i did extensive research both online as well as asking  fellow healthcare professionals who they recommended
i am a dental assistant and because of regularly being on my feet and sitting in an uncomfortable position i often frequent reflexologists and massage therapists but this will certainly never be the business i choose to get these services at
i kept telling preston  chiropractor dr wu that it always felt different  uncomfortable when preston set me up vs another staff member who was more attentive and made sure she did her job correctly and prestons response was youre just sensitive today
definitely some of the best care i have ever had in the valley
thank you so much
after having been misdiagnosed twice the provider evaluated and treated me
my boyfriend and i got a couples massage here the other day and it was amazing
the staff is very friendly but i do not like unexpected bills when i am told that my insurance covers the bill and then a month or two later i have a bill
the most outstanding part was the caregivers who provided loving and extra care to make my mom feel special
hes professional accommodating and puts you right at ease
they are all so caring respectful and informative
its a great experience
but he seems really genuine in his apologies and i did return
massage therapy can prove extremely helpful in dealing with the effects of cancer treatment such as nausea and fatigue
its old and not in a great area but once you walk into the office its actually quite nice
i didnt want anyone performing dental work on me that wasnt confident they could do the job well
his office staff as well as the dr are all wonderful
highly recommend him to any who need a dermatologist
i found this place from my insurance website and was calling for the doctor to do a physical
recovery wasnt bad at all slighly uncomfortable until waking up from a nap about 3 hours later
she worked for several years at cor de valle and now has her own place
i highly recommend  dr angelchik and his staff
the rude man that did my dads mri yelled at him for coughing
good solid comprehensive eye care center
we talked for a while reviewing my medical history i never felt rushed and most importantly i felt listened to
after a serious illness out of town that required several days of hospitalization we contacted our new healthcare partner physician nebelsieck at the direction of the hospital to get in and see our primary doctor immediately and here is what happened 1 we called from the aircraft to alert doctor of current situation and was told the doctor  was not around
i chose them for an initial visit based off my insurance providers website since they were listed as accepting new patients and most other places like the mayo clinic had wait times of several weeks to months
i will not be back to this location
based on my experience  i would strongly recommend not going to thomas dermatology
start to finish in the surgery suite was about 10 minutes
when i asked why
otherwise they are extremely flexible and accommodating
this is best er
walking in the office is inviting and the staff are welcoming
i trust dr robinson completely
great service and their love for children radiates through the whole building
one minute later the dr came in
after bashing obagi nuderm system she convinced me to try a different skin line
at times the other persons attitude may seem rude but there could a reason for it
whenever my husband and i visit las vegas we get foot massages
i looked over your chart very carefully they both said
they look and feel great
no follow up appointment was scheduled to discuss the results
i have been to the gilbert office and phoenix office
i feel the oriental foot spa is better than massage envy
he also oiled and checked spring on other door made adjustments to our garage opener
who cares about the patient
ive been going here for years
i dread going to the dentist so going now makes it a whole lot easier
your parking lot is a disaster
to my surprise it was my permanent retainer
jaron the pet tech was so kind and attentive
as i waited the 2 hours to be called i was surprised to see how comfortable some patients were to be loudly discussing the series of pain meds theyve tried and which ones they were going to just tell the doctor ive tried them before
she definitely knew what she was doing and explained her techniques what she was doing and how it helped
do yourself a favor and choose vegas weddings
poor customer service does not equal repeat and return customers
my boyfriend has been getting his hair cut by her for years and she does a fabulous job on him
i have had a problem with a tooth for years now and have seen 3 dentists about it
kudos to the front office girls
normally i wouldnt advocate health care that takes less time than pizza delivery but on my last visit the physician figured out a problem i had seen my primary care physician for two times without any headway and sent me to the er where they said my gall bladder needed to be out post haste
i tagged along with my sister and then came for myself twice
the np gave good insightadvice and we opted not to do a ct scan
she asked me if i had any concerns and questions a few times in my exams
i had some other issues about my health that i was very concerned about and he said he could not do anything about it until he got my old pcps records from nevada where i used to live
he didnt even stay in the room long enough for the chair to return to the upright position
first they just lay you down on a bed and start
i rescheduled for the next day with another therapist assuming they would comp the cost and apologize but they called me just before that appointment and offered me 10 off
my friends and i are in town for the weekend and we had found this place on yelp after an afternoon of day clubbing
i didnt take a brace or crutches from the hospital because my friend had a similar injury and brought his brace and crutches to save me money because i am a student
i couldnt even walk out of the place on my own unassisted what if i had fallen and hurt myself
he is a true asset and deserves to be recognized
i feel valued every interaction i have with her down to the post treatment texts she sends to see how im doing
i went ahead and called to see if they could help me remotely not expecting much
it was as if our presence offended her
i really wish i could give them no starsthis is the worse place you could possibly go toi went in for a dot physicalwaited 8 hrsthey kept taking people in before methat arrived many hours after i arrivedthey made me feel like i was a inconveince to themthey are super expensive and dont take my insurancebut i needed my dot and i didnt know other places to goat the timestay awayyouve been warned
ive trained at all times 4am midday after work evening and it never feels packed
we were the last session for the evening and the photographer made us feel like she just wanted to go home
i left disturbed about the entire experience but glad they didnt touch my teeth
i had some back problems and had to be sent to another location to get an xray due to my insurance not allowing coverage at the health center but it was alright
poor customer service
i wont recommend it to anyone
and still get great service
i would have to come another time
i found this place on yelp duh after a long day at the office and decided to give it a shot
ive been going here to get my tattoo fadedremoved
