everything was going well until we discovered everything was dirty
overall nothing worth coming here for except to say weve been to guy fieris burger joint at the linq
you cant go wrong with any of the fusion rolls but i love toronto volcano and black dragon
i really wanted sushi as i had just had a baby and it had been a long time since i got that craving met
it wasnt expensive but it isnt cheap nor should it be
cheersget the bloody mary
the food was great prices were reasonable and the service was toonotch
he has his own private label of wine called bastianich sp
the prices were cool and satisfactory
dont think well go back
that spicy grilled cheese that james invented is gangster af
i bought a 10 logo plastic cup with which i was supposed to get a free 16oz juice or smoothie which didnt happen and when i called her on it she rolled her eyes
get over yourselves
the fooooodthe food is something indiscribable
my wifes cup of chili was supposed to be spicy but was neither spicy nor hot as in temperature
i was looking high and low for powdered egg whites target nope walmart nope whole foods nope
its close to where i live and i go there once a week in the late evenings
but at least it was intimate enough
i cant say enough about this place
i hope the service isnt like that most days and honestly avoid the jerk chicken wings because its not what you might expect
as for the lobster tail it was very pretty but no flavor and on the rubbery side
the goodwe now have a new business in peoria
great sweet potato fries
and guess what
we waited nearly an hour for our food
it was a bit chilly to sit outside but we could see the water show from our table
we all shared the bacon wrapped eggs which many reviewers suggested and did not disappoint
youll be pleasantly surprised
it was new for me to have a real meal in addition to painting but they made it work
the decor of the place is awesome
when we were seated an hour later i was confused by the kilts on the servers
its that good
we were taken to a table right away which was to be expected
i did notice a textural oddity and realized that they had put white button mushrooms in the dish
she took it back to the kitchen where we could see the cook arguing with her about it
it is almost like an adventure because you never know whether youll taste something tangy sweet or savory
local tip if you show up when they open 530 for dinner without a reservation expect a 515 minute wait
good beer and whiskey selection
definitely something youd expect to find in a lifestyle center where every restaurant is only slightly different than the others
i got great satisfaction in writing eat shit
tao is way too crowded and pretentious
they run food without knowing what table ordered it
artichoke toasts with red pepper and garlic aioli  simple clean flavor
when we very obviously didnt
lazy dogs and wolfgang pucks next door has never steered me wrong though
a lot of old customers does not know including myself that poke express is no longer there
clean and neat decor
he asks what we need and we again repeat why we are there
im going back today to try the burger with fried egg
the food is without a doubt fantastic
went to crabby joes after a little shopping at walmart
the calamari steak skewers and garlic shrimp appetizers were good  especially garlic shrimp
the entryway is swank with an interestingly textured wall perfect for selfies
16 in the stadium was an experience i will never forget
ok on to better things
a must try
i really am digging the signlogo of the restaurant
i love all of the craft beers they have on tap makes it a great place to try new beers
other than that there were no complaints for the place except that you cant expect happy hour time to come with a waiterwaitress even if you are sitting at a table by the bar
i confronted the bar tender and told her that my check was incorrect and she then went on to tell me that she billed me for me and my friends order and that she had already processed it and it cannot be reversed and asked if my friend can just pay me the money for my his meal
pepper jack brat was good
the food is always awesome here and customer service is great
noise level was surprisingly high though the restaurant was pretty full
once my friend to her first bite she was hooked
its some kind of bread sponge material idk but i had it on a taco and it was pretty amazing
they asked my family to come join in the fun
i opted for spicy salmon and it was delicious
prepared medium rare it should have been tender but it was a bit too chewy and had a grainy texture
there was a mix of college kids and families enjoying a pizza dinner
service was not great
the maine lobster salad and the rack of lamb were tasty but the corn soup and the halibut were subpar
ok i went for food not alcohol
waiter was extremely rude all the time any time we need sth he says i cant do 7 things hold i will be back bla bla bla
great food incredible beer and great times
donut holes okay but wouldnt get them again  not sweet enough
awesome service too
might have to have a splurge weekend
we were a bit disappointed by the taste of the food
its been a long time since ive had a really good knock off my boots and keep them off
both were excellent choices
the poached eggs were overcooked and the salad that came with it had way too much pepper for my taste
it was cold and just not that appetizing
regardless of what you order theres always a lot of it and all high quality
this also means the griffin is a smoking establishment so be warned
i wouldnt try to go for serious salsa dancing though that place gets packed
they have their signature fried chicken roll and bagel roll which i loved
after ordering we did not see out waitress for a long time
the shishitos it was good
we broke the rules by ordering the chocolate covered bacon as an appetizer instead of dessert and i recommend everyone trying this
when my bill arrived and i clarified the owner vicky stepped in and was so brash i could not wait to leave
ive definitely had better but we really had a nice evening
0 star to this venue for poorly handling their nye event
their food is pretty good too
this place looks like it was designed by a high school prom committee
clean and relaxing inside of a grocery store
our server dismisses our concern with our missing order not arriving even after an hour wait and it never did arrive
get the firecracker shrimp
my husband continues to rave about the fish ceviche and says its the best hes tried in vegas
went here with the family for lunch
just would call it pretty good
das essen ist sehr lecker und superschn angerichtet
i also ordered a high life on tap
the cups were ice the tables were ice the bartender was nice blah blah blah
i read a great review about the place by a professional reviewer claiming that it was similar to san francisco chinese food fare
the tuna tar tare cones were amazing
loved virgils ambiance and their selection of food and drinks
the desserts were now kind of disappointing
he claimed it was the one located inside the mob museum the mob bar
beautiful fun friendly outgoing fun to joke with awesome energies and attitudes and did i mention beautiful
to drink i had a sparkling saki which was small but very good if you like sweet drinks
definitely a good budget stay
i ordered the duck based off of reviews on yelp and the waiters suggestions
unfortunately my fries were overcooked and lukewarm
the decor was oka bit dark for my taste that always makes me think theyre hiding the dirt in the floor
small pool area and they packed this place also with no room to hang out
im guessing this is an area thats better suited for those who want to mix and mingle while not having to talk too much over the sound
baconstrips baconstrips baconstrips baconstrips baconstrips
brought home two desserts for the teenagers and for us to bite intowho were we kidding
first up a palate cleansing sorbet
great beer list and everything we tried at my table was excellent
not to the liking of those who tried it
been here once
it felt like she was wanting us to leave so we did
kay got the bbq chicken with papaya salsa and i ordered the spicy basil soft shell crab
our waitress casie came over and saw that i hadnt eaten much of it and asked if i wanted a box
if it werent for the acoustics and the crowds id give this place 4 stars
it was so tender and flavorful
she was awesome
i got a 34 lb burger fries and fried pierogi for take out i hate sitting in that extremely noisy place
i forget the name but ask for the darkest beer and you wont be disappointed
was very happy with the experience here
it was atypical in terms of general dim sum options but still retained the basic essence of cantonese cuisine
we enjoyed all of the rolls we tried and found the fish to be fresh and the service to be friendly
sandwich had great flavors and sitting on the patio was beautiful
the pork belly was tender on the inside with a crispy exterior
had the fancy bison burger with goat cheese was delicious service was great the place was nothing fancy but clean
we were all pretty quiet during our late night snack
i have used entertainment restaurant issued coupons and restaurantcom for lunch and never been refused
dont remember but i think there were about 8 different ones to choose from
one time michelle took care of our table and her service and hospitality were great
the big highlights though were the mochiko fried chicken the creamy tempura shrimp the short rib dumplings and the roasted shishito peppers
it was made for you
easy to get a window table since it was monday service was very prompt and friendly food was great
it really gets to me that everywhere in this town charges at minimum 35 corkage fee and even worse they only allow a 2 bottle limit
other rolls can be found marinating in mayosoy sauce and or excessively deepfried
great little place in one of the best food areas of phoenix
we could smell them as they arrived at the table
i am from san francisco bay area and have been missing a  fresh seafood place to have a lobster roll or crab sandwich
the clientele was lacking as well
very small corner restaurant
i dont see a need for the bacon at all and i actually prefer it without the bacon but this probably a big bonus for many other people
in my expert opinion  and by expert i mean i eat food here are the things that could be improved hash browns very generous portion but cold and kinda mushy
its a gem of a dive bar
the hostesses were very friendly and personable
each piece is a pretty substantial size
id have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers
thankfully google to the rescue
we had to speak to the manager peter who addressed our concerns whole heartedly and remedied the situation and addressed our concerns
great service and food in a really fun setting
i went to flying fig twice this weekend
i wouldnt go out of my way to head out to parliament again just to visit this place though and i probably wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless they found themselves in the area and didnt mind paying 30person for good not great food
it is a great place to watch afternoon golf or other sports at the bar
three speed is my favorite hangout spot since ive moved to the dovercourt village
comparable price as other places that sell macaron
they describe it as a huge portion but honestly i couldve finished the whole thing by myself
they also allow you to change up the ingredients in the smoothies to you liking
id like to see more selection sauce but i mixed the hot with the sweet and got a very nice sauce for the brisket
espresso churro with milk shake  this is such a cute dessert perfect to share for 3 people
the restaurant has a very cozy and intimate atmosphere
we have never visited a bww but our family swears by them
only knock on this place is its a bit small
it is hip and sexy but also romantic
i had to hit the bathroom twice over the course of the evening and the mens room was about what youd expect from a place like this
i cant say no
carne asada taco  this was my favorite of the day
must try the kumamoto oysters
be sure to check your statement after you visit this place
bowling was a bit pricey but we had a blast even dressed black tie style direct from the tiara ball
eh it wasnt the best
the decor is very modernnightclub and the place seemed to be very popular with young professionals
we planned on just having appetizers and drinks not a meal
we ordered a chocolate chip cookie sandwich with white chocolate macadamia nut ice cream35 and a taro and almond milk tea4ea
all of the food items would be pretty standard quality for any other japanese restaurant but pricier nothing memorable
rico and buen were the reason i came back on night 2 and erica was the cherry on top
we also ordered a side of eggs  bacon to accompany the waffles we ordered
bathrooms lotion hairspray and mouthwash
the host told us w had to wait about 10 minutes for a table because they were waiting for the open tables to be cleaned off
my friends used to live in the loft above south paw
best part was the orange apricot vinaigrette which i ordered on the side
i can only hope the kitchen is cleaned better than the bar but i wont be taking any chances
for 5 you can barely get a small on any other day
walked in to a clean restaurant and welcomed by the staff
strongly recommend el chorro
the fondue was terrible only 3 pieces of chicken beef shrimp each which charged 35
we ordered a roll combo  some other sushi
i had the beef enchiladas which were just meat rolled in a tortilla with a little sauce on top
when it was time for dessert i was already stuffed but i was curious about the lychee sorbet
i dont really dig the whole thing restaurants are starting to do lately the multiserver thing
its called the fathers office burger
lots of beers to choose from and try plus the food is really good
a nice trendy place with good service  delicious sushi
cant wait to go back and try their coffee and food
ironically they provided no wasabi with either roll nor ginger
lately i have found the quality has gone downhill so i have given up on cheap sushi and go to solo sushi bekkan which is just around the corner on grosvenor or japango dundas and elizabeth
but it is the fried chicken sandwich i had on friday that made me write a review
actually i couldnt tell any differences between kayaks whose price is half of kanpais
we had dinner at libertine social last night and it was honestly the best meal i weve all had in a long time
omg its the best
i would strongly recommend this restaurant to friends and family
most disabled people do not go to movies by themselves
i checked them out this morning not super busy but their location is somewhat hidden unless you know about this plaza
so i told them id rather cancel it
the interior and decor has a great italian old school vibe to it
aside from the bruschetta the salads are wonderful all of them my favorite being the italian picnic
you get a large portion of rice and veggies with dinner that is great tasting but a tad salty
my waitress was eh ok i guess
get here early
but ive found the portion sizes lately disappointing
worst hamachi salmon albacore nigiri that ive ever had
i love the antler chandeliers and the moose head over the front door
saw this place highlighted on top chef masters and knew that i wanted to try it
the chef actually finally came to our table after our friend requested that the waitress remove an item from his check because it was basically inedible
djs are amazing
you heard that i was starting over with someone new they told you i was moving on over you you didnt think that id come back id come back swinging you try to break me but you seeat sushi samba
i wish they told me what cheese was meant for what wine
even the standard baked potato was delish
not greasy at all
i tried helping him polish them off but we barely made a dent
i came back recently for my friends birthday
i wouldnt have disliked the dessert as much if they didnt call it a souffle
the fires it came with were also great
the bartenders are always nice and helpful
weve been many times as a large family and with friends and every dish so far has met expectations of all who have gone
we even caught a glimpse of rocco himself
well we were looking for something with a short wait so yardhouse  lbs were out and so we turned to hachi
the music was very loud but not a big deal
the taste is not very authentic
love this place
i love meat and i enjoyed the burger so theres that
being a chinese i want to say this is the most authentic chinese food i found in pittsburgh
also the food is very true to the dining experience we had in germany
the craft beer selection here is always changing and their prices are pretty on point with anywhere else in the area
nothing is left to chance
this place is owned by the same guys that own fuel and fuddle  one of my favorite pittsburgh restaurants that holds many great memories from my college days at pitt
but ill be back
three of our party of five were served their meals while 2 others had to wait about five more minutes
however i again chalk this up to growing pains  still a fantastic experience overall and one of my favorite places on the west side
the chiliflavored tuna tartare that seems to be a perennial staple on their menu was just gross to me and the brunch burrito had yummy melty pork belly that was ruined by an odd green curry sauce
i love it and so do my kids
the cocktail list is wonderful and i had a cohesion which was like a kicked up last word which is one of my favorite cocktails
food  the food is a bit above average but what really makes this place is the amazing side sauces
been waiting for this place to open for so long at last i get to try it
i ate every bite and sadly did not have room for the 6am which i really wanted to try
she was so sweet and very attentive
theyre only open from 5pm2am but hey youre in vegas youre probably too busy gambling or shopping during the day anyways
our favorite place to eat in vegas   great sushi beautiful decor  great music
laugh till your face hurts  and your ears are ringing and the world is spinning and you want a morning after aspirin fun kind of place
prices are reasonable and service is generally reliable
obviously the waiter had not picked up the food in a timely manner
the menu has their standard fare and then there is usually a page of special items that change seasonally
my salad had a bug in it
this was my favorite place to eat until today
its about time i was starting to miss their food
the furniture and accessories look like it was donated from the goodwill in the 60s and has a cabin like quality
and a refreshing blood orange sorbet
pretty much always my thought process
the drinks that came out tasted good i didnt try any margaritas i had to drive home next time atmosphereservice it is a pretty neat place to hang out after work
this place rules
this place is great if you want to grab a drink and an appetizer
this place is bad bad bad
family decided to go to this place as we all understand that their lunch till 330pm
it also came with octopus and squid which ive never seen in your standard 6 piece set unless im a delusional nyer and this is standard in toronto
the downside of the restaurant is its location im sure it would be busier if the location was different
food was exceptional filling portions and very tasty
im going to use justine hs rating categories food 5 service 5  ambiance 5 overall 5 i love the cool decor and vibe of this restaurant
i complained and when they said they would cook the vegetables i said noway
we waited for our drinks for 20 minutes then ordered our food
they even had a reggae dancehall night and that was amazing
with big thick seat cushions
i made reservation for tje thxgiving weekend
sure theres tons of booze flying by and it can draw a bit of a rougher crowd but take the kids in for a hotdog on the patio at lunchtime and its better than a ballpit
the quesadilla was a bit better but still the jalapeo marmalade was way too sweet without the kick of heat needed to balance it out
so we trekked back upstairs for quarters but we didnt use them all because we couldnt take the heat for long
the only thing good about this restaurant is the view
the noodles were too thin that was what i got i didnt get the option to choose thick noodles i believe thats all what they got
what a cool idea
i think my total came to around 50 dollars
theres no drink list but we just asked for the most favoured bevies and were rewarded with some burbon chai concoction that was like fun iced chai tea
you get great portions for the price and its always delicious
suffice it to say this was a very disappointing experience
there was a poker game going on at the back of the bar and owners are definitely from sd  booo
theres a pretty extensive menu for rolls and the usual nigiri and sashimi
its not worth your money or time
they have always been friendly on the phone regardless of how busy they are
frankly when i looked at the menu i was a bit worried that they were not charging enough for the food to be goodyes the prices are that low
i got banana french toast which was very nice
on a more forgivable note though the interior comes off as modernly minimalistic and clean which is the bees knees
the service at houlihans is the slowest of all the places ive been to in urbanachampaign
just a quick update  i returned to barrio heeding my own advice about ordering the double to avoid the rocks charge
will definitley come back
kiddo mostly shared our food and also had a side of rice
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbachiburgerlasvegas3zjm4sbaxtnr8crrcyhdeg i split two burgers with my brother
they had a lot if flavor and were juicy and tender
he was rude and argumentative
really cool place
go to got sushi or ra sushi they have juuust what youll want
we were told our entree would not be taken off our check because the manager denied it took an hour and a half for the food to be delivered to our table
this place is our favorite
they all are attentive pleasant and just there to serve
the only negative is the servers sometimes have attitude
i just gotta remember to wear sunscreen next time
first time at this restaurant
excellant food and service
the salsa appetizer with daily made tortillas was an excellent appetizer to share  although i usually prefer my salsa ingredients diced rather than blended it was still very good
most places in matthews arent open till midnight on the weekend much less on a tuesday
we did ayce and once again no sashimi for all you can eat
yay finally a boba place in a mall
we never did get the third sushi roll
i forgot to get a sandwich of that though
that and my hubs appreciation for their generous unagi servings
the food wasnt bad but it isnt a place to take a family
such a lovely experience
i first learned about half moon when my barber told me he goes there to watch the ufc fights because they dont charge a cover
ate here fir a friends wedding rehearsal dinner and loved it
it certainly wasnt worth the cost of this dinner
food heres a list of what we had  miso soup i know i know
she looked at faintly and said yeah yeah i know ill call you
i guess that makes up for the free tickets for ladies anyway
today i stopped in for a pint and a light snack
there is so much crab meat in these tiny bites of awesome
we ordered a spicy tuna roll and their guru roll
apparently the waitress didnt feel like that was enough so she added a 20 tip to the card charge
we had 4 people so this was perfect although i do love the jjang pong tang because i could enjoy the soup itself
within 10min our buzzard was going off and we were being walked to our booth
the blueberry cheesecake was belowaverage for a dessert as well
we did not get any
prices are ok maybe a touch high but its vegas everything is high
and to top it off the service was crap
it was so good
what a breathe of fish air seeing new food at ayce sushi
they were like tempura onion rings and i highly recommend them
the waiters were talking in groups for 20 minutes and we were still not seatedi asked 2 speak to the manager again bcuz he never came back he was looking as if im  getting on his nervesi ask him why are we not seated and his waitress came and interrupted our conversation  really rude and blew her breathe at mei asked her if she had a problemshe was so rude
once we were seated we were advised of happy hour starting at 1030 which is awesome
dancing on the bar yup
will definitely be back when i am in the area
spacious floor plan where your table isnt on top of the family next to you
but i really like the way that this place is set up
great music and girls wearing next to nothing dancing on tables
the meal ended up to 34 for 2 ppl will definitely come back and try other food soon
its in the same parking lot and just a few stores away from nothing bundt cakes
despite being there over 3 hours and having numerous things go wrong  manager was in the elevator on the way down as we were talking about how bad the service was and didnt say a word or offer to rectify the situation in any way again food wasnt bad but isnt as good as the original location
having the staff fill individual glasses is ridiculous
while the omnis have the pick of a fantastic menu theres only about one veg option in each category of food
within twenty minutes i started to have symptoms and was sick for two days
first they did not have any soup even though it was offered with every dinner on the menu
my husband had a pasta dish with a light red sauce and sausage and french onion soup
it was topped with the most tasteless guacamole that seemed to be prepared with edamame
we got waters and asked for lemon but never got them
first off this place is the pits
they said that they had run out of aioli and offered me mayo
my first visit to a simon restaurant and it was wonderful
hell of a dinner rush and she was able to be prompt witty and attentive
it wasnt a busy night so i dont understand what was the big deal
not too thrilled with the mandatory valet
hot food and cooked food is average
i came here on a saturday night
this is your typical fun piano bar experience
this hasnt seemed to reach the masses as ourselves and four other tables came winebeer in tow only to be turned down upon arrival
of course since we ordered ayce we wanted to try different rolls through out the night
their fries and stuffed jalepenos were pretty good
both of which i heard were also very flavourful
they have a really nice food menu ranging from hearty sandwiches to loaded burgers to wings and larger entrees
you know how there is a difference between being in a parking lot and being in the dumpster
their taproom is nestled in an old firehouse with imaginative chalkboard art on the walls and ceiling
the service is quick and amazing
still one of my favorite hang outs in the east valley
try them grilled as well
the seafood tasted almost like it had been sitting out for a while
i was the only one at the bar and the bartender said nothing to me for over 30 minutes ignored me the one time i said anything just to break the silence
mara g remembered him from the grand opening  six years ago
the food itself was good but not overly filling
the chimi was one of the best and the marguerites were on point
it was late and she wanted to eat sushi
service is good
cant wait to come back
definitely will be coming back on a regular basis
i thought bartenders are supposed to be social or at least somewhat nice to their customers
i think ive finally eaten at all the hickory taverns around town now and i can say that theyre all well run and they all knock out pretty standard items well
i was happy smiling and laughing at my stupid jokes
then you add toppings they allow you to get every one if you like i got it all
so why only three stars because the menu and staff can be misleading particularly if you have allergies
the only thing we liked was the teriyaki box with steak  this was a one time only visit and never again
my husband feels this place isnt appropriate for takeout food and perhaps he is right
wo gibts denn sowas noch
we finished with the  strawberry tiramisu
the subtle green tea flavor could be tasted strongly in the aftertaste despite the passion fruit flavoring
had some rolls
good burgers great drinks
i have lived in phoenix for the last 6 years and this place is amazing
bar is ok not hip with drinks
they run around 17 if i remember correctly
highly recommend the egg rolls for a starter
bottom line great modern and natural atmosphere service is attentive while not overbearing even near closing
if youre going to hit vegas anytime soonput the capital grille on your vegas bucket list because this place is operating at a championship level
maybe this isnt fair to the auld dubliner but from being a patron who has spent 15shot for paddy who has purchased a bottle of jameson on more than one occasion who has had fooddrink bills over 200for two people i feel like i am more qualified than most to either recommend or condemn
as a business owner myself i would be appalled if my employees treated their customers this way
huge portions of modern pub food like ahi tuna burger or lobster sliders
stayed away from the steak and cheese like some reviewers recommended
our server was extremely attentive and approachable
great service and amazing food with a large selection that will please anyone
when you think of thin crust pizza you do not expect dried out cracker thin crust
this casino is nearly to stratosphere
die hard floyd fans might be more into it but i think there couldve been some better song choices no money
i had a drink called gin and juice cucumbers strawberries gin and splash of soda
i had the oreo pancakes which were delicious but a little too sweet for breakfast
price was good too
love the popcorn on all tables love the friendly staff they all work together to cook bartend and wait and mix between themselves and your tables decor is nice and best is the sweet potato fries
happy hour is always fun
it was a huge amount of food and came out to 18
the full bold flavors stuck with each bite
overpriced and unoriginal pub
the rolls were reasonably priced as was the rest of the menu
the fish is not fresh also the taste is a bit weird
with a name like smoothie king i was hoping to find smoothie worthy of a crown
im guessing the service will get better once everyone gets the hang of things
it was perfectly seasoned and i could have eaten a bowl of it
they are great
we were staying at the hotel so we reviewed the menu in the room note the listing says casual dining but the prices are equivalent to or more than the upscale restaurants and headed down
our waiter saw and apologized on his way back to the kitchen and then took it off our tab
spiked warm apple cider
they do that 50 times and they make a pretty good livingwhatever we got lucky there
luckily the onion rings were as good as they were because the steak was superduper yuck and the fries were forgettable
they have some amazing sliders meatloaf fresh burgers and more
ok so i dont want to rate this place poorly but  im just gonna say ive been here and its a good stop over with friends for a drink and maybe if you want to try the food that is perhaps prepared under dim lighting and served under the same then youre about as likely to want to audition for the next season of fear factor
i came here two nights ago with my girl friends
ive actually never heard of this place
the sushi is always fresh and they are open late
there was also a small dance floor with a decent dj
the liter steins of beer are also the greatest
after were were seated it took the server 10 minutes to acknowledge us though she had only one other table
the sweetness of the dipping sauce really gave this dish a beautiful balance that just really engaged my taste buds
just call them short fat ribs instead
i cant believe i lice down the street and this was my first visit
lobster salad huevos estrellados bassoprahaaaaammazing lol
this is a great place to relax with friends and family on the weekend or weekdays
it comes topped with whipped cream and has a lovely flavor maybe amaretto
food is the worst in cave creek
i would highly recommend this place for anytime but if you have the opportunity to come here for happy hour take advantage of the opportunity and enjoy
the people who work there are nice no attitude and are actually very cool
after i say no for the thousand time she gives me my bill when i havent even asked for it
this month the so
we started with the polenta fries
the fact that this place consistently has quality ingredients like this is unbelievable
but if you want great service fun environment and something new and delish please please please drop by the strangely and properly named improper pig
its the kind of nightclub youd see in a classy movie
burger and fries were decent overall
dottys was just a little too packed when i went and it was hard to get a conversation going or even hear myself think
sometimes weve had great experiences with the waitstaff and other times they have not been friendly at all
great cocktails little bit pretentious names good prices cool atmosphere
my dad thought his carne asada was dry
one said it was super mangoy
we asked her if the rest of our food was going to be delivered and about 5 minutes later everything else was delivered
i like this hotel and the staff was very friendly but its really important for me to be walking distance to the clubspool party i plan to attend marquee xs
that is all i can say
they know how to celebrate a special occasion  had dinner here with 4 friends to celebrate 2 birthdays
when we first arrived here the place was empty
a little on the stiff side for some of the staff but our waiter was very nice
it was wonderful dining al fresco without thousands of cars zooming by
the mexican food was standard fare
we ended up buying tshirts from there as our souvenir from las vegas and the bartender hooked it up with a bunch of matchboxes and stirring sticks
everything had good flavour and taste
sushi was yummy
if you are not fortunate enough to dine during happy hour everything is reasonably priced
however unless you are in peru you are not going to get large ceviche plates for cheap
kim was great
i found the pool itself smaller than the average
i enjoyed the experience
the fries were great as well
wont be coming back unless someone else really wants to
unfortunately my boyfriend informed me a patron left a swastika on the mens bathroom wall
this is always our go to restaurant
so keep rockin it out winghartsthat awkward heart tattoo wont stop me from enjoying your obscenely good burgers
i ordered with a medium heat of 5
the girls rushed over to me and said i dont go in there
you have a circular card to indicate whether you would like to take a break or continue dining
when we came in we were immediately greeted by the bartender
there are tables and booths and its nice yet very casual
overall all the holes are well maintained especially being out of season and the staff was well mannered
my favorites have been among many of the seasonal german based beer that have gone great with their standard burgers and sliders
stopped in for lunch today
according to current bar owner mrs hotz babe ruth franklin d roosevelt and the cast from the deer hunter including robert deniro have all visited hotz
also being able to have surf and turf chicken and steak options is a huge plus in my book
i took my parents and wife
lots of interesting dishes listed
great selection and surprisingly good quality buffet food
the creamy cashew milk is definitely my fav
food was worth it menu selection was great
lets start with the bruschetta you get to choose 4 types so we went with 2 tomato  fresh mozzarella 1 mushroom  gorgonzola and 1 chopped tomatoes  roasted garlic
crowded and hot
now they have just a couple of the modchairs left as accent pieces and it actually works
i cant wait to come back
the wait was about 1520 minutes
we were set up at a table and waitresses whose attire can only be described as bordello chic  brought over more ace of spades plus belvylet the bottle poppin begin
at this point she starts getting really angry with me well you are gonna tip
if they remove them from 8 decks and replace with small cards 2 3 456  thats in advantage of dealers means house advantage
the servers where friendly and always onhand with another boozy beverage
what more could you want
so far the food is great here would definitely come back
needless to say our tab was over 300 and experience was horrible
buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing
we soon realized that she was switching shifts but by then amy had taken our apps before they were done my husbands meal plate early  a friends drink with wine still in it
the problem is las vegas is miles from any reasonable agricultural area or the ocean
if you dont plan on leaving luxor to eat dont want to eat from their food court or at their higher priced restaurants this is a good place to go to
with so many beers on tap i had no clue which to try first
i went there one june evening with a gay friend
this restaurant is a hidden gem
first time solo
after i arrived it took the server about 8 minutes to come by
i have no idea what the one i got was called but i enjoyed it
the bad its super loud
the decor inside is really fantastic
right away i was greeted
i went here once last year with a group of 15 people friends  work and we really go a great service and good food
three visits in the past two weeks has given me a pretty good handle on lucky foos though all have been for lunch and brunch
the music that night was awful 90s and early 2000s rehash from the dj and boy did it kill the atmosphere
also note the pastry cart is not assortments you can pick from a tiered tray
but the burger was good
also love the decor and music
its just solidly yummy and the service is outstanding
sometimes i order the ichiban sushi for 13 dollars
my dad sends his back
i stayed despite that
service is always great and the waiters and waitresses are always super friendly
the comparisons between jogoya and pacific seafood buffets will be inevitable  as they seemingly offer a very similar selection im not certain but i would bet they are the same owners
how i rate  i try to be a tolerant patient and polite person
they have a great mixture of new and old
4 a lot of the plates curtains and chairs need to be replaced
i also love that they cater so heavily to vegetarians and meat lovers
when i say epic i mean roll me out of the restaurant and nap all day after a full on food throw down
update we have where others have been less than favorable in their reviews
detox me juice is good a little on the ginger side but tastes good comes orange  in a glass bottle and around 9 bucks  recover me taste good pinkred 9 comes in glass bottle firewater has jalapeos but not really spicy same 9 bucks comes in glass bottle  smoothie had the coffee one wasnt bad i was on the mend so didnt have full force taste so i cant be an honest judge on that comes in a plastics cup with a big straw
street tacos the best
prices are really high due to the name
best dog friendly bar in phoenix and its pretty human friendly as well
this place is super cool it even has an arcade with life size connect four
as someone who put myself through college by working in the service industry i have no patience for lazy and rude servers and it really irritates me when i go out to eat somewhere and am treated like i am an inconvenience for the one serving me
it was rows of different ingredients and tossed together in front of me
order a giant beer and have a good time with your friends
the prime rib was cooked just right and the price was reasonable
came here for a cocktail reception so i didnt need to pay for this event
and the italian godfather esque music that was playing down there
i was pretty embarrassed in front of the woman i was dining with
also enjoy the customer service and the pretty waitresses
i love this little bar and the great people who work hereown it
would not get it again
it definitely feels homey and relaxed which is an atmosphere i enjoy
just like the scottsdale location the food was awesome
the wings and fries are always on point
die inhaber haben viel wert darauf gelegt den scharm des alten hauses zu erhalten
tacos came with rice and beans
we started with our drink standardsannie with a vodkatonic and me with a ketel dirty rocks
i arrived at 930 on friday and was seated at a table for ten and waited ten minutes but nobody came to take my order
all in all if youre looking for a good place to get some very fine sushi this is the place to go
it was very spacious and had a country side rustic feel to it
we chose to have two of each
i was sooooo excited that cracker barrel had made its way to the valley
however their food left quite a bit to be desired
black leather couches invite group conversations around an open bottle or three
second the margaritas we had during this last visit were less compelling than i remember with more tart than tequila
im really bummed about my experience since i had read really positive reviews
the rib steak was fatbut the mash potato was awesome and the beer
the hotel is fantastic to great decor comfy clean
maybe 5 minutes tops
located next door to a brewery youd like a place like this would have a tough time survivingwrong
beer  6  the meal was pretty satisfying and tasty enough to order again next time
it seems that you get less food when you do take out  i have noticed you definitely get less veggies and less meat
12 of what i had was amazing the curry fries yum
we had a little bit of everything in our group but many people ordered a pizza or a burger and they were fantastic
very good service and a good place to watch the game as they have big tvs all the way around the bar
we did the full 10 course meal with wine pairing
best sashimi ive ever had by far
lately ive been doing takeout
the portions were really good for the price and the service was great
service was unfortunately very lackluster to say the least and ill go into that later
i just wish the meze style platters were smaller
ribs i ordered them with sauce on the side so i could control how much sauce were on them dry rub is also really good mac n cheese so good
the menu was a little confusing
great prices cold beer great selection of margaritas and other drinkiepoos and yummy food to go with the drinking
it was straight cut to the chase no friendly service at all
if you are a cat person you likely already know the vast spectrum of kitty temperaments
the dj was pretty good played mostly electro songs
however the thai beef salad was basically a salad with beef
i understand the place is called melt and they specialize in cheese but it was overload
unfortunately the night i came there was a postponed baseball event so i never got to stick around to feel the vibe of watching some sporting action
my man is a huge metal freak and he loves brunch so i figured this was the perfect combo
i come to expect a level of professionalism when paying a considerable amount for a meal and unfortunately the experience was just not up to par on the prices they command in that ice teas were brought initially and then never refilled after the meal had started
the band is amazing as well
if your place is able to charge 500 and people regularly are willing to pay that then by all counts dont sell low
i must also declare to you that we dont have strange willing on food
see you again soon
so i guess me and bad daddy have a truceand ill drink to that
there were no wheat bagels so i settled for a plain
nate my bartender was awesome
my girlfriend wore her coat the entire time we were in there
fun sports bar
stopped in for happy hour with a friend  was not impressed
i also tried some sliced steak and ribs the ribs tasted a little left out from lunch or reheated but the sliced steak was yummy
nice service nice place
the lunch special is definitely the way to go i got dinner to go for the first time and it was pricer than i expected
also the prices did not match the quality of the food
the boy had the 8oz filet mignon which had a weird tinlike flavor about it
the quality of the good was good
too woodsy though
he looked so confused
a lot of good looking people and vibe of la belle  la boeuf makes this a must visit if youre in your 20s
malees is my favorite thai restaurant in the valley
we were both ready for another drink and sat with empty glasses for probably 20 minutes
i come here pretty much everyday my kids love this place but tonite i stopped by on my way home and this owner for some reason decided to give me attitude bcoz i had to look at my phone and see what my orders arehe walked away and acted like he was busy and decided not to help me
now that i have eaten at house of ticks i understand its charm
ordered a strawberry basil lemonadewith gin and it was pretty good but the food was just perfect
yes tobey i love this bar also
we had our parents 50th anniversary party at stone  vine and they couldnt have been more accommodating
we were acually seated at 730  the most pleasant experince was the food which was very good but our waiter barely had four interactions with us
i was in town on biz and stayed nearby so i had breakfast and lunch here in one day
did not taste good
thats customer service basics
waiterswaitresses disappear into the back and sneak back out without making eye contact to provide the absolute minimum service required
the menu had only a cucumber roll and a garden roll that came with egg in it
the portions are fairly generous the price isnt so bad for an area that lacks several poke options the fish is fresh and the topping options hatoptions
i did not get the chance to try the pizza so i cannot comment on that
i really like this place
45 shrimp  salmon cake again presentation was notable fresh local ingredients perfect balance of flavors on a bed of lightly dressed arrugula salad
theres nothing better than street tacos from a sketchy part of town
for the price we paid it was sub par food
theres even a little picnic area in back where you can bring a date throw a blanket on the turf and enjoy a bottle of wine and some grub
the place is large and had no trouble getting a table on wednesday night during dinner service
the salad was on a very small plate and thats how i knew that there was no way that this was a dinner salad
price ranges around 615 for snacks  got the assorted pickles plate and the fries
then the server comes out and approaches the other table first
as we drove home and passed places where wed never eat  applebees olive garden etc we remarked that they looked pretty good compared to the place we just left
cheap drinks and an average entry fee seem ok though
anyways ill still visit the mississauga location but i hope they make the drinks faster in the future
both apps were out ridiculously fast and were ridiculously delicious
they have the best spider roll there
the food was hot and fresh and the prices werent too bad
i ordered the carnitas with tortillas and it melted in my mouth
makes yonaka during happy hour a rare find and well worth your trip off strip
my boyfriend also had a cup of the soup of the dayloaded potato
despite this major inconvenience not so much as 1 penny was deducted from our bill
we had the 18 fat uncle tony pie with the antipasti as an appetizer
a few of my favorites the stuffed cabbage the sauerkraut and the pierogies
nice location not far of the main drag of old scottsdale beautiful building and layout
it does charge a premium price though
finger snacks at best cheese tray store bought cookies and celery tray
i took home enough food for a few more meals
its buy one get one free
i love this place
in addition to the tapas on offer there are a number of sandwiches as well
food was delicious
this is due to their limited space
i was thinking steakhouse seafoodsushi etc
of course they give you some other drinks free but thats also why your friends are there too
so glad that we noe have more options on the west side
fine for a voucher but i wouldnt pay full price
best steak my wife and i have ever had
we arrived at opening i think 11 am  everything was fresh and everyone was well satisfied
we make sure we get there at the beginning of the happy hour because it gets busy and fills up quickly
all the while cackling about how much business they have and how much money they are making
this might be a great place to get a drink if you are ready drunk
seems the beer has changed from coors to bud and i can only order a pound of wings at a time as i drink
well let me tell you that when i ate one then 2 then 13 and had no significant feelings of the heat mentioned previously i was rather disappointed
ever since i ate here i have been dreaming about the dish i ordered
i went for dinner and was quite disappointed with the portion size
we both live singing and we very excited
if you have never been check it out
i believe the sign out front says that they open at 6am
i know you want to keep the  place clean as quickly as possible but if there is beer in the glass and someone standing next to it dont touch it man or ask
my moms chicken sandwich was burnt
as such its a great place to enjoy a cocktail and light snack or a full on meal
but if you go the day before the day of or day after your bday your free
i asked the hostess again and she asked the server but he told her he didnt know where they were
my wife said the pulled pork sandwich she ordered was so wet and unpleasant that it reminded her of her mothers cooking
the staff is friendly
i love the speedy service the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff
i usually order a plate of the irish nachos with blackened chicken
we decided to order filets instead
sometimes they have someone playing music in there too which is cool
we indulged ourselves a little and ordered the calamari fritta and the zucchini fritte
great find everything else was closed so we decided to do a littler forth of july dinner  great service by alfonso
we had the adovada burro and it was excellent
this place does one thing extremely well and did not disappoint
at la cave the dates were huge
save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day  delish
the menu is quite unique and as i dont remember some items
reasonably priced and a good variety
i was furious that she made us wait that long before telling us that she cant accommodate us
one of my girlfriends and i both ordered the chicken and waffles
definitely check this out if you are heading on 10 past goodyear quick detour but worth it
service was little slow it was a weeknight around 900 pm throughout the dining experience
this was my first time having a sushi burrito and it was amazing
why since there are so many better things to do around there like the bar  bistro for example
especially a new restaurant and on browns season opener in cleveland
but otherwise delicious
i think that ive found the jackpot of japanese food in vegas
margaritas are too sweet
seems simple but there are more than a couple layers of flavours and its not just a simple pasta dish at all
when our last friend arrived the same waitress went past our table checking on other tables beside us at least six times noticing my friend but not stopping to take her order or even acknowledge that she had arrived
its like a nervous tick or something
bar lounge sur saint laurent qui change des autres bars autours musique hip hop
it is on the linq strip so you can only access it by walking
the restaurant has not renovated they just dont want people to see all the negative reviews on there
for the price they were charging i expected a better quality meat
i also tried their burgers both times
ill go somewhere else from now on
if you are in lv you must try lunch or dinner here
very eclectic and vibrant
i went with the cod and bf picked the chicken picante
when i glanced at the drinks they were very reasonable
if youre just looking for a cheap place to hang out with your buddies skip this one
very relaxed atmosphere and employees are super nice
possibly the best crepes suzette ive had in my life and every single item i sampled from the dessert pastry table is outstanding
that is aboveandbeyond service in my book
this time i was by myself and i definitely dont recommend coming here solo
my family and i lined up for the weekly name your price tuesday special today
the raspberry was overwhelmingly sweet and extremely artificial the pineapple didnt have even a hint of pineapple and mine the chocolate mojito was absolutely undrinkable
fantastic brew selection and always rolling out seasonal beers that are just fun to try pumpkin porter was yum
gute lokation zum party machen
we sorta stood around for a little bit trying to figure out how things worked
after coming to the realization that no one was coming we flagged down a server who said he would take our order to our waitress
i had the salmon and my companion had a steak  both delicious and cooked just right
its a russian mule type of drink and my mom got the mango daquiri
saltys wont be my goto place for happy hour or mexican food thats for sure
staff behind bar very friendly and sociable
it has a great outdoor patio and looks like it would be fun for a night out
the chef came out to make sure our curries were made to our satisfaction and spice level and checked to see how we enjoyed our meala great touch for people who dont eat indian food often
two things would make this a 5 star experience 1hot butter on the popcorn
we ate here on our first night in montral
we had i love my ass roll as well which was awesome
everything was done to perfection
first week of december 2013  we stayed at the aria and they gave us a 100 gift card  because my husband had a birthday that week to spend at the crystals shops or restaurants
a gang of ball cap wearing bieber wannabes who were loud and loaded dominated the mood
referring to the gilbert location
great place for company outings date nights or to celebrate your birthday
today we are officially juicing after this amazing meal at evo
it was 650 for an entree 2 sides and a drink
yep its a bar but you would not know it when you taste the food
will definitely keep coming back
kobe beef patty with tempura avocado and sweet potato shavings
although since ive never actually been to new orleans i could be way off base
i do not know what caused it to be wet  soggy but ive never seen such thing in my life
the atmosphere is awesome
however i dont think i would visit here normally because for the price
the service was top notch
you can get it in a bread bowl
until i finally said ok shut up we are going this instant the thing that stood out the most was the friendly staff
if youre in the mood for loud and messy and kinda chaotic its a fun place
i got salmon sushi as well as california rolls and they were both out of this world
underwhelming is the best word to describe everything
i have been to this place a couple of times before
albacore sashimi  super fresh and served with a nice light ponzu sauce i didnt see the check so i can not tell you what our meal set us back but based on how happily my brotherinlaw paid it our meal was obviously worth every penny to him and thats all that really matters to me
the food was exceptionally good but the price was a bit high
otherwise i wont come back for it
la distillerie n1 est plutt petite ce qui en fait un lieu trs convivial
so tasty and the corn was wonderful
he was always there to check on us he got our drinks quickly and made sure we had everything we needed
he gave me and my mate alot of advice on other good local bars too which being from out of town we greatly appreciated
i dont want to give this place 4 stars but yet its not 3 what a dilemma
its just not in a very prominent location and as a result is never really busy
i am a huge fan of breakfast and ordered the pb
we give dresslers 45 carrot cakes out of 5
amazing selection of specialty rolls and appetizers
the flavors was creative without trying too much
our favorite bouncer david
the portion was huge we still had some leftover despite splitting it
server turns and walks away to the bar
i ordered a salad and she asked large or small and i asked what they looked like and the price difference  apparently this really agitated her
she put down the potato side dish on our table and she noticed how little potatoes were on the dish so she grabbed one she had on her tray which had more potatoes
jared spent taxpayers money by calling the police
minimal vegetarian options fruit tray garden salad seafood salad pasta salad breakfast potatoes scrambled eggs pancakes and french toast sticks
owner and staff are great
each cocktail has a carefully selected ingredient list and prepared with care
they only have a few meatfree options and less than they did the last time i went there about 4 years ago
the service is awesome so even though the curry is terrible ill definitely be back to try other dishes
couldnt make the chorizo only brown shavings of what tastes slightly resembles the namesake
detractors 1 california roll was warm and had no cucumber
two trays of free chips  salsa came promptly
i probably will not return
it is also very inconsistent sometimes you get the sauce for your cheese wonton or chicken cutlet sometimes you dont
i really liked this place
in fact while we were eating my husband lamented how many good locals were being lost to gentrification and we both said we hoped it never happened to moosehead
also tried the snickers iced coffee which was excellent
simply put i see the reason yt is so successful with 8 restaurants and 32 years in the biz
my favorite part of teaks is the consistency
nobody was disappointed
we went for happy hour with a group of 4 we are old farts so the music was too loud
the pretzel rolls on the mini bratwursts had the best real pretzel flavor i have had in a long time
please please please get a second server
otherwise it would be 5 stars all the way  we will definitely go back
services is prompt friendly and courteous
did i mention that gallo blanco is a great value too
fun little local bar with a pool table as well
if you have to eat hear stay with foods that are freshly prepared like their pastas which were good and prepared for you
first time i came here i saw all of the crew even some of the servers
but i have to admit they are a couple of cool cats
there is plenty of seating around the dining room
also famous for their sicicilian rectangular pizza  their chicken wings  steaks
the squash pure on the scallops was incredible too
cool vibe very clean and an amazing burrito
service was great and might be the best wings that ive ever had
staff is great food is wonderful try the trek or morning ride and you will not regret
this is honestly not an exaggeration as i tend to do that at times
great flavors and spices
note to all their temperatures are a little redder than you may be used to
cant wait to go again
there were plenty of chunks of crab and mushrooms and slices of truffle
love you guysgals and i will plan a near future event which is a little less alcoholic and scattered to where i can hopefully meet more of you in an intimate dining scene and have some one on one time
oh we tried
if you notice most of the five star reviews for this place are speaking to the price rather than the food
he talked to us for a little while and wasnt just friendly but seemed genuinely sincere with making sure we had a good experience
twenty minutes went by and they still had not taken even a drink order though a busser had brought bread
we ate on the patio
things are just bound to go wrong when you have that many people to serve
i have never had a bad meal or experience here
now shake hands
located in a plaza the restaurant is large and as with most ayce places offers more selection on weekends
actually it was 20 minutes when we left
love it so much
5 for a pint of premium and entrees for under 7
i guess typical of most i have been to
i highly recommend this dish and would definitely come back here again one day
i like the fact that there is a wide array of healthy food options at grabbagreen
all very good
its a good atmosphere and enjoyable by yourself or in groups
i tried her meal and it was delicious
our entrees were a stuffed steak what i would refer to as a steak parmigiana and stuffed shrimp with spinach fettuccine
to me an average sushi shop trying to be hip
the second time i came here to have lunch by myself
the bar tender was very attentive
the ambiance is great
tons of murky brown salty sauce on both of those last two
mix of a little of everything
the low ceilings and cigarette smoke dont mix
if you want to smoke a real sheesha this is where you come very authentic
pro tip size down from whatever size you think you need
i love this place
theres hh in the middle of the day mf from 3pm6pm and at night after 10pm not fri and sat so thats a great time to go for great deals on their appetizers and alcohol
during our entire stay there we watched random infomercials and football documentaries
we order 4 or 5 appetizers and make a meal out if it
quick moderately priced meal from order to delivery of food took just 10 minutes
inly thing is they should have free wine or beer
after the waitress and manager himself came out and told us he wouldnt split the bill but would allow swiping as many cards and taking cash to complete our bill
the first time i was invited to yuzu by my love i was blown away by the execution of the food
i cant imagine going back to this place by choice and my last few times here have been because i was meeting friends and this destination was chosen
organic freerange half roasted chicken 44  organic freerange half roasted chicken with bacon mushrooms and creme fraiche demi glace
i inquired if there was a cut off rule of sorts and they advised only if a patron is under the influence and needs to be
their sangria is amazing
they also offer complimentary valet
to me i need to have an acquired taste for this
they tasted artificial and very sweet
delicious great service  nice to find s great sushi place in mesa  everything looked and tasted wonderful
ive heard horror stories of the gory wakes of destruction tequila leaves
but they ran out
the service was mixed depending on the night i went
i really love this place
we didnt even make it far enough to see the wine list
there were people sitting at the bar that were clearly irritated after waiting for ten minutes just to get a drink
when it did finally come out the dishes were delicious
loved it and we will return
then to top it off they took forever to give us our tab
our bill rang in around 200 for two people this place is expensive
we have been there two times and we have had terrific experiences both times
fortunately theres a bar on every corner in vegas
thank you for what you do
this place is sooo cute
a friend who works on rose street met me here for after works drinks recently
i ordered an old fashioned and the smoked half chicken and my husband ordered a beer and the brisket
i had the chocolate torte which was fun and had some great garnishes the pretzel ice cream was surprisingly savory and tasty the popcorn brittle stuff was awesome but the torte itself wasnt that great
we ordered the strawberry balsamic salad 15 to split
clearly a neighborhood haunt a wide variety of clientele were enjoying the evening making for some pleasant people watching
im sure dandelion market has run the numbers and decided that this is the way to go however i would have preferred it if the portions and prices were split in half so i could try a greater variety of things
everything we ordered was excellent
we ordered the nacho appetizers which were big platters and we had one of each type of platter to feed a hungry crew of guys
they have limited selection of food and its definitely not as good as the buffets at the nice hotels
i love pork so i was pretty excited about the sandwich and it was better than i expected
ill start with the space a former bank it has transcended into a fabulous work of art
about 20 minutes after we entered the place someone finally addressed our group
while each of the few bartenders ive maybe had three has always been friendly i definitely agree with some other reviewers concerns that there needs to be a better sense of customer service there
overall my experience here was just ok
second because it is located inside aria the prices are marked up 1 and any sales or promotions this location will likely not participate
they then went the bar with no name which had no tables so they ended up at mugshot
i had the new york rare
if youve ever had sushi in hawaii you know how good it can be and j has found a way to produce the same quality and even betterin az
it taste so good and satisfied my breakfast craving
this is a place to avoid especially for the lgbtq community
san tan brewery was our chosen destination
i stayed here recently and was very disappointed
the restaurant is big and was very crowded as it was spring break time
been going here since before their renovation but wouldnt recommend to a friend who is from out of town
my boyfriend and his brother explain what an ordeal its been
they had great service and the food came out fairly quick
i loved the feel and the staff was very well educated about their menu
a soft pretzel to share and a fiery drunk burger made with beer cheese and fried jalapeos
jimmy and the owners of the other place are rivals and i was told he moved back so close to put them out of busines the food is just as good here as cranberry in a much better space
we will be back
one of the best dishes i have ever had
bedienung sehr aufmerksam dabei aber nicht aufdringlich
we asked for medium and they were way over medium in our regards however i will take taste over preference
my side salad which cost me 5 bucks was a handful of lettuce with no toppings
how is the sushirolls
this venue proves once and for all that its not the sport its how you market it
fried pickles and coconut batter onion rings
love sushisometimes understafflike the live  dj music
reason being so for the amount im paying for a burger i personally like in  out burger better as for the asian side its ok ill go to an asian restrurant
nice young korean men dressed in black p
service was attentive and warm
see for yourself
everything was delicious and the service was fantastic
also love the misters keep everyone cool just in case the nice cold drinks arent enough
i really asked to see if perhaps i could change his demeanor by allowing him to open a line of communication
i had the pleasure of having brunch with three friends this morning and we were more than satisfied with everything we had
ny strip and wasnt impressed
tgexwaiter and the guy who brought the food  were attentive and helpful
went in on a sunday afternoon
some neat hat light fixtures as well
just goes to show a lot of the makebreak of a visit comes down to your server or bartender
so following this quite inconclusive and contradictory review id say give it a go its a hit or a miss with fingers
sides  creamed corn 3 stars while the flavor was good with excellent seasoning and a nice heat the frozen corn used was just mushy and not up to par with the rest of the food
on this visit i was told my wifes drink dark and stormy was served in a collins glass due to the on going theft  of the copper mugs normally used to present the drink and the ginger beer that they made inhouse was very time intensive and that they now use a mix
if youre vegan id stop in
so when this place popped up i knew it would be a good addition to centennial hills
this location is great because it has parking
however it would have been nice if he had communicated that dish would be comped bc the whole time we were thinking how bad the service is since most restaurants would comp it
the wait staff was attentive and the food was great
it makes for a more complete meal
no one knows anything servers asking other servers
i do have to say though the waitress was very nice
be prepared to fend for yourself
the wings were cooked very well the dry rub was just not enough flavor for my likings
its an average place to hangout
we also had a papa relena mashed stuffed and fried potato ball
i dont know if we went on a bad day but there was hardly anyone there and it was hardly worth half the price we paid
also the lobby and hallways reeks of a heavy powdery floral scent carpet cleaner
for all those who love the rolls they have an extensive list to choose from and cooked item too
my friend and i came early and we found the bar filled with an older clientele
my relatives are from france and actually commented that the escargot was just as good maybe even better than anything they had tasted in france
although the bread was sliced which took some of the fun out of cracking open a baguette
do try the g spot this pomegranate and grapefruit based drink aint virgin 1 will do the trick and is only 3 in the afternoons
the chicken yaki tori is also pretty good but maybe not the best pick if you dont enjoy the taste of soy sauce in chicken  otherwise tasty
will never be coming back
also i heard my piano teacher performs here
then he did bring our iced tea  after we asked three times  with no lemon no straws
but towards 11 or so some of the older people start to head home
what makes this hickory awesome is none of the above
also no uni no toro despite it being pictured on an advertisement and no super white or and other fatty fish that could make up for it
sehr schnes anwesen mit super weinen
townhall is also a great place to catch a game or catch up with friends
i told her i would wait for the outdoor spot which  she said would only be a few minutes
their cocktails are great if a little on the sweet side of the spectrum
die markthalle in ludwigsburg ist eine im amerikanischen stil gehaltene billiardbar mit restaurant
i would like to go more often but the noise keeps me away
more than party of 4 are force to pay 18 tips
and the chocolate lava cake at the end
a great place to meet with with friends
we immediately asked for the bill and the two waitresses who came by said we had ordered too much even though we had only put in one order and we didnt order much food at all especially for two people who both eat more than the average person
free wifi great conversation with employees just felt good and will be returning when i am back in town
the food was really good at everywhere we ate at the hotel but honestly everything is so over priced its absolutely ridiculous considering your in vegas
portion size wouldnt fill a panda express two item combo styrofoam box but the price was large enough to buy 4 of them
we order the calamari it was cooked pretty well and came with a spicy buffalo type sauce  not bad
i mean how hard is it to wrap crabstick and avocado in cucumber
so i told the swamp donkey to sock it before i give her a trunky in the tradesmans entrance and have her lick me yarballs
we live in the other side of town so wanted to try something on this side
simply worst management and costumer service i have ever seen in montreal
my husband is also a huge fan of their pork dumplings and i cant resist getting an order of crab rangoons each time we visit
bulgogi quesadilla  wouldnt get again
came across rachels kitchen
the vegetable eggroll is confusing and not the best eggroll ive ever had but still a nice start to the meal
this place is good enough though that i am willing to give it another shot
the menu at this location is identical to the original location and the fried pickles are still some of the best ive had
i ordered the veggie enchiladas for lunch
then we get our food  chorizo with eggs chiliaquiles and menudo
the perfect margarita tasted as if it was made entirely of sweet and sour and the bahama mama tasted chalky and gritty
this was my third time and each visit has been consistent in all aspects of the experience from food quality to service
each table was provided an ipad for order taking makes the menu reading and ordering part much more efficient
the service was awful
how often do you go to a restaurant where the staff shakes your hand and introduces themselves to you
would highly recommend this place
dont get water  it tasted like it came out of a bad water pipe or something which i didnt notice till later i was so thirsty
its still a pig
truly one of my favorite restaurants
they have a decent selection of tap and bottled drinks as well as many shooters and cocktails
pretty empty around 945p with about 3 tables and a couple at the bar
well let me tell you of the experience of bambinos and why i wont be back
mimosas with brunch are just right
8 of us were able to get together and they reserved a great table area for us that wasnt around everyone else so we werent battling for space or sound
nothing wrong with it if thats what youre looking forbut why would anyone look for that
try the miso soup and crab puffs to start
they far exceeded our expectations
this definitely was a good deal as there is quite a variety for the fish  included salmon red tuna unagi bbq eel hamachi and torched sushi
love love love the meatzza pizza
we got here about an hour early and barely got a seat at the bar
the burgers take a while to cook as they are made to order
since the place is essentially a giant warehouse it is great for larger groups however as others mention it might be uncomfortable staying there for a few hours given the ac situation
but honestly any time is good and they make it to order so you know you arent getting 12hr old premade mac n cheese
do remember to get some dessert
the steak was very good and cooked as ordered
when we were ready to pay we had then told her that we did not order the fried calamari
delicious but mad hard to eat
i came in around 9 and just got dessert and a drink
i love the patio as well
our table was readyhardly a long wait at all
jesse is a terrific bartender we are always happy when he is there
food was ready within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted like it was reheated
sushi tastes fresh and flavorful
the soda drinks are served in huge containers which was entertaining when they first arrived
and no they were not service dogs
the clientele was a good mix of families adults and college students
i had their vegetarian curry with brown rice and really liked it
while vt isnt the most unique and fabulous place in charlotte it is good
kind of a cool app for restaurants that dont take reservations but it turns out that in the time it took to get there and park they had given our table away
my server daniel never came to check on us
to sum this place up its your chipotle concept in which you build a rice bowl with toppings
well we shouldve gone to bouchon
we had a really nice dinner there including some cheeseburger sliders for appetizers and a chocolate crepe for dessert but by far the best thing we ordered was the lobster pot pie
with that said we finally found it  eddies place
if your blood pressure is at all elevated stay the heck away from this place
needless to say edward made my wrap for me at no extra charge
we would go again
this place has really gone downhill
since we did not get to the bar until 1030 pm on a tuesday it was quite busy with a very corporate feel
we did not eat here so im not critiquing food
inside the restaurant is beautifully decorated and clean
i will definitely be back with a client or 10 to celebrate closing escrow
the newly opened hot dog bar at college and spadina lets be frank serves up gourmet franks with bold flavours and ingredients
we had to wait another 15mins without utensils
joes serves this sandwich akin to sliders with three small sandwiches on the plate
very very average
we decided to sit outside as it was a nice day
if youre feeling extra gluttonous like i do most days they offer an extra large in 32oz
showed up 5 minutes before 3pm and the doors were already locked
we usually get a rose
only three of us so we sat at the bar instead of waiting for an inside table
milk tea with boba was delicious with just the right amount of ice to keep it cold but not watered down
now with no smoke its bearable
the atmosphere was confusing is it a sports bar or a nightclub
this place appears to have excellent food and options
price is pretty expensive though
this made me want to come back
aaron and ryan were awesome bartenders and i have to give them a shout out for their specialty drinks that were not on the menu
totally bummed because reallythe wings were tasty
came in one a wednesday and no one was there literally no one
we had to ask for our drinks too
next time i think i will go get some gelato for less and a whole lot more
engaging funny full of information about what to do in the area and she made it a special time for us
since there were only two of us the waitress informed us they would not be able to accommodate
i dont want to call it bad because it wasnt horrible but they were small annoyances
after three hours there on a sunday night the total came out to about 240 or about 34 per person not including tip
ambience is noisy but you only live once
lucky me the first to review
it was a nice venue to go where the locals hang out
they have sensors
we did thoroughly enjoy those
but the crunch on these pickles wow
what i got was a wine that tasted like it had just been through a blender
we have been here about 3 times now
if im ever in the chinatown area i wouldnt hesitate to return
the rolls are small and not worth it
i enjoyed it a lot
specifically the casoncelli and garganelli
first of all it took it seemed forever for the food to arrive
i usually try to go during happy hourtuesdays to fully enjoy myself
for drinks i had the teatini followed by the rising plum
we went back to the bellwoods brewery and had an incredible time
sure it was a game night so the place was packed but they were also properly staffed with servers bartenders and id think cooks
i tried it and it shocked me how good it was
i happen to go to temple bar a lot and i must say this place just keeps getting better and better
even putting sriracha on my dlux burger with its creamy blue cheese spread and onion marmalade didnt do it for me
they have a decent selection of beersalmost 1520 on tap
decor 25 parking 1 drinks 15 chatime never really impressed me and so did this one
i ordered the beef sliders which come with cheese pickle and grilled onion
the bartenders and staff are really great though the drinks take forever mainly because they go a little over board with the fruit muddling and the like
this place was great
the menu is locallysourced british gastro pub in style and tastes great
kevin was our server
who knows what she would have done
excellent beerdrink specials on certain nights
god its like crack soaked in heroin sprinkled with nicotine
boston pizza is another example of great marketing with so so food
for those of us who love fried zucchini in my opinion cheesecake factory takes the cake here
in the middle of asking her questions she pulls the bill out of my dads hands and walks off in a huff
even though the restaurant was virtually empty for our late lunch 200pm we struggled several times to get our servers attention
ive had great bartenders there ive had some that definitely make you feel like youre somehow interrupting their day
the sriracha shrimp was good sweet potato fries also good  with bbq bacon ranch nachos not so good
food my overall impression with the quality of the food at morimoto was that the overall concept was excellent the quality was great but there were some misses as much as there were some hits and home runs
nice staff and a great vibe to the store
making the rounds after our conference
we were grateful for the recommendation
id come back for fish fry to see if its worth it
wish they were open every day
ordered a couple of flights and food
the ambience was pleasant as there are two levels for seating and familyfriendly as most downtown brunch places are usually too compact to accommodate
all the ingredients were fresh and it was ready on the spot
we have been here three times and have always left happy
the steak was great however the person who decided to add a pound of salt to the outside for seasoning clearly made a big boo boo
come to find out the dip and meatballs werent even on the menu anymore
we ended up ordering the nachos to share and they were delicious with chipotle chips black beans cheese and lots of other goodness
as a matter of fact even after driving by it for years i still thought it was just a convenience store with maybe 3 stools where you can play video poker
originally i had low expectations going into this place but i left with feeling very satisfied by the food and service
thanks for the great service
one thing i also liked was that our server asked us what our plans were that night
will not be back
food was ok bread was ok not sure if this place is on a gotta go back soon
this restaurant is very pricey for dinner but restaurant dot com offers coupons that help
best sushi ive very had and best deal
on the town
you have a huge selection to choose from and for such a steal
robeks only has bowls which are just smoothie ingredients in a bowl
ive definitely had better burgers
maybe the food is good there but i will never go there for sushi
not only were they bad it was way too loud
had a lateevening dinner on a saturday
however once you roll in its definately upperclass
karaoke brings in a big crowd and bands and jazzyrb events seem to have a following as well
yakibuta650                                 taste like plain charsiu to me
it was decent but i like my burgers to have more veggies on them
at that point we cancelled our remaining dishes and paid the bill  to very significant attitude from the wait staff
we ordered medium rare but came over cooked
everyone that works there is great and we keep coming back even though we live over 5 miles away
come on get past the college humor innuendo
then the finale was the steak our choice was medium which was very juicy and the sauce to dip was so good
cant beat that sauce
verdict 3754 but will round up slightly
the service was friendly and the food was great
if you were on chopped kitchen you would definitely be eliminated right then and there
didnt eat here and never will
all fresh fruits used
lucky for his forgottomakereservations self fez was a reliable brilliant and downright perfect choice for a romantic and memorable meal
i initially came in with a groupon and ended up signing on to a monthly plan because i was so excited
this dicks sucks
this will be my first review with one star
i sat mouth agape with incredulity astounded by his presumptuousness and all i could manage to utter was i dont want that
the nachos were horrible
the other people in my party completed finished their meals before i got a new burger
the cilantro syrup had a hint of the spice but not so much that it killed the dish
we had the tartines the salad and the large order of pierogis
well what more can i say about this place really
at first it was mainly a country and western bar and restaurant
we came in solely for dessert
i ordered the shredded chicken tacos and asked for salsa verde
this is a great place to do that
the wings are good but not great
i asked to speak to the manager who was standing right behind our table and no such luck
she checked at the counter and said that would be fine  no up charge was mentioned
dessert was excellent we had the pumping pudding
the menu is broken into snacks small plates and entrees
ive been to my fair share of places to watch sports
the fried cheese curds are pretty tasty but thats about as good as it gets
the 95 one was so smooth and have the rice taste
there was this one dude shirt unbuttoned and alljust gawking at that poor gogo dancing girl
i never been here before i had only heard of it and figured we could go cause it sounded like a place my sister would like
i asked to speak to a manager and was told none were available and i would be contacted 2 days later and still no manager
he asked us how we found the place and i told him i was a yelper and that i saw mistis review and checkins  we will defiantly go back
loved it
we will definitely come here when there is a sporting event
dj not in an ideal location
the 72 shared ribeye looked like it would make the flintstones car tip over
i had the delicious seared peppered ahi tuna steak with spinach and i think lobster mashed potatoes
i gotta say that based on the pulled pork sandwich i had i wouldnt go back
i was blown away when i realized they had food
i got the salad which was not good and honestly we left hungryand the chicken did not taste good on it
they have lots of different choicesgrilled chicken braised beef spicy shrimp ahi tuna and their special antelope
it doesnt say you get rice and beans or side salad or pub fries
this is the place youve passed by a hundred times
i have come to several shows featuring local bands and then saw the avett brothers who are incendiary and have gotten huge
restaurant is built different then what u expect but it was cool
it offers an excellent menu but if you are going for the allyoucaneat option you have to be aware of the one hour time limit
i mean convenience is key especially while on the hunt for the perfect beer
walking up this place looks pretty cool
a friend of mine who had rented the same room in 2009 felt it was much nicer back then and that they hadnt updated it since
the chicken in this dish was cubed white meat with no seasoning and utterly flavorless
hint  only get the half burrito
first time visiting pittsburgh in love with the city
it was covered in a cloyingly sweet sauce and overly salted sauce
all made from scratch deserts like everything else on the menu
food and service along with very clean restaurent make for a good dining experience
it was quite crispy and came with lots of shredded green onion on top
this place is awesome
not even a hit of a buzz so im not sure what the alcohol content was but it tasted good and sipping it gave me a chance to relax for a few minutes
the affogato was the best
if you dont like this place stick to taco bell
stopped in at 5pm which should be happy hour in most places and it is here but there was only 2 couples in a booth and just us at the bar
we got our drinks the bartender made them pretty strong yum then we proceeded to walk around and enjoy the rest of our fremont adventure
lets talk about food
i tried to take photos but some rolls we ended up finishing it before i thought of taking photos eg
but to each their own
the good things about this place was the pho station
the imitation crab in the rainbow roll was blergh and the shrimp was so dry it was almost crunchy it wasnt tempura
no not at all haha i do appreciate that he didnt try to water down how much he hated something
the limited specialty items were a little disappointing
everything was modern and the staff were polite
not sure where the holdup was
a blast from the past  wings and beer
we go here all the time with great service and great food
lots of wine to select but carry it out
great location and local watering hole for anyone living in the harbourfront area
its worth the wait for the fresh uni and salmon
came here around lunch time and they were pretty busy
i dont think their menu is very unique but their wine list is nice
the salmon was dry no flavor
but on a night with friends definitely a good spot to hang out and have a good selection of hot and cold drinks as well as different desserts and cakes
owner manager bartender
everyone ordered a little bit of everything  eezrainbow roll deliverance roll bento box chinese chicken salad apple berry  brie turkey burger chicken bacon avocado sandwich
this was our first mistake
tofu soup for days
the place looks fancy and trendy inside but the food taste does not match
soho is the way to go
it was home
all i gotta say is craaazzy man
it spins faster than i anticipated
i will definitely be returning
the service was equally matched with the exceptional cuisine
but the lady who was service us so bad
one of those places where the senior citizens flock to because its not spicy
you had to literally shout at your bartenderwaitress and even the person sitting next to you
so i recommend that you go for it
my friend and i waited about 30 minutes for a seat it was a saturday night so i didnt mind
my parents and i ate there once but both mom and i got undercooked gagworthy in my opinion orders
my friends and i had breakfast here two days in a row
waxhaw is such a quaint town with a young and artsy vibe i fell in love with every place i went especially black chicken
service we didnt like our server
hopefully this new all you can eat concept that they are trying now will help keep them in business
friendly attentive staff and food was delicious
first i had to wait in line to put my name on the list no problem i expected that so we went to the bar and had a great time
the tables are reserved but were having trouble contacting the person before you
i dont know if ill give it another shot at this establishment but until then my 1 star rating will remain until i regain a positive experience
i hate giving out one star reviews and its been on my mind to give juans another try
maybe check out menu online first especially for the specials
maybe we get the fish tacos in under an hour
one of my favourite places to go to
my boyfriend and i also started off with calamari flat bread and crab cakes
first off how do you mess up fish tacos
i was able to retrieve it as soon as i realized
we usually sit at the bar and get the heirloom pasta and evo salad
mill st is super packed and loud with about a thousand couples having dates and another thousand groups catching up
attentive accurate and if you get tito or sal funny as well
the burger was a 4 out of 5 on my scale
while it may have the same name it is not the same satori its a shame that i have to find somewhere else now but i am not going to spend another dollar there because of how the new owners have destroyed a once good restaurant
i went to korean cowboy because the name rung a bell from a blogto article thought i would visit while i was in the neighbourhood
burgers quesadillas and the famous mountainous nachos
on corn chips not wheat chips
ny strip was cooked to perfection
the pink meat started to crumble and fall onto the plate when i touched it
it had israeli couscous and pumpkin seeds in it which are different and struck just the right notes to change up an otherwise plain salad into a tasty salad with different dimensions to it
ps call ahead for reservations
i would give this place 5 stars just for the oysters alone everything else makes it deserving of the 3 stars im giving it
i thought the cykoria i sliwki had way too much pickled prune on the plate
attentive service ok atmosphere good location
conversation was still possible  only difficult at times owing to the crowd not obnoxious music
if you want to fit in here grow a beard
so for sure its worth it
she answered all our questions explained the drinks and recommended us a few of them as well
the waiter was polite and looked like he was really busy even though the restaurant was nowhere close to being 30 so i guess they were understaffed
in all i was left a bit wanting for more satisfaction out of my meal
once you factor in the 17000 for one person drinking 2 glasses of house wine it becomes much less appealing
yes one can get confused with the number of options present but if you dont try you will never knowright
she had maybe 6 bites and kept adding saltpepper to it bc it had no taste
the manager told me it was extra
failed on the ahi poke rolls were ok they were out of 3 of the 3 desserts offered on the menu
we looked over the menu and saw they do not accommodate people with gluten or dairy intolerances
well a few pieces of sushi into the meal a beetle comes crawling across my plate
overall i would return to try other dishes but will know to specify less salt
my pot pie had a rosemary gravy that was divine
we will never be back and we will definitely be telling all our friends and family of our horrific experience
i have no desire to go back
its trying to be something different and stylish but it doesnt work
these wings are frozen and slathered in sauce then served
we went to hiroba sushi yesterday because the ratings and pictures were great
the restaurant was relatively empty but i could see it being a great places for drinks and happy hour
would go back
our party of 4 was seated within 20 minutes despite a full dining room
my suggestion is get a dance on the floor first see what the girl is up to and what she says it will cost before going upstairs
the service was really amazing and attentive
the staff is friendly but it often is a long time between visits especially on the patio
and they had some sort of vegas touristy entertainment with people being called up on stage
im going to probably have to give this place another try
super fresh meaty and tender
came here a few times very tired after work and had a good relaxing bonding session with my coworkers over food
this place is good for happy hour but i wouldnt come back for anything else
i had a burger
its next to the mall so we hung out at the mall after
tons of beers on tap and they have a good veggie burger
by that i dont mean exquisite like some french cuisine
the volume is too loud at revolver but is at a much more tolerable level than stoneys
fussfree isakaya in downtown toronto steps away from noisy yonge and bloor intersection
as far as the margaritas
the food was delicious but my eyes were bigger than my stomach
i absolutely love their sandwiches and next time i will hopefully not be on my lunch hour and so able to imbibe one of their many beers
it was my first time here so i was eager to sample some fresh japanese food
alright ive been here plenty and for some reason the thought of writing a review kept escaping me
when he came back with the bill i said is that funny over there
best bar in arizona by far
i love this little local restaurant
im a fan
i also really dislike that a couple times ive been there there was very loud screamo type music playing which was a huge turn off to me
theyre pretty big
two burgers that caught my attention was the truffled burger and the jose andres special burger
we ordered the scallop ceviche which tasted great but was really lacking in the scallop department
she spoiled me and my husband aha  we order the nachos for an app simple but tasty
the employees are all very nice
my seat was right next to the service bar
beer wine and beans
and excellent customer service
its a lot of italy with a family atmosphere and the food is always perfect
we were slightly disappointed that they didnt bring out any celebratory champagne or dessert
i guess it was decent food but the main trend we noticed was that everything was super salty
bathrooms are typical dirty bar bathrooms
a note for those bachelorette parties  eating dinner at the restaurant does not get you into the club automatically so plan accordingly
the restaurants was really clean and the environment was great
the food was really bland
i would say this is probably the second best place ive been next to tea planet but the prices are better here
le service est rapide et les sushis taient trs frais
food was good
when we got there the light shows hadnt started yet
we went back for dinner and was very disappointed
i think it is worth it simply for the experience especially if you have never been in an ice bar before
i snagged a piece of my friends chicken and waffles and was quite disappointed
i ordered the young small size which was plenty for me with wonton and thin noodles with pork
so right off the bat i fell in love with migas service
my meal came with beans and chorizo potatoes  both well seasoned and great tasting
we decided to mention it in passing to the bartender just as a headsup for the kitchen and what did she do
went on yelp and searched for best happy hour in scottsdale and the living room came up
i order it assuming it would be a rice risotto
its bad because you cant communicate very well with these people
personally i had never been to a male strip club no there isnt real nudity here they stay in thongs but the reviews were great and riding the mechanical penis sounded like it was right up our alley
the duck was fatty the french fries had an undiscernable but weird aftertaste the shrimp was greasy i could go on but i stopped trying the food at that point
so not worth it
then sarah mclachlan
the crunchy fresh water crabs were unique  creative  and tasty
that aside we were both happy with our drink choices
overall i have to give this place 355
kind of pricey but thats equivalent to the places i listed above
i had the lamb
several were vegetarians
the environment is casual and we had fun people watching  best part is its right on the capital bike trail
definitely give this salad a try
now the bad
fairly small seating area inside
props to the bartenders they were working extremely hard
this was all after we had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation
angel and jackie are the reason for my four star review  this is a very chill bar in the center of redrock the prices are not the best deals but the pours are more generous than the restaurants and the ladies and gents that work there are as pretty outside as they are on the inside  it had good music playing on a saturday night and i legit screamed when they played my despacito song lol  over all its fun and has people there in my age bracket 30s plus very upscale type lounge with pretty chandeliers
we were given the tour and it was really cool to see
this pizza featured a crust that was at best postcardthin and at worst toilet paperthin
it was so good
good amount of noodles as well
it was just fat
the service from start to finish was impeccable
for the price the salad was just okay
tried the chicken fingers to start my meal
i got the chicken pad thai and loved every second of it
we enjoyed it so much i came back the following week to get gift cards for my moms and aunt for channukah
i will also say that my wife did not love hers
with no apology
the perfect place for a date or just hanging out with friends after catching a movie at the lakeshore 7 a place where you feel as comfortable wearing a polo as you would a suit and tie
hubby and i went on a tuesday night and theres no line
we got there around 815 place was pretty empty
by the time i was 12 way through the huge king crab legs and the rock crab claws i had enough
we finally went to ebbgs new location on east blvd
we waited 25 minutes to be seated which was fine
my favourite of the night
my wife and her friends had a similar experience as mike g she said the waitress were rude and actually argued with her about her order
very happy and satisfied with the service
i just get super annoyed when they are extremely busy with a long wait and dont open up the other side
however it fell into the same trap as the mozzarella plate it sounded so interesting and delicious that our expectations were set too high
funny thing is there was no one at the door when we walked in so we never got our ids checked either the whole night
unfortunately i cant give it zero stars
we need more like this downtown
other than that enjoy
shrimp is really good i always get a steak and thats good too
i have not tried it though so no comment as of yet
there there is a nicelysized bar in the center with a few tables around the walls
the cheese sauce was outstanding the sriracha topping added just a little spice and the meat was really good
ive been about 7 times now and love this place
but i digress
this is the fremont i love
no hassle and the parking deck rocks when its raining
the waitress was friendly enough but id much rather come to danmarinoredonionnewname at 2 am when i dont know any better
so i think this place is pretty accommodating to all
my overall experience here was great
the place was not packed either at that time 4pm
obviously i will not be back nor will any of my friends or clients
id still rather have a franziskaner weisse
food is ok tho they were busy so it took nearly an hour and a half to get it
went to have lunch here with a friend and it was my first time doing ayce dont know what she ordered but it was all good
the sea bass was great too
we shared a 16 oz fresh sugar cane juice 599  pretty good
this has got to be the best ayce sushi place hands down and i cant find one of comparison in cali maybe except sudachi in san franno ayce though
this is the first place ive ever tried one of those large tacky frozen drinks from
like i said above a must stop when getting off at waverly
i like the food but i really cant get over the prices for some of the stuff they serve on there
it was quite genuine
have to admit i was surprised
the fried rice is nothing but brown rice
our two friends each had the cheddar burger and they loved it
my mom and i each had a combination lunch with teriyaki tempura and 4 california rolls
we will be heading back and taking advantage of their 2 scoop tuesday
its not just a meal its an experience
i always get takeout for that when im sick
this is the coup de grace on your appetite
is this the best sushi you will ever eat
personally id rather drive 20 minutes to the phoenix postino locations than spend any time here
if your looking for a place thats updated and date friendly this isnt the place
we just found this to be utterly unacceptable
it is just okay
the wine list offers as many choices to compliment the oyster experiment
ask for half the blue cheese as its superfresh and sweet sweet bacon
sinatra playing loudly on the speakers an appropriate choice no doubt for the theme of the resto
we were told the wait may be about 3040 minutes but it was more like 34 minutes as they were able to accommodate us right away
just my opinion but if they picked a direction and went down it perhaps they could create something outstanding
does this pic look at all appetizing
i will go back and definitely get the crab ragoon again
there is also trivia on tuesday around 7 the seating is spaced out and there is outdoor seating however during the weekends it gets a bit packed so get there early
i had to go back to the register to find the girl that checked me out on her phone and when she was done she looked up at me and i had to ask if my drink was ready or if they needed to make it
then theres the manager aka the only reason im the lead singer in the band is because im the manager
either way a fireplace and lots and lots of bourbon was all i really wanted anyway
the ratio of girls vs guys is good since then wont let guys go in alone pretty much
apparently all the tables were filled to capacity
if you are uptight and bitchy dont come here
why the third star
for less than 20 the two of us can enjoy a nice lunch or light supper they always include a couple of avocado or cucumber rolls with orders over 10 which rounds things out well
the concert i went to see was directly below my hotel
without being too verbose but even the bathroom makes me happy
and it came down to 35 per person
my family who came in from vegas opted for a burger and fry and they said it was cooked to perfection and it came out at the perfect tempature and tasted incredible they want to visit townhall again when they come to cleveland
our waitress was not helpful at all
awful no place to sit crowded and noisy
i felt like i could of spent all day here just relaxing sipping on some yingz and talking to the other friendlies at the bar watching some sports on a handful of tvs in the place
horrible never coming back
town square is such a pleasant place
this restaurant is in an unexpected area of north las vegas
i missed the taste and the color in the glass
closest one to my house was this place so decided to check it out
blackened mahi mahi tacos were so salty i thought someone was playing a joke
after a week i called customer service as my modem still had not been shipped
its in a good location  just down the street from velveteen rabbit in the arts district
unwined also has live music however not on the night of my visit
it was good that time but completely empty
now you all must be thinking im the biggest cheapskate but its just my philosophy i guess since im a photographer i know a ton of good looking women who look millions of times better even without makeup than these broke ass chicks rocking the glitter gulch stage
but i will give this place another try
the gourmet salad bar with over 50 items was incredible
i love this place
we will definitely be back only wish it were closer to home
they also serve four peaks kilt lifter which is my favorite beer
stalestiff hardno taste
thats great service in my opinion
we also ordered the spicy tuna crispy rice which was ok nothing special  the spicy tuna once again like all the other food items lacked flavor
they have a lot of unique offerings from mango crepes durian pudding to egg rolls
100 sure it was the burgers
this place is cheaper than all of the other ayce sushi in town but they dont give you nigiri for that price
i asked at the front desk if they served drinks and they said yes
unfortunately the vietnamese coffee i had was not authentic vietnamese coffee
just got to vegas
mine shouldve had alcohol in it but didnt taste like it
i liked this place
i love the interplay of textures
unless you like hot sushi rice and salt water soups coupled with rude servers
sounded too good to pass up
the onion rings were the same golden brown and crispy
their entrees are definitely prepared in chinese cooking style and rolls taste way different then what you expect
sign states they close at 10 pm
asked for fresh bread sticks and was given semihot bread sticks definitely not fresh
i never have to wait too long for food or drink
despite all this my wife even found a bug in the salad
you can tell a lot about the meal you are about to eat by the quality of the salad
also brandon t was excellent in service and cheerful disposition
mac and cheese is very good
i would have to come again on a nonbusy time
and he brought me one to try
the service always smiling very friendly
i know they are a great looking restaurant and they have good food but you are no better than the people you serve so remember that
despite the chaos they all maintained their composure  got thru the rush
the service in the bar where we sat wasnt too bad though the food just sucked
and then he had the nerve to tell us about how he would only take it off the bill if we were going to leave extremely unhappy and that he was already losing money on the sale as it was
a big kiosk near the escalators at the fashion show green crush is also next to one of those oxygen bars that are still around for some weird reason
no one made complaints on any of the sushi itself
tempura and presentation of food and the service was good though
a lot of pizza places say new york style but ive been to new york and have had plenty of pizza plus im originally from the east coast and new york style pizza is awesome
if ur in vegas def plan a pit stop
i ate the other half for lunch the next day and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt
the service was some of the best ive ever had at a restaurant
the patte we ordered was quite disgusting in my opinion and yes i have had good patte in the past
i asked what the charge was at the bottom and he said it was our drinks
masa definitely promotes a great atmosphere
netter aufmerksamer service
had the pork with gravyyummy
this is an unforgettable place to dine on incredible food
they were extremely successful in avoiding flavor as one of my codiners remarked
when you cant enjoy either it is pretty sad
it felt clean nice and well kept
my husband and i wanted to try something new and bakersfield was a pleasant surprise
my honey bbq was nasty as was the carribean jerk so i asked for more mango habanero  and she brought me out bone in ones ahh
started our first vegas trip off with a bang
when we arrived the hostess asked if we had a reservation
portions were plentiful
we cannot wait to return  morimito is a culinary genius
i like meeting friends here and have a beer
pretty hard to believe but apparently it was my fault after all  i was remiss in not opening the styrofoam container to make sure there was tartar sauce etc on my burger
if you love sushi and want to be taken on a flavour tour without breaking the bank this is the spot
great friendly service good food had the eggs benedict made with potato cakes instead of english muffins
love the idea of fresh fast and healthy
i strongly recommend going
on a holiday weekend in a tourist destination you run out of wine
definitely were treated like secondclass citizens because we had children with us
we had the wings and they were at one time excellent
no complaints  still no complaints even though today they messed up our dessert order   then when we finally got the right one it just wasnt too tasty the manager came by  asked how we are doing  if we are enjoying it i was honest  said no lol
my friends werent too happy with their meals either
my favorite restaurant in charlotte
but there is no reason for me to return to this location in scottsdale
get the big jim it is outstanding
the ruben sandwich was the best ive had    wow
the chips were hot and crunchy the eggs were cooked perfectly
i noticed that they also mark items that are dairyfree and other allergens
there was an automatic gambling machine
i love the sweet potato fries and the after hours
fish  chips  whered this thing come from
the bar is separated from the restaurant by a small wall but both are quaint and cozy
while the beer bread is actually more like a flat bread and doesnt have a strong beer flavor i cannot get enough of it
why didnt we go west we muttered as we slowly passed places we deemed not good enough
la red rickard vaut le dtour
super yummy food and fantastic staff we like mike
margarita was our server and she was attentive and had personality
had a brisket and veggie taco
i went back the next day as soon as they opened and was told they didnt have it
like all my other reviews im not a big fan of sweets
atmosphere this place is slightly rustic a lot of wood and copper
were happy we did
the edamame was low in salt for a change which i cant praise enough
bring your friends and oh yea  you can be loud and talk with your hands all you want no im not an italian but its funny how you just get adopted anyway
the sushi was definitely nothing exciting  it was definitely my least favorite item of the night
i wanted to take hubby outjust because
seriously go try it
tried the sushi sliders meatballs quesadilla fruit loop salad
read the reviews and it sounded like one of those places that i love exploring
i really wanted to be wowed but all of us agreed that the food was just ok   the pasta pork chops and 2 different steak cuts were well priced and of decent quality just nothing any of us would order again
nightly food specials delicious homemade soups
it was indeed great
as for the bartender the first time he made my colorado bulldog perfectly the next two times it was either curdled or bitter and terrible
overall the visit is a splurge for some great coffee and a lovely atmosphere if you really need that pick me up or a place to hang out
it took maybe 20 minutes for all of us to arrive and by that point i think the waiterbartender had swung by once
i definitely recommend the food and am completely in love with that tempura green tea ice cream
my only peeve is the chipsi have never been a fan of potato chips with sandwiches
as previous reviews have stated there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a japanese beer such as fried calamari chicken yakitori edemame and of course pot stickers fried or steamed for 1
19 each i did a double take to make sure my friend had heard the same thing the bartender had just  toxically spewed
no no no
ive been eying the trattoria since it opened and finally got a chance to stop in last weekend
dont forget to ask for some horseradish on the side to mix into the cocktail sauce
for most of the time he stayed at the end of the bar chitchatting with employees and occasionally taking food out
i am afraid to go back because i know there is a 5050 change i will have a good experience
even though you might not like the sound of black pudding i recommend everyone try this at least once
my only regret is that we waited until our last night in vegas to eat here because we would have eaten here every night if wed known how good it was
definitely recommend this
i ordered corn tortillas with the guacamole
beware of ordering from this place
uber eaters beware
the cream cheese was ok and had an unusual texture
food ok based on wings and their other deep fried varieties but i dont think ive tried enough to shy you away from trying the food here
wasnt impressed wanted something light for a late lunch so decided to stop by and give this place a try
not only did it take over 45 minutes to get our food a steak and macaroni and cheese but my macaroni was not just cold but frozen solid since it was inedible they swapped it quickly for a second one in hand that one was even more frozen
we placed a food order and after waiting 10 to 15 minutes the bartender came to inform us they didnt have once of the items we are ordered
for 8 i want at least one refill
solid vietnamese drinkdessert place
asking us what we would like to chose between an apple dish or lemon cake it almost made us feel guilty for not ordering on the other side the food was disgusting
being from seattle i am pretty picky about sushi
got it with goat cheese
have to try the parma roll and the christmas roll
the arizona roll which i thought was by far the best fresh salmon and avocado which i garnished with thinly sliced lemon
i opted instead for a bottle of a1 which was promptly provided
took the inlaws here and they loved it too
we will definitely be back
the plates and silverware were dirty
it was very nice
additional star for despite all this being a fun place to do the great guinness toast although im sure it could have been more fun in another venue
it is a rum bar and it does just that amazingly
only reason it gets three stars is because the food and drinks were good
the line is at least an hour long  usually more because there are like only 15 seats and  they dont take your order ahead of time so even after you sit it takes a while to actually get the food
worth walking 20 minutes or taking a short subway ride
the taste was alright but not the wow kind at this price range i can have alot of choices
the  housemade chips were tasty but a little soggy from the frying oil
she kept our drinks full and checked on us even though she seemed busy
great service great food
we really enjoyed the duck steamed buns although the pork belly could have been a bit more tender and the pig face dumplings
councilman dan  gilman and shadyside coalition need to get rid of this place
this is the perfect late night meal place
service hit or miss
the family and i decided to give them a try this last friday
i have been to numerous nobus across the country and have almost never been disappointed
then for dessert i ordered of course the green tea ice cream which wasnt too frozen
music is too loud sit outside of you can
escargot w bread not from the hh menu  nice but it said it has porcini mushroom truffle oil and all i tasted was garlic in the oil
the beef cheek stands out in my mind because of the balasmic they served with it
needless to say i will be back again as i want to try everything on the menu
everything went great
notice the food was not the first thing i mentioned
it offers bad food overpriced drinks its the middle of nowhere it smells of mule butt and their only entertainment is a subpar one man western band
we needed to get a take out dinner for my daughter who was recovering from surgery and her family
15 mins which is super convenient
urchin n squid was wack
good place for lunch
and two days later i still have maduro all up in my sweater and coat
both times i left disappointed
refined bar food is what one local paper said about lot 17 i agree but ill add delicious to that
seriously cheap food cheap drinks
i have been to the callaway golf center before but i only went in to their shop
their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domestic
it was a little longer for the food college football was on so the place was packed
first impression of this place is very clean and chill
chad the worlds most talented actorwaiterdad always makes us feel wonderful
the cucumber salad is different and with long shredded strands of cucumber and a nice sesame sprinkle a light vinegar dressing
the waiter was helpful and knew the menu and drinks while not being to aggressive
first web site ad aside that shows a young woman sitting with legs and dress askew have no worriesyou will not be offered a lap dance with your cocktails
country music going on one stage old time rock and roll on another and the show not to miss is the fremont street hotties on the far stage next to the nugget
i couldnt stop thinking about it 2 days later
we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu
i had the smoked marlin which i tasted more of the salsa than the marlin  and the sonoran carne asada tacos which were yummy but ive had better elsewhere
the au gratin was very greasy due to being reheated in a ramekin
all rolls were a standard 8 pieces
make this a stop when in cleveland
we knew what it was because we get sushi a lot but still thought it was odd
and my mum loved her steak porter pie full of steak pieces
5 remember the dishes are large
not only was the meal phenomenal but the service is what made it even more amazing
then it is cut in half to eat
the bouncer brings over trust fund babies and puts them right in front of us
this place is always busy but for good reason
the complimentary bread was a bit disappointing  it was way too hard to be chewed and digested properly  we ordered 2 entrees after consulting our server for recommendations  cod brandade this was by far one of the best seafood dishes ever to have gone down my throat
to add to this issue service was really really slow
as you walk in you can smell the fresh aroma of green organic goodness and the cacophonous sound from the vitamix tells you its as raw and homemade as you can get here all prepared with love and good intentions
our server was the absolute best
really just annoyed and disappointed
the few other tables were irritated by the slow service as well i could tell
went with a group for lunch and not wanting to have a friday slump ended up ordering an 11 meatless salad
took about 5 mins to be acknowledged and about 5 more to place our order
i took my parents to gordon biersch for dinner while they were in town
you can get trashed here then grab a bite a few doors down
they have excellent wings good bar food and cheap beer specials on almost every day including half off drafts and appetizers during steelers games
i ended up putting some lemon juice and it was a lot better
my pops got the dang quesadilla which was so good that my mom claimed ownership of it halfway through our meal
if youve been out drinking all night this place is perfect to curb your munchies
i got the yellow curry with bell pepper instead of potato
im not big on mill but they have great drink specials till 11 long islands long beaches adios mfs maybe some others
they pay attention to you right when you walk into the door
there were several food and drink specials as well as a decently lengthy menu
i had the pork shank and it was great
i would recommend that if you plan on coming on a game night or a weekend make a reservation so that youre assured a table
this place came highly recommended from our 1 analyst whos also an astute foodie  service 4550 dylan aka mommy was taking care of us
hubs had fish  chips which looked wonderful but when the fish cooled off the battered coating was like rubber portion good fries good
maybe its because i had such high expectations or maybe its because ive gone to numerous other thai restaurants that delivered a better price to portion ratio but nevertheless for my experience i cant say that its the best but the pad thai was pretty scrumptious
service food and cold beverages are always the best
ive also tried the loco moco bowl which was equally as delicious the tulum tacos best vegan tacos ever and the crab cakes
tavern is a well chosen name
its easy enough to find your muse in the poet or indeed your radiohead boom boom
even after i mentioned to the manager the bartender  the server how disappointed i was last time i was therewith the amount of meat my sandwich still came out with only 1 slice of meathuge disappointment i will not be back
this time was terrible
some of the rolls are loaded with sauce so just ask them for sauce on the side or ask for half roll as is
i knew of blue martini but i had never been there i thought it would be perfect for the bachelorette and the location couldnt be beat
it stops there
my mouth is watering writing this it was devilishly good
we dont live close but will definitely travel back just for this place and their beer is amaze balls too
20 bucks cocktails
awesome place to go for beer mingling a date whatever
before i go on
first off for so many stairs to walk around i understand why there are absolutely no places to sit downrest unless you have table service even when my friends and i managed to find an area to chill or to take off our heels there are guards on your case to wear your shoes and back on the dance floor really
first the bread basket w olives and olive tapenade is sooooo good
we were very disappointed
i had heard good thing about the place from other yelpers and i was excited to enjoy a beer and warm meal
the drink menu is one of the best in town and the bartenders will listen to what you like an d make you a refreshing cocktail that way too
nice restaurant the food quality is quite good and on par with some of the other japanese buffet restaurants out there
i added that i was just frustrated with the situation and agreed to have the potatoes made to go while i ran back out to inhale my food
our waitress upsold our family several times and we were already a group of 12  buying appetizers and a few bottles of wine on top of our entrees
the beer is decent
absolute worst service ive had by far
we shared a bottle of orin swift papillon avable at heinens its amazing my new favorite
nice happy hour items and above average bar service
their home made chips were delicious
i was on the mission to find good dim sum in pittsburgh  found it at jimmy wans in fox chapel
but honestly everything was delicious
laidback atmosphere very friendly staff great selection of local beers and most impressively a full vegan menu
most of the dishes were on the sweet side and didnt have a balance
ive only been to the location at bloor
i will go back because of how well they treated us
they have a tv over the bar showing kpop music videos which i always enjoy
they also have a mexican korean and thai style rolls
tip the valet generously and you still make out well
the smokey russian and monte cristo are my favorites and seem to be pretty popular overall
then my drink had a hair in it  a hair that was clearly not mine
great quality drink selection fantastic ambiance tasty food good service
will never never eat here again
the fries are not crunchy at all which was a little bit of a disappointment
i suggest the avocado egg rolls
the menu was pretty straight forward and the quality of the food was very good as well
the margaritas deserve a second sentence to express just how good they are with many variations in flavour and tequila
i would love to back and eat many many more of them
always full of asu or local working business women
as i arrived the place looked nice and inviting
fresh crisp greens with perfectly grilled red peppers and sliced roma tomato tossed in subtle wine vinegar with very good quality olive oil
has anyone ever seen rolled monkfish
of pork and onionfilled minieggrolls that are fried
the end pieces were much narrower than the middle
on the plus side this place has so many rolls and they do a great job mixing and matching the different fish options and the sauces
walking in everything on the menu sounds amazing and everything was just what we were looking for after a full non stop weekend of drinking and plenty more i ordered the steak and eggs over biscuitsforgot the menu name and my friends meals were all very good as well
i guess they made extra and they were courteous enough to give the rest of it to us
dont get the ronin
had the lavender mule and their old fashioned while we waited for a table
according to my bf love everything on the menu except the pizza
i got off work at 10 and came by here for the first time cause i heard this place was awesome for karaoke
we asked for the beer garden area to get away from the music
i cant speak to the sushi
i have always had a very good impression of jacks as it is my trademark but a slight disappointment settled in still greatly a favorite bar and grill of mine
the food lived up to all my expectations and all the hype
i didnt care for his but the pastrami was really good
the food is overall delicious
breakfast or lunchdinnerthis place is a winner
if you havent been in a while it is time to try it again
everyone who came out later due to the bar area being full was complaining about the heat and the misters would have helped
great location with parking
lettuce wraps  they were out of this item
she did not ask to replace it or discount our bill
it was easily an inch and half thick seared perfectly with plenty of avocado slices to make it the best fish sandwich i have ever had
pleasantly surprised with this placesaturday night with a large group and well taken care of
shot off the second story
i cant get enough
would i ever go back there
best casino and hotel in vegas
during busy days ie friday  and sat can get quite crowded and be quite close to multiple other customers
unfortunately my experience was not the same
we found everything to be underwhelming
all of the sauces are so good
butttttttttttttt i guess its just the atmosphere  or something in the vibe   that im missing
one of our favorite pizzas but the service is pretty bad
we wanted to try out tao because we were with a couple of dudes and knew we could get into the club without paying for a cover for the guys if we ate dinner there
in my mind frequenting all of the west gate bars and restaurant this stands head and shoulders above all the rest
i order a drink to only be told i must choose another one
yum yum yum
theyve got 99cent deep fried twinkies nickle slots and waitresses who bring you free booze
when i placed my order i told the server i was a bit difficult and after taking my order he replied that it wasnt difficult at all
we will definitely be back
the following evening i returned with a coworker after having dinner nearby we caught up on the days events all while enjoying several local craft beers
how can it be less than one dollar more to upgrade
we sat for a long time before even being acknowledged
left very full and satisfied  looking forward to returning
waited for 15mins in line while the whole crew was behind one cashier
i ended up getting the opposite a bacon cheesesteak and the best part of that were the homemade potato chips they served with it
so how does this explain shortage of inventory
first off we sat at one of the high top tables that had the built in beer taps in it
definitely the best find  now our fav sushijapanese place and best of all we live just around the corner luck us
we polished everything off with the bread pudding and a selection of cheeses both of which were quite yummy
the burger was unmemorable
i came here around 530 so that might explain why the vibe was off
they have a vast menus of noodles and other entrees
we hope that he will be here for a long long time because hubby joked that we can come every saturday for lunch now open  7 days a week except for sunday lunch
the creamed spelt is fantastic
4 the girls got free open bar wrist bands til midnight
i love going there when the weather is nice at lunch time when i wanna get away from asu junk food
he would later come back and tell me the bar doesnt have campari
yes   are they trying to sell you shots
when i mentioned the mistake there was a sincere apology everyone makes mistakes and they were brought out after the salad
folks were welldressed and most men wore suits
not too sweet perfectly chocolate
the door on the left remains locked in order to make room for a contemporary floor lamp
i checked the yelp app and boom there u were right down the road
the menu was varied
excellent customer service and topnotch sushi  i recommend no
great service and convenient location within the venetian hotel
he was a bit cold and you kind of got the feeling he didnt want to be there
i always get a pint a beer with whatever im ordering unless its the middle of the day but im here usually at night
i just felt that it was just too pricey for what is delivered
the last two times i have been there the amount of the smoothie part has been much less maybe half the bowl im being nice not sure it was even half where it used to fill most of the bowl
the atmosphere was great and the food was also
my second luv after pizza
they were tiny
i raised mine a bit in return
i didnt try the sushi but the chicken noodle soup was hearty and good
thats a whole other story which ill tell you if you ever at the wright bar
serving was large with two portions of chicken and a ton of onions and peppers
each time i went the bar was pretty packed and rowdy and filled with black and yellow
only downside were their rolls which i knew after inspecting were a death trick when it comes to all you can eat
the free wifi is also happily accepted
ill be giving this place a break for now
we each ordered 2 plates per person of tapas
this place rocks
so we ate what we could
i think there is no other way to say this other then this is the best sushi restaurant nc
the chefs special is a must
heist is surprisingly large compared to how it looks from the street yet all that space is certainly needed given how popular the brewery seems to be
this recent trip i decided to try the house special sweet meat burger wow
and that meant we spent most of the day there nursing a bottle of red
beer is average price
i dived in fork first
for now you should go to beauty bar if want to see a specific actnot because its a great venue
we were able to get up to the bar and order drinks step back and watch tv while waiting for our table
its a place the whole family enjoys going to  so im guessing well continue to keep coming back
my friend ordered the bbq burger which was delicious as well
i liked that there was a pool table in the back but since we arent smokers and the smoke apparently drifts into the bar it kind of eclipsed the charm for us
ive only eaten there once
they explained everything and how they cookprep everything
walking in the door by myself i was immediately comfortable
the place has a great atmosphere and al is the man at the bar
this is now one of my top 3 sushi places
he didnt care to ask why 90 of it was still left on the plate
bathrooms are clean enough but i wouldnt recommend eating off the floors
but the worst part is that not only was the pasta not al dente which it should be it was really overcooked
though unlike other lounges no bottled nonalcoholic drinks to take with you and no flight announcements
loved the choices of dry or wet would love wet lemon pepper  hint hint
most local restaurants in scottsdale have begun to copy it so please when you get a chance
elegant old church
overall  meh
i would pay for people to go to other restaurants in the area
this spot will be my new go to
you need to see my posted picture of the upside down pineapple
the owner will try to bully you into giving him more stars or discredit your review that he doesnt agree with
they were prepared for us immediately
i had stopped by to grab lunch to go and had my son with me
the sushi here was great
the mozzarella sticks werent even warm
awfulthats the only word i have to describe our experience at sushisamba
again this is simply a pattern that is only logical to reach
im not sure anything stood out as amazing but i will say chinese is not my go to food
its like for a moment you forget where you are
save some room or just stuff em down
very accommodating to my substitutions
gotta come by and check this place out
so in sum if youre looking for a good local watering hole where you can catch a drink definitely give tavern in the wall a trybut if all youre in the market for is a great dinner id look elsewhere
they have a decent amount of tvs so this is a great place to watch some football basketball of baseball
instead we were talked down to by security and told they would do nothing unless we pressed charges
first we had the edamame
we tried one of them which is pretty much same or better by 5 10 a dish
excellent sandwich shop
the fullprice appetizer menu was tasty but a little expensive for the amount of food
it also was rather smallish for the price im not a huge eater either
there is  room to seat about 6 people in the shop
was not disappointed by a single
pretty good service with very few exceptions
in addition the people that were sitting  standing with the owner were loud but that appeared to be ok    not sure i will be back  this bar use to be a fun friendly place
she gave us plenty of time to sit and enjoy without feeling rushed
overall definitely worth a visit especially if you are a coffee drinker or if you want to try some hawaiian sweets
im definitely coming back
id love to go back with a smaller group and try it again
the only down side was my group of 9 had to wait for all of us to arrive to be seated
i would highly recommend this restaurant and this location to anyone looking for seafood in the valley
with that sad i also tried the gnocchi the linguine and the rigatoni
the food was average but the wait to get a table or service was not worth the wait
our creme brulees would make their way around our table and we would discuss the merits of each
i was also pleasantly surprised to see vegan options while i am not a vegan your girl does like eating vegan at times
rok shrimp  little nuggets of shrimp friend in a light tempura batter then tossed in a spicy cream sauce
i will say the vegan chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting was delicious
my husband and i have been here twice each time celebrating a special occasion
i ordered the mixed greens salad and beef tenderloin
the best thing i liked to eat there was the wonton noodle soup and their kona coffee ice cream
first class guy who delivered on his promises for the pool party we booked for my brothers bachelor party at daylight
they need new management and new staff to survive
we were not the only table with the issue
absolutely my favorite sushi place in az
the staff was unbelievable i would come back just to be entertained by them
i know i would like to forget paying 100 to hear hotel california
fruit bowls are great this is the only spot i know of that has this sort of set up they hollow out a pineapple for example and put the tobacco in there wrap it up and place coals on top the juices actually infuse creating a great amount of flavor  price is 1200 extra so for two people to smoke after 7pm is 1500 each limit one hookah per two people so for two people smoking and a pineapple bowl your at 4200 a bit on the pricey side especially since you cant change the flavor in the fruit bowl plus dont think youd want to as the tobacco is infused w pineapple juice service however subpar upon checking out they dont tell you that the gratuity is already included on the bill so when youre giving them payment be careful not to include an additional tip especially with poor service like we just had tonight  i know most high end places charge an automatic amount for gratuity but this isnt a high end spot
a sports bar
but its so friggin expensive for what you get
honestly when my friend wanted to drag me here i was not down
we ate light so that we could try some desserts i tried the ricotta doughnuts which were excellent
this burger sounds spicy but isnt at all
i would definitely go again  just on a different night
then we ordered guacamole and it looked really goodexcept there was a live fly in it
of the mains we got my two favourite were the chaufa and the chori papa
thanks el segundo
wish this place would hand out reduced cover for ladies like every other place
overall im happy to have found this spot and will stop by whenever im in the area and in need of good pho
the ceiling is high and the door opens from the street to the dining area
i then waited for 15 more minutes
my mom and i are in town for my grad school graduation and after landing we were haaangry hungry with some sass after a day of travels from chicago
we even moved to a booth in a room away from the bar to try to avoid it
as i stood at the bar wondering if the bartender and i were mortal enemies and i just didnt remember the slight that sent our relationship swirling out of control i couldnt help but notice how awful this place was
my mom had a singapore sling and a boston sour
i mean ive had good service in other restaurants but she seemed to really enjoy what she was doing and so her service to us was really exceptional
but anymore of the dense soup inside the pie i probably would have gotten tired of it
the waitress combined our orders to give us the best deal when we didnt even see that as an option
love coming here
i wanted to wait to review caseys until i actually sat down and ate a meal there
paella would be better if the rice wasnt so stuck to the bottom that its difficult to eat
favorite sushi in the valley
service was adequate place is loud fairly clean very busy
that is perfect
the peach sangria was awesome
the place had such a great vibe with really cool art on the walls
it seems that when you head way up north on the yonge line you can afford a touch of class
inside the theater smelled of food instead of popcorn which i had to get used to
we ordered the beef and shrimp fajita for two
please bring back the grilled veggie sandwich
i believe and did a great job with recommendations for the beer fans at my table
i like the tyber old school
service was horrible
food is good but nothing special either

each time has been awesome
how can you not have a great time in a place with dark lighting and colored lights and fun tropical drinks
i could bathe in that sweet syrupy delight of what most americans will never know unless they go abroad to italy and do a tasting or they happen to work in the restaurant industry
its just to overpowering
pomegranate margaritas and carne asada all day
i got the sweet chili chicken wrap my fianc got the ruben my sister the grilled cheese and my dad the jalapeo burgernone of us were disappointed
the beautiful carin and i met the adorable christina p for a wine tasting event at bacchus a couple of weeks ago and we had a wonderful evening out i know i just wrote a couple of weeks agoim late in getting this writtenin my defense and as anyone who has read any of my reviews will tell you writing these reviews isnt my day job christina had tickets for a pinot tasting event at bacchus and neither carin nor i had been in there before walked by enough times i dont know why we didnt stop in
it was so bad
hey i felt somewhat healthy while drinking it
wish it wouldve been much more lively
the chicken nachos were fine
long waits on more than once occasion
dinner graffiti burger a tasty delicious burger
im so disgusted
chocolate and strawberry and not too filling at all
jade aussi trs bon
food took forever to be served not the greatest food either and the drinks where tiny and super expensive
came here for the late night happy hour last monday which is from 9 pm to close and no surprise it wasnt very crowded at all
it is actually easier to check out their backsides in the cute brown shorts if your feeling really pervy
my husband and i both ordered cheeseburgers fries and a draft beer
verdict  holsteins presents itself as a hip modern burgerdiner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel
tucked away in the revamped quail corners this is a hidden gem with a deserving reputation
it was not great and i love seabass
i am usually at steak n shake about once a month  and this time i probably should have skipped my visit
everyone dining with us absolutely loved it
and that is exactly what their new tacos remind me of
let me tell you it was absolutely amazingly delicious
i ordered a belgian waffle which was good
i honestly dont get the negative reviews my girlfriends and i had a great dining experience
my husband and i are a little picky about service so that is a compliment indeed
so many times you get a tasting menu at a fancy schmancy restaurant and you end up feeling like you are tasting concepts rather than good flavorful food
but to get just two items with a plate meal was disappointing there should have been some type of bread may it have been hush puppies or something
lots of windows light white furniture accidents with cementish table tops
however there are no signs on the wall that says no camouflage shirts
its located in a prime spot on fremont
the servers seemed a little overwhelmed
the sushi is always good tightly rolled and visually appealing while the gyoza is hot and seared just right
the new sls is a great place to check out
im afraid to try anything else
the workers werent working and the store was a mess
weve placed our order and we watch as people around us get their sushi as well as people who come in for takeout get theirs
finally im thinking the waiter will look at me
i will becoming back for sure
not greasy at all
so while the list of burgers appears long they are all more or less the same
why you would ever come to the restaurant is beyond memaybe people just want to sit on the same seats where celebrity asses have been
the penang is very creamy and rich
its a cute bar been there twice before with no issues
enjoyed the sushi platter
what gives the lizard its fifth star is that although technically a chain its a local establishment with its heart rooted in cleveland thats simply outgrown four walls and one roof
very good i even ate the avocado
if this place renovated trained their staff efficiently the employees actually worked for the money invested into better lighting and entertainment then i would consider returning
i mean its just such a fantastic spot for photos
definitely the best vanilla ice cream that ive ever had
they dont skimp on the good ingredients which helps justify the price which is a bit higher than the norm in the area
i got one sprout
also if you go here before a cavs game there is a free shuttle to the q and they give you a token thats good for a 1 draft at townhall after the game
the service was good
i had the kobe meatball with ricatta and that thing was the size of a baseball
we were seated by the windows in the converted sunroom which was nice
super endroit trs trs bien dcor avec beaucoup de cachet dans une ambiance japonaise underground
she walked us to the bar and there was one chair at the bar and at the far end of the bar a high top table that we were offered to wait at
the community and neighbors want this to succeed
excellent new find in las vegas
our sever elizabeth was awesome as well
the pretzel here is really good though  i like both the mustard and cheese they serve it with for dipping
will not even attempt to come in again
for a table while 3 or 4 empty ones have the reserved sign when you are hungry is like a culinary harakiri
sorry todd i so wanted to love your new place but it stayed with me for way to long
seine kellner zu einem mathematikkurs anmeldet
well lets qualify the food statementi had the mac and cheese with pork belly which sounded phenomenal on paper but in actuality was a bit disappointing
we told the housekeeper on our floor we were leaving and she had all day to clean no rush
i am impressed
went in expecting pub grub was not what we expected
on a good night its edible
whenever there was a problem she handled it perfectly
its pretty laid back and most people are smartly dressed
they had two chefs working at the same time
prices are reasonable too
we picked up  some carls jr and hit the road
theres nothing more annoying than waiting 15 minutes for your drink to arrive but that has never happened to me here
and whats not to love about the place  the dark woodpaneled interior the servers in crisp white shirts the interesting posters on the wall ad infinitum
letzteres ist ja neuerdings in gnstigeren locations blich
the quality of the fish was ok but not great
as a side note jonathan the manager truly took my dinner to another level
this bar  grill was down the street from my hotel and i stopped in at a very slow time of day
we were very impressed with the service and how they fixed everything right away
i had one major gripe with the place a little out of the restaurants control was the overzealous attitude of their loss prevention department
it just doesnt make sense to me if you come here for anything besides the trio for your dollar
boursin burger  the boursin cheese was awesome and the burger was pretty good but it was a little dry for my flavor
bartenders are the best
this is my go to place whenever im craving for thai food or just something spicy
unfortunately pts gold dumped my favorite bartenderfriend rudely and without cause
it was slow when i came in on a sunday evening
the fries were cooked to perfection and lightly salted
they decided to take us here bc it was good
she took forever to bring even our waters out
pastrami and i love pork belly together at least for my pallet not so sure
you were able to order half rolls allowing you to have more of a variety
the food was good but not sure if they are worth the price tags
the night was fine again until it was time for lacey p to remove the rest of our plates
the bar was filled to the brim with guests
if you like that sort of thing and good food you will like this place
i wasnt too hungry so i can only comment on the shaved kale salad and the grilled street corn side which i had as my entre
my dad wants to eat here for his birthday so i called to make a reservation for 10 people and the hostess told me that she cannot make the reservation because with a large party a manager needs to make it
with just 2 beers and 2 sandwiches ordered fries were free sides i was surprised the bill was over 30
baked lobster  must have
klar kann man nicht erwarten dass die speisen so aussehen als htte man sie  la carte bestellt
nope same rerun of a pirates game on every screen
what makes this place meh is the service each time i have been here it hasnt been good not necessarily rude but not friendly either
in kansas city a perfect example would be kc masterpiece grill a suburban bbq restaurant versus arthur bryants an urban bbq joint
my sashimi plate was fresh and very artfully arranged
we walked by an empty host booth and then walked into the main bar area
little things such as the citrus infused asian orange salad dressing and overall presentation of boats are simply stunning and captivating
ambient lighting and music throughout the restaurant
we got to our hotel and ordered from bankers
so theres no filter theres no courtesy
mermaids casino is also one of the few places in las vegas that still spits out coins in their slot machines
i ended up ordering the slow boat to china
my burger came 5 mins or so after my friends it was a pretty quiet night
if i did not try the apple one first this one would have been a top contender
this is an old house dating back to the 1800s which has been either beautifully restored or maintained
one of the better japanese restaurants i have been to
you can also get a smoothie or iced tea
i got the scallop special servered over an eggplant puree
i had the linguine with meat sauce which had plenty of seasoned ground beef fresh carrots onions and celery with an order of meatballs on the side
some of the best sushi i have ever had
we just about gave up trying to find it but if you circle the building past the hamricks and the beauty supply store youll find it
not so much the one on one place to have a date with the mrs or a first encounter
the eggrolls were more like chicken pepper taquitos
this place is well worth the drive for some amazing tacos
we had also tried the asian nacho edamame and gyoza
cote du boeuf and tagliatelle
this restaurant is excellent
the staff is also friendly and helpful
so basically i paid almost 40 for a lonely rack of ribs on a plate
we spent over 40 for a shitty meal with shitty service to boot
not everyone is a 10 and some of you need to shave down there
my brother had the game and tame burger which came with perfect herbed frites
this place was awesome
had a great experience dining here on a recent visit to my hometown
we left satisfied and happy
a couple of colleagues and i organized a community event in maggianos
pumpkin pie pumpkin mousse gingersnap cookie and pecan pie vanilla bean mousse whipped cream honeyglazed pecans  300 each
i cant really hold this against them as real estate is tight in plaza but thats really my only qualm
i did find the selection of grilled squash to be a bit sad especially given the caliber of the overall dish
i must say that although this place was very crowded we had a great time
by far the best all you can eat sushi i missed it when we moved to texas for a couple years
the chlorine was diluted with sweat
prices were not bad
no doubt this is a great place to hang out
however some of the rolls kept falling apart
wait times can get pretty high but one nice perk is that their seating cue pagers allow you to go hang out on the square and not in the doorway
only if they lived or worked in the area and needed an okay place to go
shell whisk you away to a blissfully fuzzy place you can call home
i think mercbar would even go so far as to say its a classy lounge
their different flavors on wings are on point
that said if you like hawaiian comfort food you have to come here
highly recommend the italian pizza
i got the santos sangria which honestly didnt like it that much it had an aftertaste i didnt really love
came with a full stalk of celery a wedge of lime and lemon and two olives
we bought the online early bird tickets which really ended up being a great deal
many different food options
we waited another 45min to be just as unhappy as before
occasional spilling of drinks due to dancing frenzies
i thought it was a bit smallcramped and lacked an outdoor area
another conversation with me and the other bartender began and went along these lines should bruschetta take 40 mins
for takeout we ordered 4 of their lunch specials salmon teriyaki steak teriyaki soho loco and tonkatsu each lunch special was under 9
su vino also has a section where you can get all hands on and bottle the wine
been there xmas eve and it was much needed
i had never been to firefly until last night i used to go to sedona for the type of experience firefly offers since they used to have a fantastic happy hour with awesome cheap appetizers and drinks
to be fair they had a great selection of martinis and a trendy atmosphere
we were seated immediately and had coffee in hand within 3 minutes
wir kommen gerne wieder hier wars gut
we will definitely be back
brunch happy hour or dinner is always delicious
my husband enjoyed joking around with her
in addition you realize that it is hard to socialize around pits that big and even more awkward to try to eat when leaning back in an adirondack chair
be prepared to flex  i do have to agree with the other reviews in that i wish they had friendlier customer service
you will start the night well with these
we had the elote with el pastor added and the best elote ive ever had
the burger was cook perfectly the bread perfect
there are a wide variety of items to taste and explore
order the 18 hour cooked pork belly  the vodka shrimp penneyou wont be disappointed
sadly all of this was far from the truth
i love how the sweet chocolate meshed with the sourness of the calamansi juice
from 5a to about 11a it was nonstop
what the hell a cheese omelet with the cheese on the outside
the manager stopped by our table and greeted us and made sure dinner was to our liking
the ambiance is warmand feel like im walking into a cafe in tuscany
avoid and then avoid some more
food 10 out of 10 free parking voucher
the menu was like what youd see at a holeinthewall bar but with much more upscale and dare i say creative ingredients
no special seasonings or expert cooking or fine meat
so there you go
but reallythe guys were full by the end of the meal leaving me the dessert
flatbread is also yummy
ive been to several cigar lounges throughout las vegas and this one is my favorite
i stopped eating it for fear of swallowing more bones and did not finish my meal
they and the bartenders who made them were excellent
good beer not too expensive relatively douchefree
but the one thing not to miss is their cream soda cocktail
getting a 4 on the spice level should be comfortable enough for everyone
the food is great
burritos bigger than your head
the chimichuri sauce is off the charts good i had to go get more
server was a bit rough on the edges she was just tossing the coster on the table which is so unprofessional for my taste
he was not impressed by the menu  had a few choice words after we left he was not happy with his food
i take it back to my friend and she stirs the whipped cream in her drink but it still taste awful
the sausage was incredible not too gamy but it was obvious that it was rattlesnake
this is the same floor as holsteins
a good place for a steak dinner if youre in the area
everything ive tasted here has been delicious so theres really nothing on the menu you could go wrong with
our room was nice but wasnt 100 clean when we got inside
ended up ordering a strawberry margarita pitcher which was delicious
the tacos were also flavourless and the beef or grilled vegetable filling was served on cold thick flour tortillas
my wife is a big fan of beef chow fun and enjoyed it
but otherwise its definitely worth a visit
was blown away by the rude bartender on a saturday night
and they have ravioli
i had also eaten at their cave creek location when it was the more formal dining location now osborn is
boy do i wish this fantastic hh spot was a bit closer to home maybe i dont for my bellys sake
the cesar salad is garbage
oh yeah and pool is 6game
spring rolls were chockfull of filler
i was hungry so when she described it i was a little worried
that alone makes it an awesome place to play
teriyaki chicken and steamed broccoli is my favorite
terrific view of the fountains a little on the loud side great service romantic environment and just a classy restaurant
and said that our order would take about 20 min
wish their tempting pub style menu was delivering on food expectation sad tasting burgers not worthy of good basket of fries
is feng the best japanese food in pittsburgh
driving it felt like we had left az and were in the mountains or at the beach
i was in vegas last week with my favorite sushi buddy so i turned to my handydandy yelp app to find the best sushi in town
change the bartender change the clientele
luckily our waitress was amazing nice blonde girl whos name i forget but she took care of us  was super nice and when she learned about the cranky hostess she basically said fuq her without so much saying those words
we were a group of 15 the manager turned us down three times
overall i will return in the future and definitely recommend the kimchi fries and padak chicken wings
in the meantime my meal was getting cold
people must go here because theyre tired of walking and just want to eat
go back when i go to vegas
if you thinking about going in go late night so you can meet will
this was divine
i have never had sea urchin pasta before and it was delicious
not sure what time
the bread was nice but not great
im from cali but whenever i roll out to vegas im blessed with connections to higher places so im usually a shooin with no wait or cover
we had supper this evening at the local public eatery
will come back
the standouts were the 1st course octopus and 2nd tuna tartar
also my waitress was kinda weird i think she just wanted me to get out of there asapnot welcoming at all
best i ever had
this was after the steve aokii set at marquee theatre sometime close to 1am
gave this place 3 chances
newest tsc location near me
at least bww had something going on
they were from frozen and not cooked all the way through
ive only been to this place once but it left a great impression on me
and thats cool because az88 has always been one of the very few enduring staples for adventurous scottsdale nightlifers
it wasnt busy but there was a steady flow of diners entering and leaving
worse when i explained to him that we have been loyal and longstanding customers at this location 8 years ever since they reopened he then began arguing that this dave and busters had never replaced a jillians and had always been there
we tried to explain the situation but the manager wont budge so we decided to pay what was left but was dissatisfied with the service
i had to send my ribs back to the kitchen because of the low temperature but they took care of it quickly
moving back to the midwest and this was my favorite stomping ground especially during hh
we received a gift card
and if its a special guest itll cost 100
overall 45
then they gave me a croissant instead of a danish so i brought it back to that cash
the bouncers here like to show that they have power and will go to every extent to excercise it
dont recommend this place at all
i had read reviews before we got there
its a place where you can bring the family and not feel embarrassed by the servers or your fellow customers
overall we had a very positive experience marlin really cares the ingredients were top quality the menu was simple yet inventive and accessible and the atmosphere is fun
i had freak n raspberry made in peoria and a belgian blonde by state 48 thoroughly enjoyed both and the after effects
specialty cocktails are good
not bad looking spot for junction
the staff has no uniforms which is cool
cookie dough is classic and yummy
thats why one star dropped
my wife and i have come here twice because of gift cards
a perfect salad
the music was a swanky eclectic mix and played at just the right volume for conversation
i always forget about this place when im in shadyside which is sad because i usually avoid shadyside for food as i think most of their options are too pricey majority of the time
she says i ordered the dover sole when i asked what it came with our waiter stated that he thought it comes with sautes spinach
in the end she removed the entree and applied the 15 discount which is fine
i ordered just water and she got diet
the great thing about this place its next door to our host hotel when we have to work all weekend
what a find
the couple on the table next to us seemed to be having a similiar experince
however i found most of their beer they brewed lacks character and personally i am not a fan
great new addition to the area
thirdly the sushi
tass also has a nice selection of affordable whiskies and serves a reasonably priced bistro menu until 9pm
i was sorry we had to leave to make our reservations at the next place
it could be really cool but just doesnt cut it in 2014
extremely diverse menu with something for everyone
i think it is excellent value ive paid more at other places and gotten far less
we dont normally eat at acye sushi bars
there are quite a lot of sushi places from yonge and sheppard to finch i normally go to the one on spring garden but decided to venture here as it was close to where my friends live
on one visit our out of town friends received the worst bloody marys of their lives
so we waited in the dinning area and ordered appetizers
there were 3 waiters working feverishly to serve all the tables
i had the crab cakes to starts the lamb for my main and the raspberry creme brulee to end it off
well i went
this is easily one of our favorite restaurants of its kind now
next time in town  will definitely stop by
when i arrived the food was sitting on top of a shelf near the cash registers and it was cold
the biscotti was also the perfect match with its muted sweet flavour and crunch
my bf ordered the grilled cheese and wasnt too thrilled about it
it doesnt hurt to have a stellar wine list and all sorts of wonderful accompaniments as well
but the food was good
nice large bar that is lined with old barn wood
but the plus side is that one roll would have been more than enough to fill me up and it was delicious
just close this place down already
they do music mostly folk
after finally getting our food we were a little disappointed in the quality
i swear they perfected the big mac sauce
they had white tuna which i love
if i left the owners can bet others do to
ask for her
go early go often
so despite my regretting my choice of rolls and my brother pointing out damn mike everyone got good rolls except you ichiban is a good choice for a casual economic sushiventure
it already has loads of good flavors in it
vida vida your potential is there but your staff lacks basic restaurant skills
with that being said the inside was decorated beautifully unique
ok thats a little harsh but seriously im not a fussy spice maven or anything and corbins fare is just across the board missing  something
found the place on yelp looking for a small pub
french fries were cold shrimps seemed small
i have to say their flat bread pizza was just ok nothing special but its the cheapest thing on the menu and definitely filling
my sister and i came here for lunch and the sushi was pretty good
on the upside of that we were celebrating a birthday and they gave us the most delicious ice cream cake
we had to call her over and remind her
ordered the andes sandwich tuna steak on brioche was super tasty only issue was the excessive amount of chipotle mayo smeared all over the bun oozing all over the plategenerous portions of avocado and a big green salad to balance things out
so im taking off one star for the snacks which were really really really average
our drinks was full and our need was satisfied
basically on all categories of a grocery store cafe this place scores consistently at the top
like who is sara s my name is no where near similar to that of sara s   that shows how much care nancy c has for this business when she cant even edit out the name she used in her last email with the name of the person who theyre actually referring to
as a veteran of alice fazoolis it was sad to see it go away but im thrilled that scaddabush is trying to do something unique and country savvy chic
i had been wanting to get to arrogant butcher for a while and finally ended up here on saturday night
all 5 of us enjoyed our food immensely and were talking about when we could get together to go back
its a large space and serves as a great sports bar
cool  friendly  knowledgeable staff
the waitress was a super excited person about the bar
definitely will be back again
will not be coming back
i suspect being so far west doesnt help matters
needless to say i was still billed for the fries with no apology for the wait
but im beginning to not trust any yelp reviews for vegas spots
tanktops basketball shorts wutang tshirts  name the douchey clothing item and some guy there was wearing it
they have a big screen tv on the sports book area but tons of tvs all around the facility
a must go
think of it as you favorite wine bar except you switch the wine out for vodka and the italian food for polish
i have to admit i was mildly disappointed in our experience at julian serrano
two dixie cups standing about three inches tall of room temperature tap water
we waited awhile for drinks before another bartender realized that they were sitting at the service counter
other staff seemed to be on top of things but she wasnt
i found it to be a mixed bag
we had the risotto with short ribs which was sorta the oddity on the menu one of these kids is doing his own thing
so sad cause it could be a cool place
started off with fried cheese curds that were awesome
i also really really enjoyed the lemon curd and strawberry jam that came with our baked goods
the place was nearly dead there were a few people at the bar
sweet but not too sweet
it blends too much and can easily be passed over
5 red wine
weird because the dishes were unusually large and heavy for tapas
i liked their chicken tendersboneless buffalo wings
what a treat it was to find this gem on our drive through the area
we started off with a pear of aces grey goose la poire amaretto st germain and fresh lime juice which were very good but decided to try 2 more on the second round
when comparing this guu to the other locations this was our most relaxed experience so far
nous avons tous reu nos boissons et sandwichs en un rien de temps
i definitely recommend
if you get one thing from here you must get the spicy tuna salad
if i recall correctly it was about 1015pasty
my first and last time to this place
my wife and two friends recently dined heremy wife relates the tale ive been here before and everything was finebut that night my wife had the chickenmilanese she thinks it was all but uneatable my wife called the server overwell youve eaten half of it the server saidmy wife replied are you seeing that half you said i ate is spit out on the plate
but 34 of the time theyre rare tell them to make it welldone
i was super disappointed
housed on the street level floor of the luhrs building with a long architectural history dating back to the 1800s bitter  twisted still seems to continue that beaux arts theme in its decor i love the big long drapes and the thick comfy couches the tall ceiling and dim lighting keep the theme alive
i was a bit skeptical until i tasted it
let me tell you where they went
the service atmosphere and prices were all good but not outstanding
there is a reason why it is always full even it is so expensive
paid 60 a person and then they tacked on a 20 tip
i highly recommend it as a solid brunch spot
they both ended up out front and as i was walking outside the manager was not handling the situation in any calm way he seemed to almost instigate a fight
my sudden clarity  ha
no big deal  i wanted some teppanyaki
however the service was really good and the decor was really top notch
in any case my recent visit to kelseys proved that people or places can in fact change for the better over time
id appreciate the lively atmosphere thats just modern enough to be cool but still masculine and clubby enough to remind me of my favorite steakhouse and the service that makes me feel like a king
and knowi dont know her just felt bad for how hard she was working but not able to keep up with the service needs
the place is run and staffed entirely by japanese people as far as i could tell and they always greet you with a friendly hello
their new years eve party was really classy and fun unlike any of the usual clubs downtown
entrees i had 3 tacos from the happy hour menu
without making a big deal of the situation my husband voiced his opinion about the salad to the manager
so it was a bit unnerving
we stopped in for dessert at the bar area and got the lava cake with a couple of drinks
sapporo always delivers in the clutch
this was our first time visiting this new restaurant
i would try va bene again but would request not to be seated in sergios section
didnt venture inside was too nice outside
recently they did make some updates to the decor and menu which seems a little smaller
its a really great chicken caesar it has so much flavor and the grilled chicken is plentiful and moist
since those who were attending were getting into town early this time worked
i will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce
dj was a craftsman with his mixes
they sure are busy on friday nights
make sure you visit this place if you are out of town
the fries with barbecue seasoning were also addicting and i nearly polished them all off and would have had we not had a buffet brunch that morning
the atmosphere and vibe is perfect
place was not too packed
the quality and imagination of dishes is comparable to the best sushi places on the strip
we had a blast at top golf
grab a bite take a shot of irish courage and mix it up with a stranger
i didnt want to tell her how skeptical i was but im happy she didnt change her mind last minute because the mango sauce was great
and i tried one of the many indian imported beers
its a very popular place
i came here yesterday during a working lunch
i think its japanese owned which is rare nowadays for a sushi restaurant unless ive been fooled and its korean or chinese owned but the sushi chef spoke japanese as did the servers
i atmosphere is casual  doesnt feel uptight
they also have a special where you get wings which each beverage you purchase not sure the specific on amount of wings or type of drink  see their website for details
service excellent just the right attention from dlynn no rush or waiting
i love the german cuisine
im not sushi expert but i know whats tasty
we did not even finish our beers
the fries are tasty and never oily and the turkey burger is so delicious
amazingly the disappoint came in the shape of the supposedly ranked 2 burger in canada which was a massive miss
the crowd dj drinks was everything i need it to be
we are already planning our next trip back and taking some friends
my sister loves that they have some mango roll options
that makes it a bit like 5050 for a business but not exactly like most bowling alleys
i said let me see and we turned a slight corner and there were two tops at the bar i just couldnt see them until i walked around
just know what the place is
ayce price went up but still not too bad
im not sure what has happened but with our favorites gone there is little reason to return
i look forward to my next visit  thanks wexford ale house
the manager told me he didnt have a copy and that he didnt have time to print me one at that time
just because you have 20 taps doesnt mean you need 10 of them to be bud products
les scones sont srement les meilleurs au monde
home of the 2 dosequis that is since this is the closest to my house and ive been to the others i like coming here when i feel like an after work beer and an afternoon breeze
worth every penny
its always been wonderful
often the wife and i will walk over there for a burger fries and a tasty microbrew
first time there and it was good
this place is not as good as the one at gold coast
i stopped by for lunch after a meeting today and took a look around before i ordered
so i took one for the team kept my plate and ate about 2 bites as i instantly lost my appetite even though i was ravenous
my waitress shay was very friendly and informative
it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge that we were there and another 15 minutes for drinks
the second visit i had the seared ahi tuna again smoked wings very good as well very tender coconut shrimp eh im not big into fried things i could do without nothing special
the view from here is ridonkulous
i was delighted to see this on the menu because im a huge fan
good for big groups
i highly recommend
then they came back with a plate of three long slices of parm on a plate  not what we wanted and not enough to share
there must be some drama for your mama behind the scenes at sidebar
the tumblers were also crusty again not entirely clean
i enjoyed the smoked cheese and dessert although didnt take any lasting memories from either
you dont want our business because she have 10 kids
my husband had the filet alla griglia 3499 a centercut filet with italian roasted potatoes and asparagus topped witha rich borolo demiglace
we ordered 2 of every hh taco and they were soooo good
an easy order for most kitchens but not here
it was good
of particular note were the catfish bites and sandwich the lobster fries and huge peelyourown shrimp
the food came out super fast which was nice because we were hungry
marinated and grilled very well
loved the cucumber cooler juice and the bbq unchicken and lentil quesadilla
every dish highlighted the beautiful flavors of the garden
dont ruin it for others people
overall a very good experience and we will return
plenty of other clubs with much nicer staff
dont take my  the spectators or jbs word for it
service was great and the decor was also really nice
bring that talk elsewhere
the rose drink the pink lady was actually the best drink ive ever had
we arrived and the person at the escalator showed us the way to the restaurant
i came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday
get the cheesecake to go so you still get it but have the time to digest dinner before hand
the only issue i have is why drop a check after you ask if we would like to try dessert
we shared the bbq chicken flat bread pizza and the spinach dip appetizer
we saw a ton of drunks leaving early and after the long wait why miss out on an allnight party
good people watching snotty valet right out fronteverything we love about scottsdale
i had the prefixe 30  3 course meal opting for a caesar salad duck meatloaf with foie gras mousseline smoked cherry demiglace rosemary millet and topped with grilled asparagus spears and the choice of one of two desserts
i dont fault her at all
just a few negatives  hard to have a conversation because of the acoustics
i have to bring my kids back here for sure they will love this experience
5th time here
great one to catch a good bite of food
the location is fantastic
the fruit that accompanied it was actually very tasty and fresh
then the shticky junk food dessert platter featuring foodie versions of all your favorite crap sno ball cotton candy etc
im not kidding everything that ive gotten from them has been topnotch
what an awesome place
of course there was no room at this waiting bar
its a small place with karaoke at the front and tables and pool table at the back
the other items on the menu that i tried was a cheese and charcuterie plate the blue cheese and the chicken liver pate were my favorites the watermelon salad so good
ill be back for another bowl of ramen sometime
the waiter didnt mind and no fee resulted from two no shows
it appeared that they had toss the wings and the sauce but didnt have enough sauce to completely cover the wings
molasses bread the bread that accompanied the crab was dense with a nice sweet aroma
i would give it a 5 star rating if only the wait time for food was a little shorter but then again it was a busy night and that i understand
frites were really delicious though
next to the building is another bright red object aka the fence but this time its a red painting of a little boy eating what looks like bread
the fish burger was good real fish filet not crispy coated fish but the tomatoes could have been fresher
this place is decent but i am still not satisfied with any of the sushi options in edinburgh
i really wanted macarons for dessert
really torn between a 2 or a 3 review
im definitely a fan
after reading other reviews i see that this is the same chef as the mission which i enjoy
this is our go to date night spot
the best burgers in vegas
cooked medium rare the juices were bursting with beef flavor balanced out by the fried egg
i do however rather like the fact the upstairs seating area overlooks the downstairs bar
loved the breakfast today
not only were the machines very tight but my steak wrap was anything like i was used to
its even better for the weirdos no offense who dont like sushi but could go for a burger
if you make sure to grab a ticket you can get one free bloody mary or mimosa when you get the buffet
it kills me
asked for lemon wedges and bread and butter
for 10 people the booth was tight even though we added two chairs
that or the johnny depp version of willy wonka love that guy
bar de esos que se ven en las pelculas
this place is a throwback dive and i love it
just visiting phoenix and found this great sushi restaurant
either way we ended up having fun and the twinkiesoreos are still worth the visit
ordered the brussels sprouts and ripped potatoes omg delicious
every single soup is good especially the tom kha gai i recommend ordering it very mild if you dont like spice
all the shows we attended were at planet hollywood mandalay bay and caesars
we were late for our after hours event attao that one person in our partys company was hosting
the patio is certainly its best feature and im counting down the days until patio season
the ice cream flat out sucked like generic grocery store ice cream
the waitress was nice as can be very helpful with the menu and giving recommendations which i am a huge fan of when i go to a new place
def coming back
mine was delayed in part because they made a caramel ice coffee on accident their words which they then offered to anyone who was willing to drink something that had been sitting on the bar for 15 minutes
this is the only tropical smoothie that always makes my smoothie taste the way it suppose to
look for waiter toshi or waitress pink they will guide you in ordering exactly what you like and youll have no regrets
in addition to that i went here for my birthday celebration on a saturday evening to dance and enjoy the music
was looking for an epic chocolate cake found it
omg how disgusting
the food isnt bad but nothing special
first time the fish looked grey and the second time it was under cooked
i will definitely be back
very impressed with corkbuzz as a whole
all the better that i can walk there
the chips and salsa are delicious and i always get a burrito topped with their green sauce
who rates this place above 2 stars should go to california and try their tapioca over there
great matthews establishment
i was very impress on everything we had
i appreciate the organization and process to go into the club and all the guards were nice and professional
they served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish
we sat on the patio where they have nice little fire pits you can reserve we sat at a regular table though
she told us they were big and no one eats a whole one
on the service tip it did take a few minutes for my waitress to show up to explain things for me and take my drink order
you kind of forget youre in a strip mall albert a very nice one
it was absolutely divine
the people working there have been there for years and its always nice to see the familiar faces
i tried the pasta but wasnt  that impressed
but this time was not the same
the food is ok i consider this place a little nicer than a typical dive bar
beers are 5
however  because of the wait the parties ahead of us were dropping like flies and we were seated in 15 minutes
for a new business that isnt busy to be so inflexible is garbage  they wont last long with that mentality
service very personable  helpful
a number of people came in after us  so maybe i can let that slide
the broccoli was clearly frozen and just heated up and tossed onto the bed of pasta without any seasonings or cheese
chips were stale and salsa had zero flavor and resembled ketchup
you get soba or udon
great lunch place with good food and good service but not so sure about five stars i dont give those out that easily
we are so glad we did
my favorite place off the strip
but the cheddar beer sauce was incredibly weak and kind of bland frankly
sushi portions are generous
these honestly did not impress me at all i wish they had a bit more spice or zing to them
the staff is amazing and treat every guest like family
including a 4  bud light
i ordered the wings which were delicious and my boyfriends turkey burger was delicious as well but they fell short of the following when the server was taking our order he would walk away as i was speaking to him to assist other people or give his badge to the manager
at the time cut had legit a9 kobe beef from japan on the menu
first the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store
there is a happy hour every day from 430 to 6 pm except for sunday
it seemed to our hero that they have pretty high staff turnover here because he only recognized one server from the last time he came
for starters we got the chicken buffalo dip must try
the dessert was not only tasty but the presentation was top notch
he said we dont have that he was also clueless about a hurricane its basically a rum punch what he served was dreadful   since it was buy 1 get 1 free that night after we drank those drinks and went back to reorder our drinks and we told the bartender to add something to the tom collins to make it sweater what i got back was a red drink nothing in a tom collins should make it red that was really disgustingly gross i didnt drink it
its  a real honky tonk and not some cookiecutter joint
it was monday night so it was probably left over from the weekend the rice was mushy and the sauce was stale is the best way to put it
outside of the chicken everything was very good
ive always found the service to be average
little did i not know that the omakase was sashimi and not nigiri
this continually justifies my urge to stay away from the strip for dining
but we definitely had a great time
the food was delicious and the experience was wonderful
what i love about this place is the food  really fantastic stuff
however i was very disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored
im only giving them a second star because i know the food is great
i wanted collared greens and they were delicious but the side was so big i couldnt finish even though if i remember they were around 5 additional
its on a very good street and there open for lunch every thursday friday and saturday
i was a little scared as a single woman walking in due to a row of guys at the bar and slightly broken dive bar decor but the amazing bartender immediately put me at ease
we will definitely be back
there are usually 5 or so beers on tap and they rotate
nonetheless i will go ahead and complement their awesome cheese and meat board
the pot pie was good but not 90 good
its a little far for me but im game if you are
i added bee pollen to my bowl not knowing the benefits it actually offered
so it can work itself out
while the restaurant was half empty with less than 20 people we waited almost two hours and still missing one food item from our order
like i said will definitely be revisiting akahana sooner rather than later
they can get quite busy on weekend nights so beware of that
really let down by the high yelp ratings that brought us here
ps if you get fries  the sweet potato ones i liked much better than the regular ones
the bar is much too crowded to leave your space and try to make your way to the bar to get a drink
other than our handy manhattans and lots of makers mark we ordered the pork shank and the rabbit pappardelle
i ordered a standard deluxe burger 950 which came on a brioche bun with smoked gouda lettuce tomato and house sauce
i ordered a caipirinha to start
i am not much of a sangria fan but i enjoyed the sips from my wifes glass
before other mama i felt like the only place that sold waffle fries was chick fil a spicy tuna was fresh as well and the portions are very generous as i found myself having enough spicy tuna left even when the fries were almost done
anyway the food is always spectacular and service is better than any other steakhouse
nevertheless i had a great experience here and im really glad i finally tried the food
motley que sandwich average
the servers were attentive wo being overbearing
but i wouldnt have rushed if it was just a lie
never had much luck with liberty village restaurants all are a show but doesnt have good food
though slightly pricier barcelona offers many of the same dishes that i frequent when i dine at firefly stuffed dates camarones al ajillo and a la diabla manchego mac n  cheese their red sangria is good but i have to admit that i do prefer fireflys
i did notice the price increase as most dishes are 12 more than when i last looked at their menu
overall id go here again but the location may be the downfall of this place
place went downhill after they expanded
as to be expected
when i heard the band jamming inside and saw the dance floor packed i was delighted to cough up the 5 cover
the staff is friendly
we didnt even have to pay cover to get into the bar despite that
skinnyfats is a hidden gem
we always tip 20
also had the beet salad which was good
again price point and expectations come into play
i had the carne asada and the ground beef tacosim not going to eat there ever again the food was horrible and the service was even worse
if you sit in the back you will likely either have to strain to hear or not be able to hear clearly
it was a huge dissappointment from the slooooooow service to the overpriced food
i think they added some kind of mayonnaise that makes it more tasty  not too boring for your taste buds
will be back
they didnt bother to season it at all and it looked old
i liked butcher  the brewer very much but i will say its a bit loud
my wife and i shared the burger and the waiter kindly had it split up for us
they were more like biscuits but i guess they call them scones to be a bit classy
dont try to stay here too long about the time i was settling in i was told another  minimum would be required
we arrived at 7pm prime dinner hour
the risotto cakes were decent and came with a nice variety of sauces
the owner hand makes all the menus in english and in japanese
the waiter disappeared so we couldnt find him to inquire as to the delay
i had chicken and waffles
1 ordered the scallops and i in an attempt to try as much as i could ordered the filet mixed grill
i will miss it
very deep but great flick
did see that they do live music too
they seemed totally unconcerned that their customers were robbed in their club
the mexican rice was not that good i would rather have regular white rice to go with my beans
i had a friend try and go back in to find another friend  only to be tackled
the brussel sprouts were good but not great
there are better places in charlotte to eat at
i explained that i didnt want my money back or a meal but they need to discard the rice onions and chicken
and yesterday it must of been an off day cold meats and pineapple was cold
the fried cheese was fairly obviously some frozen product and was mediocre at best for about 8 dollars
this place has gone down hill lately
i automatically spotted the sliced pizza rotating in its display
we waited 10 minutes for the hostess
see pictures for the evidence
i would order the burger again
a friend and i went for lunch last weekend and i was thoroughly impressed
i had the linguine and it was delicious
i want to tell you the ruby room is a great place to go hang out and see local acts while swilling down some tasty beverages
good wisconsin pub fare
i went to the night club part the other day for a prenhl awards event
the chili was just very bland and only lukewarm
theres a piece of blue cotton candy in the glass and you pour your own martini shaker of delicious liquor over it
we were lucky enough to meet michael while we were there and he came and talked to us which just topped the meal off and made our day
good wine selection but the food is way overpriced
slow service  this place the food is overpriced for what you get
spicy ramen had a great flavor
empire palace is now one of my top choices for chinese food  same quality as sesame inn just down the road
my only gripe was that they nickel and dime you for blue cheese celery and extra dipping sauce for the tenders
the other locations are a bit more upscale with a bar and happy hour scene
loved this place and am so sad we waited to eat here on our last day as i would have eaten there several times during the trip if i could have
one of them did chicken wings and the other opted for deviled eggs fruit salad and a pbr  j
great central location
one word okay three chicken pot pie
we normally order to go and they havent messed up an order in quite some time
the sandwich was refined flavorful and only 6 its not meant for someone who wants a hungryman doubledecker meat party on a bun
the place was packed on a wednesday evening and combined with its small size made for quite a good atmosphere
staff was super friendly and was even going to give us ice for our leftovers if we werent going straight home
several of the dishes are drizzled with mayonnaise or have a mayonnaise sauce so mayohaters might not be a fan
service is a bit spotty but the food makes up for the bad service
i also got a beer flight which were 5 decent sized sampling glasses and it was only 7
plus you get to choose hot or cold sake

an old school experience
a friend of mine who is also an avid bubble tea drinker recommended this place to me and  i was so excited to try it that i made the trip all the way to the north york location the very next day
i tried this place out because ive heard good things about it
just keep it pg13 haha
the elk was cooked a perfect medium rare but lacked seasoning on the meat itself however the beet and coffee infused radish helped to round things out
die meisten gerichte der mittagskarte waren durchaus preiswert was man vom rest der karte leider nicht ausnahmslos sagen konnte
we tried the wild mushroom and the cabbage patch plates
we have been here several times before finally deciding to post a review
i would never visit this place again in my life
you would think for a steakhouse you can can a wealth of choices for a bottle to go with your steak but the list was way over the top expensive
we both loved the chicken bits but the mac and cheese is average creamy but not particularly cheesy in taste  a little on the bland side
the staff greeter and server is rather surly  maybe because they have to wear tight flannel shirts in july in vegas
the portion was very generous and i left stuffed which is saying a lot when you only ate sashimi
for someone who isnt racist you just did some pretty fucking racist things and singled me out in a crowd of largely white people in an establishment that has already felt fairly hostile
i thought i was in a hospital cafeteria
i love this place
i think menu may be seasonal so there is hope for the future perhaps
the open plan behind the counter and the hanging lights make you feel as if youre hanging out in your friends kitchen for an afternoon especially with the friendly staff
cheese sauce on the macaroni was nice
i could almost swear they put crack in it or some other equallyaddicting drug
i actually stayed and hung out for over 2 hours not something i normally do but then again i was winning sooo but in all seriousness i think they did a great job with the remodel but its clearly targeting the younger crowd so if you dont like loud music this place is not for you
as a life long anglophile i ordered fish and chips and a popover starter
first time here with my buddies
i recommend the rattle snake roll
i love the paintings on the wall
was it posted in front or did the waiter tell us when we sat down
how do you mess up edamame
the only turnoff for me was the crowd
staff was all super friendly
and i am a coffee snob it is a blend made especially for the restaurant
monks can be really crowded some times but the staff stays on top of getting people in
do we just ask how long
great tiki cocktails off the strip and away from the madness
ordered the chicken fajitas and again was surprised at how bland and unseasoned everything was
i ordered the brown bag chicken salad sandwich and it was phenomenal
the sushi chefs are talkative and very friendly
wish they opened before 11 on weekends though
sushi roku has the most amazing service
wait for what
i booked well in advance as i like to have things planned
i dont know who hired the brew master but they need to seriously drop the guy or theyll suffer as others ive spoken to who have been have had similiar feelings
made it seem dirty
do not hesitate ever to walk in
the service is generally bad the tacos are good the picnic tables feel dirty and its an okay place to stop in for a beer
its about 45 aisles and theres clearly not enough games to go around
service is brisk and cheerful regulars get japanese chopsticks for christmas
the french fries were out of this world
the manager came over and apologized and seated us and then proceeded to tell us the specials walked away and no one came back for 15 minutes
its thin crust which i prefer and makes you feel like youre not missing out on anything that those peeps with no gluten allergy can have
ack but im not rushing to go back again any time soon
i plan on trying their chicken and vegetarian dishes next
within 10 minutes we were called headed back to the restaurant and taken to a great table with fantastic peoplewatching potential
we were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow
asu students  i hope you know how good you got it
90 of the staff at this location is african american from observation
beer9 over priced cute but not worth it
we are a 40 something couple you think we are going to dineanddashreally
wanted to take the kidscollege aged out and wanted to go someplace they have not been for a while
i always saw  heard about it but never had the chance to test it out for myself  boy am i glad i did
i could rant over this restaurant all night
this was after going inside after 10 minutes and complaining with the promise of sending someone right out
and the crisp breaded onion rings were not  and all this for only 54 after tax and tip iced tea no drinks
she was not able to replenish our drinks very quickly
fish was really fresh
after a number of friends recommended soul i decided to give it a try
the beef and blue cheese bruschetta is a great idea and had fantastic flavor but there were pieces of meat on it that were literally not cooked
weekend buffet exceeded my expectations
just a tip should add some pickles  ill definitely be eating here again
the almond chocolate croissants were also exceptionally delicious
to be fair maybe i should have read some of the other reviews first and planned accordingly  bc they are byob friendly until they become a licensed liquor provider finally i understand making you order up front during the lunch rush but i think they should take orders at the bar after five pm
it would be 45 stars for the product and it gets dropped to 15 for the portion size and price
that is what i ordered along with a glass of merlot
who does that attract
i told our waiter luka who said he would tell the kitchen but i never heard anything more
the pink elephant spicy crab shrimp tempura sweet mustard wasabi is pricey at 16 bucks but at a place like this thats to be expected
conveyor belt sushi restaurant
2 drinks ordered with a set of nachos  the management team was standing there taking pictures of the amazing drink art  unfortunately there wasnt any coordination on which drink is out  who chronologically has been serviced  maybe this type of place is meant for the people that are willing to donate money and walk away without drinks or food  horrible service  horrible coordination  cant come back
mostly because they dont have a dance space yet have some pretty good musicbut if youre not much of dancer this may be just what youre looking for
they know in advance that it is half priced martini night
but to them its anything but a horror story
3 easy tips 1 go during the day 2 sit at the bar 3 jay will take care of you
nothing like a perfectly seasoned fry dipped in entirely too much ranch
if you love sushi you have to try this place when you come to vegas
its definitely family friendly which is a huge plus
we have had these at most other places and this one just seemed skimpy on the amount of seafood
if i simply repeated that expression about 10000 times it would not come close to the experience that my wife and i had here in vegas
and the ones that didnt work  he stayed far too long
decent casual southwestern inspired food
hoping that they dont sense our fear we push through a weak spot in the sausage circle getting lots of catcalls and comments as we do
wash your hands sir
will definitely visit again
the food is ok as is the service
after those heavy appetizers i had the cobb salad for my entree
there is some serious competition for the booths and window seats you might have to wait a couple hours for people to leave and the seating is not all that plentiful
i wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to come back but i do hope this spot finds its niche
i liked the taste it was pretty addicting
when the meals arrived we just kinda looked at the mac n cheese    where were the tomatoes
i will always be a return customer
fast forward to out steal which was gteat seasoned to perfection cooked eight and the veggies werent bad
not so much that you get lost but covers enough for everyones tasteand its full of jokes and hilarious descriptions
i think kabuki should be best known for their sushi
eddie merlots is as good as all of the rest of them
the place was humming
as a frequent traveler i am always disappointed with airport food offerings hometown austin airport is among the worst
what a fun relaxing way to end the day
we sat on the sushi bar close to the door so we get cold whenever people come and go but we were so hungry that we didnt want to wait for a table
he was well knowledge of the beer list and very helpful with suggestions of our food items
my date had the fish and his was great too
stuffed piquillo peppers omg
the morning prices would fall in the  category rather than the
no discount either
i am not sure if their recipe was off or what but i was left disappointed in the taste
so just be prepared
what was more disappointing is when i order a 16 piece sushi platter and end up with less than 16 pieces
the beans were good famous daves are much better but its a different style of beans
this most recent visit i had the falafel and before that i want to say it was an openfaced ham sandwich cant quite remember
best brew spot at kent state
i tried my crack pie soft serve first
i usually call in to go from the 5 dollar lunch menu during the weekday
im very picky when it comes to mexican food so a 4 12 star rating means this place is legit
the vibe was classy and fun
large portion sizes gluten free menu with numerous pho options great vibes  and friendly staff
no air flow whatsoever seriously its summer
i love everything about this place and i hope to be back soon
the sushi is good but im not always in the mood for it and am not super adventurous with it
this place looks a tad bit dated on the outside and inside for that matter but dont let that discourage you
huge outdoor patio is also available
served me with much better service
went here due to the recommendation of a friend thinking that a cool bar couldnt be in downtown cornelius
this place is fantastic
just wish they had more times chairs get booked quick
i do not plan to return anytime soonif ever
the pork ribs are awesome
we were not asked if we would like the corn
during daylight hours this place is relaxing and a cool spot to hang out
the music was at just the right volume for the dinner
if benelux is near my house i think i will be here during the day and do some work and drink beersinstead of going to a library or starbucks
if you want to go get drunkgo to a bar in the desert
the mussels were plump and fresh and the tomato broth was worth asking for extra bread or a straw
the burger was done perfectly
nice booths pleasant server great salad two bucks extra but very good  wonderful bread but entrees were soso
i wont stay if shes at the bar again
ive done takeouts and ive done dineins
everything was delicious and top notch
i started with the tomato feta and baby arugula salad then some of the best dinginess crab piece you will get anywhere and finished it off with one of the best bone in filets i have ever had
lets just say that the pool hall with terrible lighting we walked through was packed with a very young crowd and when a few of us actually walked through the said metal push doors to check out mi lounge we were so disappointed at how different the set up looked from all the photos on their website
prices were very reasonable
i walked into dancing gnome before a penguins game so i only had time to drink one pint and sample others
i came here for a business lunch recently and was impressed with the decor and ambiance the second i walked in
the good news is that her son adam is now the head chef
also my seabass was cooked so beautifully and with just such a light touch that it was meltingly tender
those three would have to be my top favorites out of the course but every single dish was amazing and there was no complaints whatsoever
service started out slow
i finally got a bartenders attention after about 15 minutes
fantastic cannot wait to go again
at times ill call in advance
all in all despite some of the drawbacks the food strange people etc i still have a really good time
the waiters were incredibly social and super chill
overall mediocre meal with lackluster service at a high price
the donuts themselves were amazing couldnt go wrong with any one of them
and theres booths and tables
we get stuffed in a corner when we walk in and we had premium tickets
maybe my math is off but it seems like you get 10 when you spend 2000
if youre in the area this is the shop to go to for your caffeine fix and also to support a great local small business
loser o you lose
bees knees  12 handcrafted cocktails
only good thing about it is the price of beer food was sad ambience was sad many better places nearby
couldnt bring myself to try the chicken tacos they smelled odd and the meat was dry and covered in a sauce
they have a various selection of juices and food
fries were cold and hard the slaw was mia wings were depressing
and again for the nonsushisnob its delicious
besides being a mess it was disgusting to look at
this burger was the same
there was an issue between spacing between our dishes and it was acknowledged right away not once but 3 times
i ordered vegan ramen and my boyfriend ordered vegan soba noodles
decent beer selection but i can get that somewhere with better service and less creepy older dudes trying to get in my space
i guess i should have canceled but i was being patient
i usually sit in the restaurant but no more
sushi was great presence of food on a bamboo surfboard was super creative
i like the cosy ambiance and big arm chairs super friendly service and freshly made food
id return but it would have to be when its less busy
needless to say that we are definitely on the verge of never going back again
we ordered ahi nachos and potstickers to start and both were good but not stellar
the family and i frequent this location as well as the centennial shop
never ever again
the best combinationoutstanding service and amazing food
price is high but for fine dining in las vegas it is definitely worth the cost
i cant believe we only paid 60night
it turned out to be a nice combination of flavors
well definitely return
ive only been here once the night of nuit blanche and i enjoyed it
this place is my new jam
second the waitress said she was taking our desserts plural off of the check yet only my wifes was removed
a bottomrung toronto sushi joint
we can tell the staff does not like them either
they were not skimpy with the alcohol
once i drained my water glass it was never refilled despite a request
immediately moves into my top 3 places to eat in las vegas
cool experience literally but once was enough for me
everything was flawless from start to finish
a great venue for anyone who enjoys live music blues performed by adept performers
not only did she have a bad attitude at the get go she glared at us when we told the bartender she did not pick up our food check
yes i understand the dishes are small
ive watched a few soccer matches at the downtown san diego yard house never been impressed
i was impressed with the timeliness of our server
overall their teriyaki chicken was very good
silverware would have really made my dining experience better as i wasnt eating the stale bread
as of right now sakana hasnt been beat
i had a kirin beer
this is kinda the place u go to to just observe
but everything else i experienced was just meh
i asked for medium but the burger is subjected to some special meatchoppinggriddlecooking process they said it can only be prepared well done
that was just ridiculous
i missed out on the nyc location and was looking forward to trying it here in vegas
havent tried much of the food but what i had was good
wait staff was friendly attentive and efficient
i really want to like this place because of all the pictures i see on my instagram and facebook feed
their french fries are also tasty
the decor and ambiance
comes with a nice salad and bread
caesar was drenched
otherwise youll be waiting longer than youd like
they didnt seem to mind at all  now more importantly the food
not really what i want in a lounge with those types of amazing drinks and yes they were amazing
goldies has very good food
so it felt kind of stagnant and stifling not ideal when you want to relax
also if you wear blue on sunday alcohol is half price
i ordered the thai chicken protein bowl with the sweet potato hash
this locale is only open on loungelike nights and special occasions and its true it has the ability to be a bit clubby but with atmosphere this pretty it attracts a mature crowd
took boys here to watch football
it might just be the grand opening show they are putting on but the food was great the service was quick and i couldnt argue with the 20 discount
the sweetie roll was mainly some spicy tuna which had the perfect spice level for sushi
the location is great and the atmosphere is fun and friendly
was in the neighborhood again and popped in around 1pm my daughter is vegan now and we were iffy on ayce but our very nice waitress showed her the many choices so it was a go
i lived down the street 7 years ago and the manager still greets me on a first name basis every time im in town for work
the fresh sea bass was sweet and tender
5 appetizers to start japanese salad rice porridge miso soup seafood salad and jap chae
everything was excellent
we been going for years to this ice cream store
unfortunately the bar stools were extremely uncomfortable
they give you discounts 10 for eating at the sushi bar or going to their other location if the one you are at is flooded with people 15 if you do takeout
our food was obviously sitting there when they checked on it
the shrimp was incredible
the one across from us at dobsonguadalupe is always packed and it is awful
we went last week for a friends birthday
die bedienung hatte es berhaupt nicht eilig  wir mussten ziemlich lang warten
if i return to phoenix i will stop by here again to try the beer
often times they get a bit assertive about phones and cameras when their really is no need
definitely my goto place in the city
since theyve been under new management the quality has gone up
i got all excited when i was assigned to work in pittsburgh again
its a wonderful restaurant and bar but she was a horrible bartender and incredibly rude
for a purportedly famous place this wasnt half bad
give this place a try youll love it
we sat on the patio at a refectory table an elongated table used originally for dining in monasteries in medieval times or the late middle ages
i will definitely come back for their good burgers
the booth was all wood no padding but not really uncomfortable
i offer this as a warning to those with food sensitivities
dark inside center bar with everything u want to drink and people smoking hookahs
they have a decent hot counter with breakfast sausage eggs bacon lunch usually chickenbeef and ricepotatoes
as our secondi we got lasagna and i have to be honest nonna makes the best lasagna hands down but this reminded me of it and if it can do that then i am truly satisfied
definitely would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for a good laid back night
honestly if im eating fries they better be cooked in lard and taste like pig guts and i dont care about the trans fats
my friends had no complaints either
the owner james was was able to give me some great advice and choosing the best supplement needed for my diet goal on my second visit cause the first was just amazing my son and i both were  was a little under the weather so james recommend a ginger shotwoah it knock the cold right out of us we were geeat the next day
after all that we were really stuffed and then noticed that patrons around us ordered the calamari which looked bomb so id recommend that even though i didnt try it cuz i know my calamari by sight and am confident enough in my abilities to make such a recommendation
the food is great and you will leave satisfied
tried braised last week as we live in the hood
yes midday traffic on rainbow is awful but parking is easy so you should go
really love this place
service was prompt and courteous for me but i do note some of the other reviews and see where the size of this place could really get away from servers and host staff on a busy night  if they dont have the experience to handle it
for lunch i chose the grilled ham  cheese chili and fries
the staff is always kind the drinks are strong the wings are outstanding
i was really excited once i saw all the differenct varieties of bruschetta we could choose from
this place has terrible food
i tried a samburger which comes with 1000 island applewoodsmoked bacon onions and usually mayonnaise which i changed to dijon mustard
shes very nice
i had lamb which was good
charming staff as well
this menu was like a roadmap in an amusement park
although the appetizers they have are great would like to see more something to go with the awesome beer cheeselike soft pretzels
if i didnt know better id of thought this was opening night with new service staff and kitchen help
i remember i had cook who was very funny and singing all the time
their onion rings are to die for
this place has really good food the service is terrific and the price is right
there were little bowls of candies and chips you can buy just to munch while youre gaming and thats a great gimmick
we are here for the second time and i have a pad thai and it was wonderful
there are a lot of beers and the waiting staff will help you choose depending on what you like which is very helpful as i said awesome waiting staff
salmon teriyaki  we ordered one unit but two units came
id consider this place more of a bar where you can watch sports rather than a place to come and get a good meal
newly opened so they didnt have their liquor license yet but it should be pretty soon
i heard there were some predictable service issues when they first opened but we experienced minimal mixups today billing had to go back for a quick fix and our wait had to come back to clarify an order but really no big deal for a new place
although sometimes they get really busy and you end up having to wait a bit but thats with any decent restaurant the fact that they are always busy should tell you that the food and beer is pretty damn good
we ordered a couple of classic cocktails and ordered a few specials they had for the day and we were not disappointed
enjoyed happy hour food and drink menu followed by delicious pizza and chocolate creme brulee
while the people were extremely friendly and the restaurant was clean and had a great atmosphere the food was sorely lacking in taste and quality
after living in the bay area for nearly four years and visiting several delicious burger joints i was a little skeptic of my fond memories of delicious burgers from dotty dumplings
awesome view of the las vegas strip with all the neon lights and nightlife below
i think i also saw him helping the sushi chefs too
though the romaine confidently snapped and crunched beautifully the warm part was absent
the food was really good and reasonably priced
one time i went to the ladies room i went back and my brand new drink was gone
the wellness smoothie on the other hand was great
i saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters a few seasians and several old people
i cannot tell you how often they have forgotten my chips when i go through drive thru
the taste of the food was good
baby pen for the underage at an all age show
i wont eat any other ice cream here in las vegas
im glad i didnt because the portions were well worth the money
but its worth the madness
i ordered two burgers to go and was unpleasantly surprised when i got home less than 1 mile from the nitty to an ice cold meal
the entire boat was superb
these two are the reasons why our visit today got better
i had a quesadilla and chicken salad
loved it
returned for dollar sushi upon all the good yelp reviews but found that it really wasnt worth it either
then i spent the whole next day trying to coax my ears to feel normal again
cant wait to go back
the fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light not like most other places with thick fatty ranch
ive been a customer for a long time and this place has really come into its own in the last year or so now that mike has things the way he wants them
here is the best part the sushi was a 1
a great neighbor restaurant
i have to think this place gets its business from word of mouth advertising and i know that since i moved away from ohio that my parents still meet up there with their friends we even met up when i was visiting here a few months back
my prawns were cooked to rubber
its one of those places that is so dark that when you come in on a bright sunny day youre a little disoriented for a couple seconds
the selection of whiskey and draft beer is amazing
what i dont enjoy
i came here for poutine week but unfortunately they had sold out   i had a mushroom okonomyaki instead which was amazing on flavour and portion size
review 332              have been coming here for quite sometimes but havent gone back for a year at least
i will return but will not get the no name server again
even raw vegans know carbs are life
had the duck fat fries and buffalo chicken wings neither of which were great
before we left we ordered the tater tots with blue cheese and artichoke dip to go
not cheap but not bad for the airport
visited this spot last sunday to watch a football game and i was impressed
plenty of tv screens
crowded noisy trashy bar atmosphere with average priced drinks at best and mediocre wings in relation to size meatiness overall quality but again sauce selection is above average
for what it was it was decent but being that it was drowning in mayo turned me off
that shit was drenched in it
must have a been a bad night i got there but i can still smell soot
the tea was bland and tasted just like straight up water so i asked to change it to a milk tea which had a better taste
or perhaps i should say inside the box
for drinks snacks and a cozy atmosphere
i have been frequenting robbie foxs since they opened primarily for lunch or during happy hour
would go back for sure
okay this is another local favorite
bread crumbs and heavy amounts of acidic red sauce atop spaghetti noodles summarizes this dish
its nice if you can sit on the outside patio if its not too hot outside
i was contacted by the owner and offered a replacement for my meal
i would have preferred it plain because i didnt like the flavor
never coming back and i would never recommend this place to anyone
we ate at the high top tables at the bar and had a great time
the delux burger actually reminds me a lot of the pork belly sandwich at roli roti except roli roti uses pork and this place uses beef
the guacamole was really good but the chips were not
another great place to go in the neighborhood
en rsum bouffe et service extraordinaire
i highly recommend the spicy togarashi shrimp for an appetizer because its amazing
the late night events may have a cover but never for the early shows
its so worth it when its all perfect timing though
great selection of whisky and cigars they got bar machines too and we just hit a royal flush
i want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes
the falafal burger with bacon ha was all kinds of splawsome
i really wish fiamma was here in the bay area it would be a regular haunt
reading the other reviews you will see many examples such as live uni live sweet shrimps live fish options and live mussels which we ordered
anyone that knows me will know hands down that good french fries will get me back for a second visit
i would be a regular i will go back every time im in phoenix fo sho
my daughter her friend and i went into the store to buy ice cream cones
it was pretty quiet for a saturday night but it was raining on and off all day
there are far more satisfying experiences to be found nearby
15 we ordered about 100 oysters on a tuesday night because of the special malpeque oysters are the only ones that are 1 for a 1
im not really familiar with the historic tremont area but decided to check out barrio
a dumplings dish i really cant remember  it was nothing spectacular though and i didnt get the fusion element in that one
great experience for my first time  sushi is great
i had the steak and eggs
and the baristas pour a tasty brew
god forbid you ask for a lager beer its like asking for a taco on a silver platter
we walked up to there hostess station and there were three of them standing there talking amongst themselves with there back turned to us
great ambience
the staff is friendly
i made our reservation at 630 thinking that would give us plenty of time to get to the show by 830 since it was down the street
my friends and i had so much fun
close to airport and freeway we had a car
the service was perfect they were so attentive
i told the valet attendant to call for help
the atmosphere is tranquility
cute little lounge
i have to really try not to laugh when inside the evening muse which makes me want to really laugh i think this is probably a really great place for a lot of people
we got there in time for happy hour so we ordered appetizers
they do the standard show here for this type of place but its done well
the service is always fantastic and the atmosphere is always fun no matter if its 6pm or 12am
the food has been consistently decent each time we have dined
if it werent for the decent service and my husbands enjoyment of his meal i wouldnt have given this the rating i did
over priced and the food is terrible
our server was friendly attentive knew the components of every dish and made no pressures on us
the consistency of it suggested that there was no pasta covering at all
anyhow this place is pretty solid all the way around
great food prices beer and service
the bartender took our orders filled our drinks while our waitress sat at the bar still on her phone
if harvard  highland stays as popular as it was this past saturday theyre going to need to hire more help
in addition to some pretty mediocre service this place has some real crappy policies
oh my there were indeed fine
immediate descriptors would begloomy sad wannabe pretentious no real signage or direction as to where things are on the property
it had a great patio for cocktail hour
we hope we can come back soon
werent even offered seating outside instead we were seated back near the kitchen where the servers all walk by with the food
it wasnt the most beautiful clean place ive ever been
only two or three employees on the floor for this situation
cant wait to go back again and try new things
this place has a nice decor
really decent prices
especially the short fat guy that wear glasses
i heard the former is the popular one
as we stepped out of the bright contemporary well lit entry we hit an immediate disconnect on the casino floor
the only safe face factor is they got busy after a concert let out
i did however enjoy my peruvian caipirinha and would recommend that
i wanted to at least think it was funny but it wasnt
i really wish though that they would put a bathroom in the restaurant area instead of having us walk outside and into the casino to use the bathroom but maybe thats just wishful thinking on my part
from the outside you might thing weird spot for a sushi joint to be honest i was always curious about what was inside the roundwindowed building
it came out quickly and they were some of the best nachos ive ever had
while that is enough to earn one star how they handled the issue is even worse
by the way this was from the signature tasting menu
i love the roncy neighbourhood but were running out of places to eat
highlights included the lobster ravioli made to order yum
i plan to go there this saturday morning again and invited my two brothers to join me
its a fairly new restaurant and i was so impressed i thought they deserved a good review
they told me to come back at night when there are friendlier and more competent people working
this is definitely the place to not only eat but get a good conversation in
downtown vegas also reminds me of hollywood you got people in the middle putting on side shows people dressed up as celebrities for pictures and street kids putting on a dance show
great smoke good beers and wines
i have yet to be dissapointed whether seated in the dining room or choosing to eat at the bar
auch alkoholfreie cocktails fehlen auf der reichhaltigen getrnkekarte nicht
ok i may just be a typical tourist but i loved this place
volume increased as the night progressed and drinks multiplied gradually making conversation at our table a bit challenging
15 for a gormet burger
what differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing
there are about 10 tvs here so there are plenty to go around
its an experience
i called ahead of time to the hotels players club to see how to redeem the coupon and they told me to redeem it at unami burger
they have live music at times which is nice but way too loud for dinner
try his mango tango this is his award winning drink that he creatively designed
i might check it out again as a club but i was surprisingly impressed with cathouse as a restaurant
great local feel family atmosphere and service
food atmosphere decor location music service cleanliness even the restroom
10 minutes later and no one came by to check on us
the bartender filled the draft beer all the way to the rim of the glass and made the beer flat
i usually go here on the weekends and they occasionally have live music that is a great addition to the experience
blue cheese potato chips are so bomb
im skeptical of ordering them when out for dinner because ive noticed a lot of times they are just frozen boca patties and the edges get all hard and inedible when cooking
the sushi rice was not cooked properly
the town looks like anywhere small town america usa
i got those and avocado rollsvery tasty
finally the song was over and he opened his arms up like he was going to hug her
the steamed buns had some flavor but were mostly disappointing
the salsa and chips werent complimentary
the only amusing thing i witnessed that night was this jackass hitting on this girl
my favorite hot dish was the unagi doria the combination of cheese eel and rice just melts in your melt
the music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun
i will not refer anyone to go here
i could literally walk the four five blocks get plastered and walk home with no incidence
the service was also perfect
the tostado shell was overcooked the enchilada was unremarkable and the tamale had very little meat in it and tasted just like the enchilada
however we noticed that other tables got bread and olive oil and we did not
and if you are a smoker you can smoke at your table and not have to go to the smoking area which i thought was convenient
built into a former yogurt shop and adjacent to the everpopular breakfast and lunch spot ncounter this establishment is a nice addition to the often everchanging and sandwich and pizza heavy food scene on mill avenue
2  the food is gross
had the bone marrow every time
there was 6 of us and at the end of the dinner we did sake bombs together and that was a fun first as well
also free wifii will definitely be returning
why dont more places do that
timing can be a big deal
the bloody mary i ordered was classic delicious perfection
i ordered a shrimp poboy and it didnt disappoint
which i wasnt even aware of till i ordered
had the ipa and maybe tried a second good you cant park nearby because you will not be driving home
good happy hour
i helped in all of the original mastro restaurants and this was my first time to steak 44 i learned all my high standards from the mastro family and i have to admit steak 44 is their most finest yet
there are other bad reviews too online
the dueling piano boys are raunchy and hilarious
she ended up giving us the second viva roll for free and some coupons
lunch time specials are like eating back home and the rest of the food in the menu covers a wide range of dishes of authentic peruvian flavor from ceviche to lomo saltado and chupe de camaron to aji de gallina
mmmmm sushi sushi
whether filet mignon prime rib ribeye flank or top sirloin it tasted the same
either chow bella has never had proper chicken and waffles or del friscos did some serious impressing
it was all there
id order it again
cut was one of my favorite steakhouses and i used to recommend it to everyone but after tuesday night i cant say that anymore
trendy without the attitude
the one thing that really bugs me is that when  restaurant takes time to decorate their place and make it feel welcoming it needs to extend to the bathroom
the spicy miso burger is definitely a knifeandforker
i would not change a thing
my boyfriend and i decided to visit the klassik for dinner
service was slow
it felt like  everyone was trying to show off their business cards or the fake tits they bought their wivesgirlfriendssecretaries
the menu with pictures is difficult to read because there are no prices
my husband loves the housemade pork rinds but my favorite will always be the ropa vieja until i can figure out how to make a similar one at home
i would highly recommend this place especially to people celebrating an extraspecial occasion
i chose a half order of the gnocchi with duck ragout as my second course
i got a salad which was delicious the girls got tacos and were so impressed so many options
above all else they had one job having brew at a brew house
drinks are affordable entertainment is great and i love the outside and open concept
awesome food and awesome mojitos and sangrias
nonetheless if you have a group of friends and want to check out a great place for some bowling and bbq this is the best spot in charlotte to hit up
it is that expletive
if the ny was a little leaner i wouldve given 55
the place itself it dimly lit but gives off a warm feeling
obsessed is an understatement
my friends ordered the banana cracker jack cheesecake and they devoured it
the rest of my party did enjoy their tacos the variety of salsas and the nice day we spent on their patio
it was a quick zip up the 404 and we were there in a flash
the one thing that is terrible is the parking
there are other good options around bar raval
so i asked the bartender the same question even though he heard me ask the other guy and could have faked some customer service by answering with a simple yes or no and he says yes in an extremely irritated tone of voice
and the order they got was the same as ours
they have tons of variety in the pasties past ease whether youre looking for meat fish or veg
cute individualized packing in little green cardboard foldable boxes if youre getting only one or two and an even cuter small green box that folds into itself if you decide to go for the better deal of getting five cakes at once
drink glasses were empty hard to get refills
they brought the meat we order and it was ok the server didnt make our grill as hot so our meat cooked longer
just an excellent meal all around
i highly recommend it
the bartender is never anything but rude and disrespectful to my boy and iim not sure if its because we are young but that still is not any excuse to treat us the way he has multiple times
everyone basically ignored it after one taste
dessert my husband talked me out of my usual chocolate gotos and into the sweet mess
it was pretty annoying since by the time we got our food it was cold too
as a place to hang out and drink great beers this is the place to go
whenever we are in the area we stop in for a beer and a pretzel
its great for the amateurs and even fun for the pros
great stop  recommend if your in the miracle mile shops
as of recently 3 brewers have been opening a few locations in the gta
was advised to come here
the machines themselves work very well and it was so much fun playing actual coins and seeing them clink into the coin return tray
i like it because there are various tastes and styles
we saw a great band here and it was amazing
i most definitely will take the drive down to jozo whenever and im absolutely glad that i took the time to check it out
thats a little pricy
our service was stellar and i am sorry i dont remember her name
allerdings war uns persnlich die musik etwas zu laut ansonsten gehen wir sehr gerne und hufig ins mauritius
with such a large group it was difficult to decide on a place to eat prior to the show
the server then came over and told me she was fixing the bill which had already been presented
he really enjoyed both
the menu covers all the bases salads sandwiches burgers wraps  and also more upscale entrees
this place has a really cool atmosphere going on
great dinner and servicechilean sea bass chicken satay lobster wontons 5 spice ribs and classic pad thai
i gave him a very detailed description of my more recent visit  and he responded with a 200 gift certificate to give them another shot
we came here when the parking at greens new veg was full and we were too lazy to park across the busy street and run for our lives
they played it at a decent volume thank you and was probably someones itunes playlist of hits from the 90s
this place was gross and depressing
the service sucked
didnt even have sapporo in just asahi and kirin
i ate there a few times with my wife we are both vegans
worst restaurant manager of all st louis locations by far impolite no welcoming attitude and for sure do not care about customer satisfaction think he is not even aware of the term
they are the best chinese food
well it was all okay
currently im 1 for checkins here at juans flaming fajitas
they have a huge selection here and i was able to try something id never have ordered on my own
we complained several times about the heat in the restaurant of a temp around 30 degrees
i dont get the hype
they tasted very fresh
guinness was fresh and tasty just like it was served in dublin
cant wait to go back
the mni chimis are delicious and plenty for 2 people
i cant stress this enough
their fish is not the best as everyone claims
cheap drinks nice interior
she was just getting off work for the night
im glad i got the small size but if you want the small size and you want to add chicken to it like i did be prepared for a 11 salad
i can tolerate this place when someone else wants to go but see no reason to eat here on my own accord
the head chef michael smith also said a few words then got back to the kitchen to put the finishing touches on some tiny little sangria cakes topped with grapes and berries for dessert
ate dinner tonight with my girlfriend and sat at the bar tommy was our bartender he was great and very knowledgeable about the food and his recommendations were spot on
the server had it with him on an ipad when he greeted us
a definite goto spot for special occasions
id been to a bahama breeze near seattle a couple years ago and it screamed chain
einen tv gute sicht hat
i also thought what does this 90lb wet little woman know about eating slabs of meat
saturday they had a live hawaiian band playing in the outside area and it was really nice i actually enjoyed it a lot
it was clear the fish was fresh which is a big plus
thats just not ok if the quality is complete garbage
repeatedly address patrons that were coming and going to as you two and you guys
i decided to take a chance throw caution to the wind and try somethin new
its never packed and i always feel at ease and relaxed the feeling i should feel when enjoying sushi
for the quality of food the prices are decent
when i bit into this burger  i could taste the sugar in the bun
my friend and i left the first time because there were no tables but so much extra space to walk around
i will not be coming back here
margaritas were good but overpriced for the serving size
the best things about this restaurant is the set up and ambience including the patio
for 6 i got plenty of brunch and tasty too
this place never disappoints
she stormed off banging dishes around and gave us nasty looks
tuna roll was probably the worst i have ever eaten
now they are available just around the corner from where i live
the place is situated just off the main casino entrance and sitting outside was lovey and quiet
sometimes bigger is not better
three stars or aok is definitely how i would describe this place
also i felt as though the chef was rushed and just did a very basic routine
although it is a little bit pricy it takes so good will try other flavor next time
very friendly knew the menu and was very fluent in the preparation of the sushi that we ordered
ill definitely come back but the next time without the hangover
food was good and came out very presentable
i will definitely continue my visits
then we moved on to the hibachi food
avoid at all costs
the people here are always friendly and calm  theres no feeling like you have to race through your meal so they can get the table back
when asked how i preferred my eggs i said as hard as possible to which our server suggested scrambled
but they are fresh and the place seems clean and orderly
the salmon sashimi just completely turned me off to trying any other nigiris
hopefully ill have more time to hang out and try their food too because its a great little tap room
love the food here
excellent service including prompt water refills
the food while the ambiance may just be me being too critical i feel the food is what really takes this place down from my experience
but the unorganized and unprofessional service really needs improvement
if id wanted a tostada id have ordered one thats not pizza flavoured
no soup on the menu
5 the bartenders or mixologists know their shit and if you tell them what your taste buds like they will whip you up something fabulous
we had untouched drinks a damaged cigar a ruined evening and zero response from the hotel
we were there for happy hour and were very dissapointed
the refried beans are made right there in the restaurant and they grill the shrimp fresh to order
good stuff d i love their sushi even thought the wait was long it was worth it
color me impressed
youve probably seen her there
and again it took a very long time to get my check and pay
i recommend to have food here
first time in charlotte and found this place
i have only ordered togo at this location since its right next to my gym so after a good workout i always crave some boneless wings
would recommend parking across the street of parking lot  walking over
since we all bought the lunch special we could all share and good times were had
youd be better staying on in one of the other budget hotels in the area or downtown
arugula salad was pretty awesome
for a special night out go to eddie vs
the only thing that was good was the honey garlic sauce
once getting the bill the mistakes where still on there which is ridiculous and a unconvincing prompt sorry was given
steak chicken shrimp scallops sashimi sushi sushi rolls the onion soup the vegetable tempura and so on
the cheeseballs are  deep fried cheese in quartersize balls served with ranch
i approached the waitress about it and she acted like it was a new order
sarai was awesome she kept them coming
for someone who enjoys a sweeter tea i would probably order 12 sweet next time
freshii is a fresh fast food eatery that offers healthy salads wraps bowls burritos soups frozen yogurt juices and smoothies
i love the caribbean creepers wings
i was told that the manager would come to speak to me
it was hard to decide what to pick
stopped here for lunch
top that with fries and another beer that she had ready for me as soon as i was a swallow away from empty and i was a happy customer
their wings are amazing  the hot wings are truly hot which is awesome
justin was attentive and had a great personality
the ambiance was so welcoming and all of the patrons  incredibly friendly
food is amazing i recommend the tiger shrimp tacos or the arrachera tacos
only two miller lite and coors lite
so first visit to bjs in desert ridgeand my last
located right in the plaza at the intersection of woodbine and 16th ave where the tnt plaza is
great place for ping pong in york region
the appetizers are horribly greasy but its so good
i would definitely do this again in the future i enjoyed myself and the 3 hours flew past
i was impressed how cooperative the staff was since we had such a large party with no reservation
pollo abobado chicken braised wih garlic onion dark soy and bay leaf
tip top food
thanks for the good pours on the tequila
no this is because i ordered a latte and when the barista started to tell me there were no espresso beans he was cut off by the manager who was pouring ethiopian into the grinder
this place was introduced to me about 6 years ago and i make sure i go every time im in vegas not even the food poising outbreak at the old location could stop me lol
and someone who was doing prep work and serving
the biscuit  gravy was good
my 2 friends ended up meeting two married men from out of townsleazy but they are single so had a good time
i mean based off the one thing i ordered
omg this place was the s
wings from lee next door are off the chain
you can order a sample of the house beers and go from there
every time my husband and i travel we like to take baths but never have any bath salts or bubbles
my tipping motto if you decide for me you get what you asked for
i love her
that was a huge negative but we were craving the french toast and decided to let it slide
finally found a sushi place thats pushing the limits
one of my favourites on danforth
we requested a bottled beer as it was clear that something was wrong with the draft
each bowl truly is a work of art
never again lesson learned
so you know there has to be a reason
pretty empty when we arrived
only one pool area was open when i was there
as far as im concerned the ambiguity doesnt really matter
i work in the service industry and was stone sober
the manager brought back the new salad and asked again what happened to the first and after repeating it he actually didnt say much about it
this place is more about atmosphere and where to eat if you have a glittery scottsdale shirt you need to show off
its nicely balanced has just a teeny tiny amount of burned edges of cheesenoodleand the meat is moist like a meatloaf
what great speakeasy
first things first im a mahoosive jazz snob
i think this is a great place to take friends from out of town
the food and the view are both well worth it
i liked how they sealed the cup up too which was kinda interesting
i would love to try it for happy hour or in the evening
it was just plain awkward
it was exactly what i wanted on a hot az summer day
i cant believe that no one has reviewed it yet
the rep i worked with was efficient and thoroughly explained the amenities available and i was on my way to the world tower
check his pic in the gallery  tip him good and he will take damn good care of you
the bartender was great
i gave them the benefit of the doubt when we first got there and they wouldnt seat our group even though we made a reservation because they assumed that we were going to be using the chef but we did not
this place will always be a four star to me because unlike your fancy smancy strip dessert the actual chef works here and is right in front of you preparing artistry
the live band playing that night was dr feelgood a tribute to everyones favorite kings of la sleaze
the pool area upstairs was also very nice and relaxing loved the tablepoolside service and everyone is always very nice
we were delighted to have both an exceptional waiter and menu
i am pretty sure that almost everyone said hello to us which was really nice
the setup is much like dutch bros coffee on the eastside where you have two options on how to order walkup or drivethru
lets start with the location
i love the atmosphere here
its about 5 miles away
food pricy  the provide you with a house made chili oil hotsauce which makes you want to drink
great location too super close to the light rail so you can have that extra sake bomb
second my friend has a food allergy and asked for egg whites he said absolutely not the kitchen was too backed up and the restaurant wasnt even full
am i at a place in my life where such a statement rings true
for dinner i ordered the sea bass special my husband ordered the fettuccine tocco and my 2yearold had the childrens pasta with marinara sauce which she loved
no soap or paper towels
8 vanilla ice cream we got it for free by checking in to facebook
dd i did have one drink in me but i had a great time dancing with my friends
we also ordered the brownie with ice cream and peanut butter caramel which was the only the item we with which we were slightly disappointed because it was dry and apparently flavored with one of the beer stouts
check food overall great
the alfredo was really really standard and nothing i couldnt get from a grocery store and in both entrees there was a ridiculous amount of onion
the service was overall good
i went here with a couple of friends and their sangria is to die for
we also had the white shrimp from the raw bar
burgers were large flavorsome and there were a lot of interesting options
for dinner i has the vigazz burger with fried egg and she had the black bean burger
these are obviously the foundation of a good experience and is the basis of our many historical visits to ocean club and mastros
every time i come in this beck of the woods and drive by i was always wanting to stop but never have
not a fan of the rice so i ate the salad on the side while my friend ate the rice haha
my favorite parts the scene great views of the falls really nice outdoor bar and seating area weather permitting and love the village area
the steak was cooked perfectly and rubbed with an awesome blend of spices that added a mountain of bold flavors especially with the j1 sauce
i must have been in right after the managers read the review about their  inconsistent policies
the sauce was rich buttery creamy flavorful zesty delicious
you dont find that at enough places these days
i can honestly say while a simple burger the wisconsin burger delivered by old fashioned meets my expectations for a good burger
we spoke to the manager a bit about the restaurant and he was kind enough to comp the beer
now they only have a store bought bag of chips
i ordered through uber and my friends thought i was being scammed
if you want to spend a nice afternoon watching the footy al fresco this is the place to be
all these for 50
i got 2 words for you
it was cooked perfectly super moist with the flavorful skin still on
the staff was very personal and enjoyable
i really needed the ketchup not because i needed more flavor but to use the taste to balance the saltiness
it was probably one of the better desserts ive eaten in vegas
naturally we ate there for dinner on the first nighti was shocked by the service and quality of the food in all the best ways
the place is a gold mine in a quiet part of town
the vanilla latte with vanilla vodka was also amazing
food was good as always
monday and tuesday are their wing nights
i used to live right by this 4peaks and thus was a frequent visitor
the music is is great but way too too loud
a lot of unusualfreaky people
edit after the response of the restaurants manager first it is good to know that management is reading these reviews and responding
my husband got a few traditional and special rolls and wasnt a huge fan adding to the 4 star rating
if i were a more avid gamer would come back with friends and give it another shot but im not so yeah
i would definitely recommend using the prix fixe option
i enjoying lunching with clients here and i enjoy coming by later on for cocktails or chambord margs and appetizers
wine list  5  the wine list was the size of my dads old law books the bigger ones
i think the waiter was trying to be helpful but he was condescending throughout the multiple interactions we had
had a terrible experience here
but you cant falter on the main
my beer came to about 7 bucks more than i normally pay for even a sixpack but the beer was tasty and it was in the airport
well done martini
hopefully you will as well
drink it out of a bottle and shut up
anyway my man and i finally tried the original hamburger works
theres two main areas the lounge area with the live band and the outside patio area with the dj bar and the view
she was good
i have tried multiple burger bars and counters and nothing outshines rehab
great vibe just wished the food stood up a little better  particularly given the price
i watched them work their rounds and check on these guys up at the table tops but never bothered to check if we may have wanted a drink
we had a rare steak and and a well done steak on our order and both were perfect
my first dinner here chefs board artichokes marinated olives italian salami parma prosciutto fontina  fresh buffalo mozzarella 12 zin braised short ribs asiago  spinach gnocchi 20 the chefs board is huge
yesterday i enjoyed the scarlet salad and added strawberries instead of cranraisins i love fresh fruit in a salad
either makes their own soy or adapts existing soy to their liking
for the chicken and waffles try taking plain chicken breast and crust it with plain corn flakes cereal
top notch service
beds are comfy
what you can expect from guu izakaya authentic japanese run by actual japanese owners are tapasstyle plates that are aggressively priced
my husband sent his back  we all ate what was served didnt want to wait a half hour later no burger ever arrived for my husband
this is an amazing restaurant with some delicious food
surprisingly we didnt break the bank  their alcohol is average priced
maybe theres one good cook and one bad cook
the food is ok but nobody comes for the food except possibly to eat the chocolate stratosphere dessert a molded chocolate replica of the tower where youre eating which was kitschy cool
the wednesday oyster night is a good value 12 for 12 and they come with 7 different sauces ranging from coffee to korean tabasco
i actually really do like patties
the sushi was just bland tasting
but no need to go back either
its a new restaurant so there are more space to progress
we went for lunch and wont go back
the place is not much to look at but it is a whole lot of fun
as for the bar itself id call it a small bar
i had the berry berry bramble
however if you want to avoid the loo you might also want to avoid the food
this is a really cool place to hang for a glass of wine and some decent pubgrub
the bar area was nice but ill have to come back for that  just got a chai tea latte to go
they took forever to even get an order
however i will warn youit a big portion can easily feed 2 people
one glass of sangria 17
just disappointed in the lack of freshness of the salad
is it like an americanizedvegaszised irish pup
bianca pizza  cool presentation served with scissors on the board but taste was meh
along with the sushi we also ordered the prime rib and baked lobster
finally then we got the menu
knowing it was graduation night and seeing a big party come in after us i was willing to cut them some slack
that bothered me and the flavors just didnt work for me either
the budlight girl who witnessed the dis went and got me the mayonnaise i requested when i placed the order
my response was that is not a good answer
some friends and i came here last night for winterlicious and although the food was mostly good the overall experience left me feeling a little bit disappointed
almond tofu  dude
the atmosphere is fantastic as is the view
i believe that the food here is a little overpriced from what i sampled but definitely come here to get the delicious drinks and enjoy this very classy and beautifully decorated bar
our bartender i think his name was terry cant remember due to being at bills earlier enjoy the 99 cent margaritas lol but i will tell you this he made a hell of a mojito
and who can complain about the fried egg i added
you should come and try it
for mexican food id go somewhere else
the place is small so expect a wait when its busy
chase that down with some awesome margaritas and what could be better
always very greasy and oily even when you request very little oil
great food and awesome service
lollipop was good spicy
now this with some sake and sapporo makes a fine meal
the drink menu is extensive and just about everything is great i would know because we all swapped drinks and tried each others
salad bar is pretty decent
the shared topos appetizer was a great start to a delicious dinner
they have a huge variety of items which really surprised me
wasnt sure what to expect but wow is all i can say
we had their big salad and had plenty to share between the two of us
sure its a little pretentious and twee but i still dug it enough to say id come back
the all you can eat has very little limitations if any at all
service is good
ambience is okay
overall experience at this property was great
but our experience was mixed
they also have a poetry open mic live music a dj and a bunch of other stuff
it was a different world for me but it was definitely an experience
although my allergy is not that severe it was nice that the restaurant took the precautions for me
then i noticed ziggys was attached
so when i called the next day to ask for this to be fixed i didnt think it would be too much trouble to have the amount adjusted or at least the promise of a free drink at the next show
we had the chicken lettuce wraps turkey burger and monte que
great guacamole and salsa
i know they were really busy but i get really upset when they act like we dont deserve to be there
something inside each person is the desire to try something new
thank you james for making this experience especially wonderful
basic institutional fare the french toast was dry there was some warm syrup you could add scrambled eggs in big cakes of egg selection of pastriesmuffins very minimal eg two kinds of danish no toast no english muffins no cereal hot or cold no pancakes no waffles few bagel toppings
now its crowded as hell and they have a great happy hour that many poepel know abouot so you have to deal with that
food was okay but nothing to write home about
the service we received were great
bartender shrugged and said she heard me wrong not sure how that works but okay
my  friend ordered a plate of scrambled eggs with cheese on them hash browns sausage 2 links bacon 2 strips and toast
i tried to keep the experience within a small circle however no response means we dont care which is exactly what happened when we tried to have dinner at this establishment
this was our last attempt and they ended up liking luna enough to come back twice
the waitress who had us was pleasant but overwhelmed clearly
not happy at all
the mole taco was spot on as well as the especial
we left hungry bummed and wont be visiting again
you can have the samples of different kind of beers
i will come here again when i am back in vegas
now add in the elegant and luxurious ambience at jasmine sitting next to the bellagio fountains and the price isnt so bad
and then i saw fez
my friends got the snow ocean crab salad and chirashi
le spicy special vaut la peine pour le got malgr que les makis soient un peu petit
dont forget the milkshakesmmmmm
the dj isnt so bad i enjoy that they play a mix of current music and 90s rap
i found out about this place through a buddy of mine
this is a really great restaurant
i have been frequenting this restaurant for about 5 years now since my employer moved to fort mill
id highly recommend checking it out at least once
im a huge fan of what theyre known for macaron ice cream sandwiches
in terms of service our server was so nice the owner personally visited our table and delivered our food and the back patio was spacious
everything we had was delicious and i highly reccomend it all sangria pitcherpeach and basil but with the wide variety im sure the others are good too kale cauliflower salad salt cod croquetas jamon wrapped dates the paella de tapagria order this when you arrive it takes about 30 mins and omg you have to save room for dessert  that spanish toast is heavenly
i felt like i was cockblocking someone
came here after reading reviews on the place on yelp
we had a group of 10 every where we went in vegas to eat when that happens everyone charges you 20 for tip and then gives you poor service
httpswwwfacebookcomtheoriginalchoppedsalad pork belly pastrami rye spaetzle brussels sprout sauerkraut mustard jus  the pork belly was melt in your mouth although some offputting parts were all fat
wall to wall tv screens showing every type of sport you could imagine
the crowd here now seems much more chill and far less in crowd
artichoke and black truffle soup is a must must have
after we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer
and how can you not love a bar that has something called ass juice on the menu
i had the french philly sandwhich and it was awesome
a cashier in the back cashed in all the nickels the machine gives you when you cash out
stopped in for lunch on valentine day just to get out out of the brutal cold for awhile
i ordered my go to drink hot green tea matcha latte with 50 sugar
that was aight but then again by this point i was wasted lol
she did a great job recomending what we should try and getting us our meals in a timely manner
the service was impeccable
the vigs getting upped to 5 stars
wir waren zum wiederholten male im joe penas zum essen
if youre going to complain then get the fuck out of here
keep in mind that she and i could be considered to be beer snobs crossed with beer adventurists
love the renovation
the sushi is fantastic and at a great price buy 1 get 1 rolls everyday of the week
i have yet to be disappointed by any of the cocktails i have tried here
con theyre the big tables not the regular barsize tables that are easier and more fun to play on
sheppards pie was bland and bangers and mash was tiny
the menu is small but the food that we got was yummo
overall it was a good experience and i would go back again but i might try something different next time maybe a spicier burger
i love chilis but the service at this location was a bad experience
ein trauriges blttchen salat war drauf 3 winzige zwiebelringe sowie eine scheibe scheiblettenkse
everyone enjoyed their food as we all ordered various items from the menu
thanks bar isabel i get it
get here early or make sure you have a reservation
we skipped the appetizer because we didnt want to fill up before our steaks came
i absolutly love this place
ive been to this restaurant at least 10 times in the last few years
after a half hour of watching every party larger than two being seating and served in the room our waiter finally got around to taking our order and mind you our drinks are now empty and he never asked if we wanted another round just do you know what entrees youd like
i usually skip even trying the craft beer lights because they usually are so watered down and lack taste
close to a metro station and very easy access
despite there being a crowd service did not suffer and our waiter was quick and attentive
the hummus is nice and creamy with a double hint of gaaarlic
my vegan sandwich um i think it was vegan was excellent
it tastes like they mix the tap lines with different beers or dont clean the lines properly
we decided wed share the lobster carbonara
there are two floors
the food was very good though
my second visit to bjs desert ridge was yesterday
i was pleased to discover these items on this new menu and really appreciated the crispiness of the katsu chicken
3 now to the food the mussels were amazingly good  must have the pork belly was good but i wouldnt order it again  the gnocchi was seriously heavenlyorder this
justin at the upper bar is very attentive too
of course at this point i wanted a quiet easy night but i couldnt have been more pleasantly disappointed
we also loved sitting on the dog friendly patio overlooking south mountain
fans of white zombie beer by catawba brewing co will be glad to hear that both locations keep this yumminess on tap
would recommend if youre looking for great sushi in this area
this is the desert so its just super lame hence the deduction of one star
the server made an acceptable effort but was clearly overloaded
the server was nice but totally overwhelmed with just three tables to serve
they force you to check in your coat right at the door
also there are vegetarian options which is awesome for our family
more like a middleeastern kabob than an eastern european sausage
not a single thing for kidsteens to eat
when we entered the restaurant the door man didnt greet us with a hello or a welcome but a quick do you have a reservation tonight
very cozy little wine bar
food was excellent and all wait staff were absolutely lovely
the server was somewhat alright
i decided to try the matcha style boba tea which was pretty good
wish i could have reviewed the food
we went before the garth concert
place was empty even after all the renovations
definitely recommend this dish if you love japanese curry
the sauce was flavourful and the green papaya was shredded as you would expect
edible and sanitary but thats it
its a private club so you need a membership to play there
im giving this a 4 because it really is better than the other allyoucaneat sushi places nearby
definitely try the sashimi options yellowtail salmon and scallop were delicious
what a nice surprise
ok i did not go off on this young man i did point out that as a server look at what the guest is complaining about before you come back with any kind of excuse
while dessert was tempting i was sated so i called it a night and rolled myself home
they do not take reservations and the tables probably seat a max of 56 people so this is not a place to take your 12 friends for a birthday party
chef travis has done an excellent job with the food
we were walking along the vegas strip all day and didnt realize how hungry we were until we sat down
i had a great morning and experience too
we will be back
i really like the crispy steak tacos and the humus
i was hoping for some more adventurous recommendations but she went with the typical popular dishes
a definite go to spot
i cant get over how fresh everything was
and holy cow i cant remember the last time i wasnt able to finish a burger
i enjoy cheese as much as the next guy but not when its used to bludgeon your taste buds into submission rather than as a complement to a wellflavored dish
we also shared a side of duck fat fries 4
food is totally worth it
we spent about 2550 before tip for 2 burritos 2 drinks and a side order of taro chips with cheese
we sat for the time being at a communal table and asked to be seated at a different table when one became available
so we just decided to order them all at once and he could space them out for us as he had said
i dont understand why they have a dj but im glad he has a regular gig
we still had our drinks from the bar and so she deduced we were not going to want wine with our dinner even though we told her we were
good place to hit up if you have never been
not even a bowl of ice cream sufficed
your a college student working in a bar for tips
i should have paid closer attention to the 3 star rating on yelp
in order of my favorites marinated artichoke smoked salmon traditional and caprese
then i had the soup and salad nothing to rave about its soup and salad but the soup was very good and she had the ahi tuna tacos which she raved about
ask for kirstin when you go there
the owner came by every table to make sure everything was perfect
i think they take some slack for the outfits but they were still very kind
i tried the oyster shooter before but i just personally didnt like it
the vibe is trendy and cute and european looking
finally we briefly mentioned that we were getting married in several months
huge resentment and so frustrated im not sure i can enjoy my food at this point
because that is pretty much what this place is a place to watch the football with your mates while having a pint and something to eat
nonetheless im grateful that a pub delivered nearby and had their kitchen open late
i love their fish tacos
this made for a fun time for our group of 5 yelpers
we were looking for a good steakhouse while on vacay in vegas and since we had never been to cut we decided to check it out being that its highly rated
not to mention every time i do try and cook i cant get my turkey to be anything but dry
short and soggy
my perspective is from diehard ny giants fan and all around bar fan
fried pickles were absolutely amazing
my boyfriend got the fish with fries in that same miniature bowl
all 3 girls walked slowly around the stage and didnt do much dancing let alone stripping
also the bar tender doesnt know to not drown your single malt with ice so make sure you specify
3 bottles of alcohol made us all satisfied
finally they have a bar inside the venue so we were glad for the arizona stronghold rose  cocktails
the service and food was wonderful
the worst part is that he was chatting with the gentleman i assume the owner who is always standing at the bar and as we got up to leave he gave me an epic stare up and down
but be very prepared to wait in line for an hour or two in busy nights they can o let seat 16 at a time
love love love this place
i ordered the crab and shrimp cakes
i have a feeling it was because we had allyoucandrink wristbands but it doesnt matter
of course you could find all your sbit cheeper online but without the knowledge base your money is wasted
it was as if they unloaded a farm delivery truck that morning
this place isnt super fancy or new like any of the newer gastropub restaurants being built in the other parts of the city
ordered the mongolian chicken and received beef they fixed it extremely fast
brown dragon was bomb and the sushi 21 too
what i like about this place is they make it so easy to pick the healthy side of the menu because it tastes sooooo dang good
i got the salad with ginger dressing as a starter and it was awesome
overall it is decent place to get a drink and bite to eat
ended the night with karaoke and soj  from what i rememberwe all had a great time
classic pub in the heart of the monkland village
definitely check it out
the place was packed with people waiting
corey if you are reading this you deserve a raise
i was thrilled when it arrived and it was very little cheese with a huge mound of grilled fresh veggiessuper fresh healthy and delish
double u more like double the regrettable decisions u will make in a night
we also ordered mad mule 10 which was served at the yelp event  a cinnamon apple sour 7
the only thing i dont like so much about this place is the prices
well my food was good i had the veggie dilla
which might be a good business plan if you have really awesome steaks but the steak wasnt awesome
the grill cheese was a hit for me as well
las vegas has sushi places everywhere but this was the best weve ever had
gorgeous fixtures and i love the privacy of two of the dining rooms
3rd even though the food was excellent it was way over priced paying for extras like fried rice was a little ridiculous
heavy on lagers quite a number of ipas lots of wheats and 3 or 4 stouts  porters
and i loved it
friday night10 cover you walk around the corner from behind the curtain at the front and theres literally like ten people in the whole place
the food is overpriced and not good
dinner meals are 50 which includes the salad bar
other apps were equally well prepared a quennelle of chicken liver pate salumi a bite of cured sardines
and hes not even finish with it yet the silver color comes next week had to bleach my pure black hair
they make their own beer and its lovely
you are allowed to sit outside as well  as the band is outside immediately by the front door area
i have been coming here for years and have always had great service my water coffee and juice always refilled and my check handed to me at an appropriate time
my husband and i went there tonight after the diamondbacks game
he was friendly and fun but didnt go overboard
this month july kazbar has 12priced arizona wines every thursday with live jazz
the guy cooking doesnt have the biggest kitchen to work with but is pumping out some fantastic food
i may or may not do this depending on how my exams go
i cannot wait for the day his business shuts down and we have all bet money on the month that it does its just a matter of time
wont be going back
danelle was our server and she was friendly and fun to talk to
overall  i didnt enjoy the food
i just wanted to make sure i had a good backdrop of the bar for my selfie and it worked
for 14 there are way better pizza options out there
it felt like chinese stir fried chicken bits
the wifi connection was easy to pick up
it was still pleasant because we were just chilling
went there last night
there is one section i particularly like for watching games is in the northeast corner there is 2 flat panels on one wall and 2 on another and 2 large boothbar chairs to fit 68 people comfortably
best filet ive had not saying much since i havent had much hahaha  doublecut colorado lamb chops w mint chimichurri 5795  this is what my friend ordered
the meat was practically falling off the bones
the wait is over on the east bank of the flats
im more of a regular martini guy but it never hurts to try something new
service was superbly slow  there were 2 women working the bar area and there were periods of time 5 minutes when they were both missing when they returned they carried that lovely trail of cigarette smoke with them  you couldnt take smoke breaks apart
price average for downtown and the area
they were both very good
this place is as cool as it gets in charlotte nc
i remember the first time we went i couldnt eat as much pan roast as i wanted
mine was served bloody and his was served well done
food is stellar and so is the service
the food is hit or miss
it has so much flavourand they do it so well
the atmosphere is great ping pong corn hole pool table darts and music all make for a great time
worth the price
its so cute
even though their desserts are a miss to me i love their drinks and will always come back for them
the servers are fast and attentive
i liked the cozy atmosphere in the old pub but this is way nicer
the noise level was a little loud but that was due to the fact that it was totally packed
was invited to this restaurant a couple days ago for a birthday party and the place was very clean and had really comfortable seating
i think the manager apologized 13 times
i want to rub my face in all of their dishes even if it goes up my nostril
the food is decent enough to get you through the night
not only was the service excellent but the food was prepared in a timely fashion and very good
really love the decor and outdoor porch here
being in the restaurant business for 10 years im never coming back
hot tip order a paloma to drink
i started coming here when i began working in the same office park
love the new menu you gotta try the wings
they charged us 12 extra for the rice anyway
im just thinking ahead but not from personal experience yet
my chicken hash was full of those bits of chewy cartilagelike chicken that you would ya know throw away
their tuna rolls were tasy but could have a little better assembled
now your server is pointing and squinting at the tacos trying to discern which flavor is which
the sweet potato fries were awesome hard to mess that up
you should visit the place just to receive their great service
but it was yum
fifteen minutes later our burgers arrived
we were told we could sit anywhere so after examining the menu we started out with a few brews and ordered our food a few minutes later
der fisch ist gut wenn auch nicht berragend
we ate inside that morning and the service was very good
the baby gets his own sling
under 10 for a sandwich  a smoothie you also get a side which i think its a real bargain considering the freshness of the food
there is a bit of phx douchebagginess that is very very different than scottsdale douchbachery but overall the place is rad
overall we enjoyed our experience  coffee
i was actually pretty disappointed with the meal as prices have inched up and meal quality has gone down
overall if i didnt live so far from it id go back for the hour
we ordered drinks from the bar i got a pomegranate mojito the bf got a simple gintonic
the restaurant is conveniently located near st davids and there are tons of parking in the parking lot
we were still charged a resort fee even though the pool was under construction and the place is old and dirty  where is the resort
went here for lunch and ordered the sriracha chicken wrap with brussel hash
what i liked most was the size of the rustic tables they are much bigger than normal tables you dont feel cramped
i have been here for lunch
this place is great
the shrimp which came with an amazing garlic pepper sauce was so good and tender
after reading multiple yelp reviews on various italian restaurants i decided on stone and vine
for the price id pass
visited tyber creek on st pattys day with some friends and had an awesome time
the girl at the counter happily took my order and the chef nodded in approval when i told him everything was amazing
my 10 year old daughter has been eating there with us for years and he always gives her a kit kat bar and chicklets
i had to ask them to cover up the mess which they were not going to do
she knew we loved buffalo sauce and brought a side to dip with our house made kettle chips
petit bar de quartier le reposado est rserv aux amateurs de tequila la carte est tout simplement immense et vous pouvez commander vos shots  lunit ou bien par series de 5 pour une sance de dgustation
pizza comes out fast too
however i can see where other yelpers commented on the slow service there was some wait times for our next courses
but there was only 78 tables full on this wednesday night and not that much of a workload on the servers as i could see
they were having a ton of fun
die qualitt von essen ist grundstzlich gut
there are far better options for a beer in the strip like rolands and even bella notte
dessert however was phenomenal
no problem the pub simply stole money by writing themselves a larger tip on my credit card receipt
my highlight is the mens bathroom where they actually put a puppetgraveyard behind the urinals
vlad and junior did a great job of fitting them in giving them great cuts and making them feel very comfortable throughout the entire experience
when the check came we noticed that we werent charged for the sodas we ordered
i could barely taste the rum in my drink
so she did discount the calamari 50 which was appreciated
my friend ordered the cal club with fries and enjoyed it too especially the roll
when i picked up my unbeetable smoothie thats really what its called i didnt coin that pun for lunch last week i was pleased with the service and speed of the staff  there
staff is friendly and restaurant is very clean
the sushi was above average and very fresh and can stand on its own
waited about 5 minutes to be seated which was great with the christmas market in full swing
others in my party ordered the goat cheese raviolis and the beef tenderloin
the only thing i didnt like that i have ordered there is the ramen bowl
im going to have to go back every time im in vegas
the lasagne had very little sauce and was stone cold and flavorless
service was exceptional
build your own order a great pint and enjoy
anyone who has been harrassed by joe v of home plate for a bad review you can find him and confront him in person at the foxtail pool  sls his full name is joseph john valdez
it was my second time going to this small divey type barand i really love it
we live in south chandler and this place was a worth the drive
so we didnt go in
but the pork belly tacos and lamb lollipops were amazing
the food was decent for all you can eat
roaring fork is one of my favorite restaurants
what a hidden little gem we found
he ended up forgetting about it which i really didnt care about it and wasnt going to say anything
we had the ahi tuna tacos and they were good but small portion for hh
probably wont go back
after an early hot yoga session yesterday my friend and i stopped here at around 830 am because we were hungry
overall everything was pretty good
i asked our server about this and he explained that the restaurant ran out of their regular ginger and this was their back up
friendly staff and amazing prices
you will not be disappointed
overall it was the best experience of my trip so far and i cant wait to go back to try their freshmade mozzarella cheese
thats how you get people to stay and come back
we finally got a couch to sit on so we raced for it
i know this is a new location and they are extremely busy
there were out of a few styles when i went but they also werent your every day choices and could see limited quantities running out quickly
my dish included pulled pork which i found to be largely flavorless
service was great
while drinking my beer i noticed there was a book someone had that listed the beers available in bottles
the staff is always nice and friendly and the place was clean
i highly recommend the green chili burger w half fries  half onion rings
we waited forever for her to bring us water never gave us any refill to take our order bring our order bring the check and take out box
i am proud of the mojitos i make and had heard so much about this spot that i had try these
the restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries
i definitely appreciate a business that takes feedback even on yelp as a learningretraining opportunity and one that will correct a bad experience so ive upped my rating
there was a huge mess on the floor below our table where a family of 8 had all of their kids before us and no one thought to sweep under the table or wipe the chairs before sitting a new group
i am pleased that she by mortons participated in restaurant week and ill be returning to try some of their seafood offerings
i suggest to call in and place your order first so you dont have to wait as they get pretty busy for lunch time
thank you for the meal sushi way
the atmosphere is warm and inviting but fittingly trendy for the old towne area
cant wait to try their lions head as it also has bourbon
the broth the noodles the porky meat and toppings are exactly what i would expect out of a traditionalstandard ramen
this is a great place
may have issues with lube in the restaurant name
they all sound really fricking delish
update went back on my 24th bday 1221 and did just that
i was expecting the food to be okay and was pleasantly surprised
everything looked really great and the servers remembered he preferred his meat more well done so they made sure to circle back around to him for the end pieces
everyones glass was empty and needed refills
that is all
theyre always really nice and smiling
the place has lots of students from the nearby college
they are line priced with a regular bar but i thought they were well worth the price
and it has average seating area
i basically have to come back for everything
soft pretzels are a must
he said that the special is over at 2  i said thats not what this table flyer says and he claimed that our server should have told us it ended it at 2 and they are in the process of having new ones made
worst meal ever
the worst part is the service is always slow as can be
i went here with a friend because we had heard it recently opened
the patty was red
dishes well presented
i ordered the chile rellenos and they were delicious
arguably the best steak dinner i have ever had
they had so many good looking drinks i would love to try
i very much enjoyed the kokomo and the fizz
minus 4 bartender comes over and takes our order
what a great experience
i got a mojito and i was disappointed at first because it just tasted like sugary mint water
we were visiting vegas and decided to go off the strip for some local flavor
this is a notorious spot for cocaine transactions hence the sceney aspect
its a bit of a trek from my usual hang out spots
all in all id go back next time im on the strip
5 min without any greeting from anyone
the waitress didnt even know what one of the drinks wasthere are only six drinksand five everyone knows margarita mimosa mojito blood mary sangria
my lunch buddy and i came here craving oysters and they where closed
i took maybe three bites just to have something in my stomach before i went back to work
3 stars for a cute location and decent price
my pasta was decent which i ate and requested seconds which is allowed for the trio because they give you very small portions however seconds never came
i would even say the best in the city as i try new wings any place i go
you travel up a private dedicated elevator 100some feet above the strip to the restaurant
on my walk over to the fitzgerald i experienced the experience
awesome sushi and great service
thank you jamie for making this restaurant a fun experience not just a place to eat
food and service is great
service was slow and unorganized
they have a great beer selection on tap and drink specials
i went here one day last year cuz the sbs drive through line was to long
my wife had the mixed grill which has lamb beef and chicken on skewers
find ich gut
had some sushi in the desert this past weekend
we continue to chat and anticipate our food
this place was phenomenal
bartenders where chicks in underwear we are going to fix it
everything ive had here has been delicious though
as of this writing they have a karaoke and trivia night along with football games sunday  monday
they also have drag shows which are a great experience
well worth it
after a few hours of fun and games we left
when i asked the bartender what they made the drink with because it clearly wasnt cherry juice he said oh just this fruity stuff its good
white table cloths and candles on every table
what do you use to cut the apple
unfortunately the onion lover received the salad that had no onions it
i highly recommend going during happy hour if you want reasonable prices
their signature drinks arent part of the happy hour deal so we ended up paying regular price
ill come back every time
when i went to go pick up my order i stood at the bar for 5 min until i was greeted
if youre new to the club scene and want a hip hop club that radiates typical phoenix then this is for you but after youre 24 im sure you wont want to be here anymore lol
there was a large variety
i like to sit at the bar if possible
the waiter tried he just had no ability to converse with us
we will be back lots
friendly and knowledgable staff
the guys working were awesome and gave us a deal for it being our first time in
the garlic mashers were a little too garlicky but i dealt with it all day and going into the nextlol
bar food is average
an hour later we were seated
we cannot wait to come back for more
great bar food
she was very patient with us and really kept the food coming out while giving us our space
the description was of course filled with wine speak it has floral notes with a touch of leather yada yada
it was also packed with people cheering and yelling and slapping hifives to each other
their happy hour food
by the end of the night my mouth was tingly from the sodium overload
drinks were still pricey for happy hour though
the food is amazing you must try the brusslesprouts
as always the dish did not disappoint
it took awhile for someone to come over and take our drink orders but it was fine because the menu is pages and pages long so it took awhile for me to decide what i wanted
look no further my friends you have hit pay dirt
the timo benedict their signature eggs benedict is phenomenal
our waiter however must have disappeared again because he didnt return until 1045 and so we not only missed the 1030 but had to run to catch the 11pm train
i wont recommend this restaurant to anyone
they did let us order togo though
had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area
while i was eating he never once came to ask me how it was going or whether i wanted anything else
both ended up being excellent choices
so far our servers have been great
the bottom line
this place is packed during the big games and they get satellite feeds beyond espn and fox soccer channel
i brought company out of town guests over 10 people and they accommodated us nicely
however i ate at yellowfin after reading the reviews here on yelp and was not disappointed
our server was friendly and prompt
dont order off the menu
my son had the horchata and it was magical
i only stayed here because it was the designated lodging for a conference at the hotel
then we shared the french onion soup popovers
when my wife pointed out the beer floats she laughed
very good meal and great service
it was super sweet
we left with an experience that was far from memorable  actually wed like to forget it
nothing off kilter about this yard house
probably my favorite bar in charlotte
it took forever  because he made everyone a drink and until i made a stink with my waiterdid he make it
my dad and i split some garlic parmesean wings
best pizza around too
came here twice on my 4 day trip in town
mmmm yes please
in fact i dont think they even have any of the big boys brews i include keiths in that category  fyi
another fun event at four peaks brewing company
very good soups
decent draft specials
many different types of burgers to choose from
pretty expensive for a hookah place and you have to buy a drinkincluding water
no corkage charge either if you bought the bottle there and want to drink it now
like taking a bath in the ashes of a pack of marlboro
he will share one bite and i have to agreedeeeelicious
seahawk flags greet you outside as well as clever window displays
he is so stuck up
i could probably eat two or three dishes of it
cut rolls are 512
what gets irritating is he did not come back to our table for over ten minutes  not even to ask what we would like to drink
sushi is low quality and expensive
the waiter never did refill my water glass
we got a tour of the cellar talked about beer and the restaurant and really enjoyed his company
i have not visited this location but im impressed at the timely response i received
five stars plus
we started off with house salad and it had no dressing and no flavor
nothing special but gets the job done
the service was slow and they were not very busy
ive been here a few times and wanted to rate them for a while but i didnt have a yelp account yet
the rolls are sloppy and unappealing
love love love this place
also the other employees are very friendly and attentive of a customers need
main courses we all had were solid
im thru with kaya
the dinner menu at olives did have similarities to olives lunch offerings
the shop is cute enough though
huge burgers and good atmosphere
shortly afterwards the waiter who took our order came and instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding insisted that that he didnt bring us anything raw
similar to other comments a swiss chalet dinner would have tasted better
the arrogant butcher is always hit or miss for me
when i arrived i was greeted warmly and introduced to the manager michael damas
the filet mignon sliders and mac n cheese was outstanding
the only thing irish is they sell guinness
we practically had a to beg for another round of beers because no one bothered to come and ask again amateur hour
however after our drinks were delivered we got stuck with one server who was kind of an airhead
if youre a wine enthusiast the selection of wine at ferraros is one of the most notorious around
luckily our friendly waitress  the reason for the 3 stars replaced the drink with a margarita which was fine but nothing special
where are the hipsters tonight
the pasta wasade in house
we went there for a relatively early 630pm dinner on a friday so it wasnt too busy while we were there and was just picking up as we left
we got access here as part of a travel zoo deal with the simon restaurant at the palms
overthetop huge portions
the menu prices were high as well when taking into account the size of the sushi pieces and rolls
good service good atmosphere great beer
will definitely go back next time im in town
kristi is the most amazing person there and please ask for her
its kind of pricey
no kids meal was offered so my daughter and i shared
the food is great the service is terrific and the entertainment is spectacular
the food was okay but not the best considering where we were having dinner
i called and let the restaurant know of the mess up
im officialy a fan of sushi one
chat with the staff
that changed a couple of weeks past when i saw the gogos in the boston hob
figlio di puttana sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda
our last couple servers have been warmer and more professional than that earlier clown but i cant let go of a lingering disdain for this place  even though theyre good at what they do
however if you just like to have this sort of view while you eat you cant really go wrong
my favorite sushi sashimi chirashi rolls and everything place
showed up 15 minutes later
weve been here quite a few times and its always been great pizza
this is a young area embrace it and you would probably do better with that nice hunk of real estate
that was fine we arrived early anyways
she really liked it
the buffet selection is better than copacabana but the meat is not
the proportions were tiny for 13
the app was fine but the pizza didnt come out as ordered
music is decent
after waiting for about 6 minutes he finally came over shuffled through papers before asking for our name
my mother  i were at aria browsing around  decided to get a snack
you can only order one mochi per person
you better get the hell out of here
presentation of everything was exquisite
i found it as a double helix
this is an eclectic burger joint
in their hands hovering over you
my cuzn waited abt 20 mins for a side of spinach
their special mac and cheese with shallots and peas is awesome
i turn my head and theres midget porn
this has got to be one of the most confusing set up for any first timers coming in to check out the mi lounge which is all the way at the back of the pool hall through a set of conspicuous looking metal push doors
this corn tortillas stacked tower of gewwy cheese chicken and sauce was great and even better the next day since i took half home
this was my first time back since they started brewing their own beer and i was shocked that they didnt promote their brand better
the restaurant was very cold inside
wife and i are out to have dinner at n9ne at least annually and prior to summer 17 wed always have a fantastic meal at n9ne then head upstairs to ghost for some booze photos and incredible views of the strip at night
will be back
warning this is a tavern so they will not let you in past 5pm if you are under 21 unless you are children with your parents
i was already irritated so i just sat there waiting for my friend to arrive
but then again im not 19 the staff and music though are pretty great although cover is absolutely teeth grinding ridiculous
the second beer we selected and ordered was very bad very skunked
its so good here and the atmosphere just makes it better
never will i ever spend another dollar at nu sanctuary
she never asked how my food was or stopped by to ask for a drink refill
it was an awful experience and wont be going back
the selection of beers available is the main attraction here with 6 casks on tap and around 14 kegs what you will not get is any of your large mainstream industrialized beers ie
the food was mainly ceviche and fish based although there were bigger platters and samplers that ran the gamut between roasted potatoes and meat
what makes this place so great is its a place you can come in by yourself and leave with a few new friends
it was bad  dry seemed very homemade ie
the waiter left and came back and told us that actually he was wrong and the flight wines are all tap wines from a barrel made in tuscon
three of the cities hottest and sweetest bartenders
the whole experience made me feel like i was in the caribbean
i was hungry
finally our waiter showed up without drinks or food and told us that we had to be physically sitting at the bar to have the happy hour pricing
at the end of the night i closed my tab out and left
tips get the yellowtail taquitos and the sea bass anticucho
overall i recommend this place and i will definitely be returning and with my stamp card
they have the miller high life beer the champagne of beer which you dont see often
decent kids options and great homemade moonshine inspired cocktails
luckily they managed to sneak in a few great lakes bottles without anyone noticing thank this for one of the stars
its high up in the air drinks are really expensive and theres an element of skank at times
beautiful elegant decor pleasant wait staff and delicious food
chef choi made us some incredible dishes as part of the all you can eat special
but if you actually want a nice dinner please look elsewhere
the sahara location has our number
great food for the good pricethis is my togo place for sushi and sashimi from now on
this will be visited often
sometimes theyre really rudewhich kind of throws me off as they have so many celebrities on their wall of fame youd think theyd be good with customers anyways thank god their food is good
not your place if you are looking for high end sushi but definitely an everyday sushi place that offers a good selection
they even do weddings here and they are so easy to work with
to think a staff member dj hire or employee can do that to a customer and get away with it is unprofessional
its in a great part of the city and we enjoyed people watching while on the patio
the circular tiles throughout cause a doubletake as does the deep sink
other than that the menu is small and too expensive so get a caipirinha one of the only good ones in town and enjoy a nice mellow night out
the chicken was not seasoned  flavorless and full of connective tissue no wonder the bartender never bothered to ask me how everything was but only served a few fries  definitely not enough  ketchup bottle was sticky and empty
burgers are excellent especially for las vegas
the service however is a major detractor and in my opinion is the most important part of any good dining experience
when we travel finding a health store is a priority for my wife
we have found a few great places in california and many times wished someone would open a place in vegas that will make some great fresh organic juice at a decent price
my teenagers and i just love this place
service servers are very hot import model look alikes
we live in chandler so its a bummer we dont have one but we do that santan brewery which is under same ownership and also quite good so next time well probably hit the tempe location
the german speaking boyfriend recommended i try the brat and sauerkraut yes
good cocktails and nice selection or beer
during lunch hour they were all playing cp24 but that mightve just been because there was nothing else to watch
i received four delicious amplesized blintzes with a side of fruit compote
but happy dog tots
server was kind enough to refund the burger and replace it with another option
our waiter never came to our table after taking our order so we had to flag another waiter down to get our bill
service was good though sorry but we will never return here
there were about 30 taps but the beers were heavy on belgians
are you kidding me
the music is good and just loud enough so you can have a private conversation at your table without anyone else overhearing it even though the tables are close
if i hadnt known i ordered a sloppy joe i would have thought i was eating some big mush gravy fries burger
this is not a cheap bar but its not ohsouptight either
the people that work here are so sincere and great at what they do
ive only ever ordered a select few cocktails here the moscow mule being my all time favorite
i love their pizza
handsome staff lol delicious food patient with big parties delicious italian food
anyways i ordered a pound of the homerun and the batman wings to share with a friend
it took her a second to figure out that were just a bunch of mimosa drinking fools and she did her part to keep the refreshing bubblies coming
we shared a hamburger and wings
what great timing and oh so delicious
this version was a bit fishier but still good nonetheless
they sing they dance they look at you lasciviously even though they dont mean it in short its everything you look for in a sports bar
happy hour is a great deal on food as well
pizza was good burger and fries were just okay
hint its the former
the sandwich was just okay
pizza was good but everything else lacked
2800 for a lunch like this was not fit for a pig
however she came back to check on us and started to take our bowls away while we were still eating
secondly its pricey so if anything is not to someones personal liking they are more upset due to the price
i recently had an unpleasant dining experience at bsbr
we came to the loose moose got seated and then found out they dont have pitchers
reminds me of south beach in many ways
not sure why theres so many negative reviews on here
no radical departures from any other brunch menu but its wellproportioned very well prepared and reasonably priced
and the reason is this  serving size
so he took the order back along with my two extra piece my leftover i didnt want he rather end biz n pissed off their customer over 4 cali rollreally
went in with a friend and we each put a 20 in the machine and both had 2 drinks
had a groupon so decided to try it
our waitress although very friendly was not helpful as she was not very knowledgeable about the menu
the chicken tacos are the best ive ever had so that is my staple when i go there
the beers are slightly on the pricey side for whats on offer
late night menu was so delicious
the gyoza especially was not that great
salsa bar lived up  exceeded reviews as the well decorated  tasty horchata
its not easy to find and once entered the guy lounging behind the door playing on his phone checking ids was a little weird not professional at all
one of the best sushi i had in a while
so other than that odd down fall that shatters my ocd like it was dipped in liquid nitrogen and smashed with a hammer i was impressed by this place
our most favorite waitress ever works here  ask for kamie
we arent in a tax bracket which allows us to splurge like this all the time but i would much rather pay more for a superior experience than less for mediocrity
it was some sort of powdered one
grab an ubertaxi to spring mt rd and get a taste of the real stuff
they serve cocktails but for once we didnt partake
the service wasnt great i mean the host who couldnt have been over 20 seemed to be the most chipper person in the place
all food items prepared correctly for everyone the first time
nice pub and comfy atmosphere
i must admit our waiter was correct that 23 tacos a piece is sufficient for a meal
they also have homemade coffeeinfused vodka which they use in the white russians
the quality of the fish is soso and the portions arent really all that great
most of the time it has been excellent
i love sushi and this place was recommended by staff in the mgm
you cannot go wrong with this place
i am not usually a fan of creamy sauces but i make the exception here
accessible and easy to understand the list has something for even the most intimidated wine novice
merci pullman
anyway our waiter and busboy were both very pleasant and helpful
the fish tasted fresh in all three
it was a last minute reservation and we had never seen the hotel before
come here for the chinese food not the hibachi
tacos are calling
jadore cet endroit
had a nice spice to it
only negative was the fish fry could have had a larger serving of fish
the staff is totally approachable and knowledgable as well
i even availed of a free tuna fish taco yelp promo and it was fantastic
a few knitpicky things can be added but are not important at all
when visiting in the area the front desk agent at our hotel recommended erins snug for a good dinner
love going to this spot in leslieville
i did give them a shot but never going back
honestly came here and reasonably occupied for a wednesday night
i enjoyed the meal
live music is great a new menu is figuring its way out and a huge tap list is a very welcome addition
meat cheese chocolate wine craft beer
stopped in on a weekday afternoon
the service was pretty awful
great beer and food
joe beef lite
be sure to order an extremely affordable beer 450 draught everyday
havent tried the food here  just the booze  good location good times
since all they had were meat dishes i did order steak well done
heist was now 2 for 2 we walked into heist and came to the sudden realization that we were officially the oldest people there im 40
so i was excited to go out tonight for taco tuesday and we chose the charlotte restaurant instead of the denver location because we were closer to it
i did not have a chance to eat here but i am looking forward to take a bite of the menu when i come next time to az
i have ordered take out a couple times with no problems but this dine in experience was awful
he offered his card to see if he could make our future dining experience more acceptable  when we got the cheque it was for the full amount
he wouldnt tell me his name or who he worked for
were glad we took that dessert though because that banana foster was to die for
the staff was so friendly food was like i was back in farmington at my friends grams house and the margaritas were fabulous
i came with a group of about 7 so you could probably understand that wed pick like 20 games we want to try and stack them on our table like true hoggers as we will stay here until we finish all those games
we ordered gyoza which was ok its pan fried instead of deep fried so its not very crunchy
in fact i think i would love going to any place that was written up as having one of the best sandwiches in charlotte but this one really comes through
service is excellent
horrific bar service
cooked to perfection and served in style
its so nice to have an option with upscale food so close to home on the west side
overall food 355 price  i think at 30 tip  is expensive for toronto
we always bring family and friends with us and they all love it
met a lot of really great people here each time that i come
pretty much all the servers and the manager talked with us as we were sitting there for a long time enjoying chatting all were very warm and engaging
as expected they were all yummy
to me this is expensive
look at all that cool different stuff on the ad on the table do you have that stuff
i dont want to feel like im one of three people dancing on a table but i dont want to be in a sea of people either
warning  do not order food here you will be disappointed
the miso soup is to die for
the beer selection is pretty good
if i am in the mood for brats i usually get the double
that was exceptional
the smores cookies is my favorite
went to try the silver menu and they raised the price to 17
fast service and they give large portions
for all of these reasons i will continue to show here for an early dinner on occasion
we ordered a red pie with mushroom jalapenos and pepperoni and a garlic sauce
all that room and no where to sit
most of the 2 star review is for the food anyway
the other bar food looked really good as well
incredibly slow service at this place
one thing ill admit that is extreme is prices for bottle service
we stopped in one evening for takeout and enjoyed the chicken panang and garlic beef and brocolli with sides of brown and white rice
i definitely recommend this place
menu has limited selection
the calamari came with few nuts but the strips of squid were cooked perfectly and the very creamy and soothing yuzu aioli with its slightly citrus flavor ameliorated much of the spiciness of the dish
the baja fish taco is my favorite
fish dont really impress me til i had this sea bass
located right opposite the pickney garage   so it was very convenient to get to
did the hostess just tell me 15 hr wait
there are also fullsize shuffleboards located indoors and outside
this time when we walked in there was four people at the host station and not one of them acknowledged us
the dolsot bibimbap was amazing
i rarely take a doggie bag but i brought the rest of the steak home for lunch tomorrow
i loved the pita sandwiches my favorite was the greek and the salads are unbelievable
well i ate it and i got sick
other items i ordered included samba juice raspberry and watermelon infused rum aai passionfruit crme de banana guava rainbow dragon roll eel red bell pepper cucumber mango avocado salt n pepper squid appetizer
its like eating ocean water and not in a good way
i love it when someone not only listens but engages on the topic with knowledge
dj strobe is extremely good at keeping the crowd entertained and is one of the best djs ive seen for electrohouse music
i tried the hot wings style hot
however i have no fear of vegan pancake batter and proceeded to shove the entire thing in my mouth anyway
i would say no stars
however without any comment on the mediocre service the owner came and apologized and brought us all free drinks
the downside is that its not as unique as other pubs might be
its a must when visiting
while this stuff is good its not unlike what you might eat at a good thai restaurant in seattle or san francisco or new york
there are a lot of tables that have a great view that overlooks the rogers center
2 potato balls for 6
we went here on a sunday with a groupon
i am a thai food aficionado and have experienced some amazing thai cuisine in atlanta and houston
their cocktails are on point i remember being very pleasantly surprised
and they have the nerve to charge you regular price for it
food was above average as was drink selection
except for the bar and sushi bar most seats have a clear overlooking the garden wwaterfall and beautiful flowers and treestheres even a table outside probably for special reservations or lunch
no worries though because sls is very small so its not a long walk at all
the caramelized onions were kind of tasteless
only one person working on a saturday
we never had an empty water glass and never felt rushed
for the side dish i had to try the mac n cheese
i was just a bit let down as i expected a bit more bang from this place
wish they had a glutenfree menu and more options
maybe spending the past four years in dallas has permanently skewed my view of how good tacos should taste and cost but im honestly just confused as to why my dinner experience was in such contrast to yelps consensus
on one occasion i had the focaccia clubhouse sandwich and it was very good
not that it matters past the disgust of our drink orders but service was extremely terrible as well
she should have ordered something that said rick moonen in front of it because the cioppino was excellent and recommended as a fan of seafood
my boyfriend and i always say we were going to try this place and its always packed and can never find parking lol
loved the service food and location
oh and the broccoli side dish too
hello downtown sushi favorite
this location is in the boulevard mall
ended up here instead of entering the game and saved a ton of money
culinary dropout is one of those places that just doesnt live up to the expectations that it sets
first of all do not order full slab unless your are really hungry or 8 ounce burgers are appitizers
id rather get the bowls over the smoothies though
the simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there right
it taste more like a liquid dessert than a juice
i liked the booze and i was okay with the bartender who was slow to take my order and may have or may not have wanted to burn my face with a cigarette
ladies get yourself a ladies vip blue martini card get a free drink everytime you come in between 49pm
every time ive been in here the bar staff is friendly and attentive
ive had a smattering of things
the bartenders were very friendly and had tons of knowledge about each beer
i can say 14 is a little steep for any soft shell crab and should be executed perfectly for that price
aces and ales is also know for their beer themed events
the coco roll was still good im guessing they still have good quality fresh ingredients
there are many choices in las vegas  and this is hands down a great restaurant that always comes through
good  the nigiri salad was goodishthe grab bag selection of raw fish diced was generally good and most were tasty and chilled
picture a humongous chicken patty with melted cheddar cheese on top of it
keep your eyes for the blondie behind the bar wear very little clothes
i really liked the design and layout room was really spacious and could easily accomodate 6 people comfortable 4 people on the 2 queen beds and 2 people on the long and large sofa in the living space
the atmosphere is very laid back and they have many cool games to play
it is worth the trip
her ordered a second glass
the pages are falling out and the books are tattered
i did order a drink and the waitress gave me warning that it is sweetened with bitters i said i like bitters
they also have a signature drink ill have to try that next time fancy beer drinks
drinking a huge cup of diet coke while doing this was not too smart as my gut felt like it was going to explode
returned 52916 tried the seafood hot pot which was really good
guy who despite seeing that really hot girl making out with another girl still thinks hes got a chance and seems legitimately confused when girl is not interested in him
the food is good
would come back again in a heart beat
came here for dinner with a friend very busy had to wait 20 mins to get seated and had to share a table which i dont mind but they kept mixing up which party ordered what which was understandable
sounds like a great experience  not  well this is where things started to go bad
not dense and foamy but more like youd get if you didnt rinse a glass and there was still soap in it
so we ordered nachos
if you are in downtown phoenix this is a must go to
after a long day on the strip we wanted to relax with some drinks and tapas with a local friend of mine
ana is the best server
this place is bad the managers steal the waiters tips
heres where i get disappointed  it took over 20 minutes to bring the water  long after the popcorn was delivered
two for one beer we were in
i forget what his steak came withbut i do remember the plate being completely empty and him saying that it was very very good
the servers also forgot an item or two and utensils so everything arrived piece meal  not ideal
long wait times every single time and they have messed up my order countless times
we have never been disappointed in the food
my moms salad came without dressing so the waitress went back to retrieve it
hubby really enjoyed the house red ale
ruhige atmosphre bei gedmpftem licht
i was hopeful that one of them would step up and try to answer our questions but nope
tvs are visible from most seats and the sand is a nice touch
the guy showed us how to use the computer system and how to play the game
it came with this lobster infused and chunks of lobster israeli couscous that just went with it so well
the miso soup is perfect
i would definitely go back
we sat outside in the patio area and we were quickly greeted with friendly service
def will skip this brunch next time im in town
having worked in the industry myself i would have called off work if i thought my mood was going to effect my customers experience
the pizza is worth the guilt
i dined with three friends and every dish that hit the table was well executed and greatly enjoyed
it could do without the obnoxious fruit machine but that aside there really isnt anything not to like
another guy who worked at the club got me a drink and then took me and my friend to the stage
however the chili was terrible
yasu is a hair better than shiros in seattle which is head by a chef who is an apprentice of jiro ono of dreams of sushi fame
i come for the food and service
i think there may have been a hockey game that night but being female and from ireland my knowledge ends with the fact that they play hockey on ice wearing skates
then when mine arrived it was not 12 lb
i chose 3 stars bc it depends what you are looking for  i see it as barcelona north
its certainly the place to go for a good time
if you are thinking of going to a sushi place and location is stoping you from going too far just go instead to the jct fusion restaurant down the street at kennedy square
if ur in vegas this place is a must
the girls were of variety ethnicity size skill
he makes the best cucumber cocktails and hes funny and interesting to talk to while letting me and my crowd to be the center of attention
id come back if im in the mood for thai food on my next vegas trip
i appreciated the purse hooks under the bar for my girlfriend
our waitress not only gave us recommendations on what to order but how best to eat it once ordered in a cool irish accent no less
good light food and really good drinks
daytime good for families and groups with kids happy hour til 4 i think o0  nighttime gets the younger crowd of foodies but its still great atmosphere
some of our dishes were very mediocre but the wild boar is such a great dish that it pushed our rating up to a 35
they were all so good
i will never ever ever go there again
you really wont find another great brewery handcrafted like these anywhere around the area
and has bibimbap on the menu
overall impresion of mgm is poor
sad to say i soon joined the textandburn crowd outside the front entrance
the restaurant looks like a hole in the wall from the outside so i was concerned that i might have come to a bad area
the environment is really nice i especially like it for lunch
if you are tourist do you need to come here
super friendly service from every single person including the busboywait staff
staff was very helpful
i took my mother here for thanksgiving and they served a traditional turkey meal for her and i got some chicken since i dont like turkey
very impressed with the presentation and quality of food
fair warning dont come here for rolls
the roof opens to the desert sky lights and the fog machine goes off and everyone gets crazy to the music
i only wished there were more places like this in vegas
i will not be going back
the popcorn is highly overrated
after dinner was over and the check was paid i felt so blissful that it was struggle to get up and leave
my son had a plain hamburger and we ordered it cooked medium
and i didnt catch the guys name when i picked up  were very greatawesomefriendlypatientinformative
make sure you participate they will shine that flashlight on you and pull you on stage if you dont participate
we were impressed by the atmosphere and the menu
still huge just not nearly as good
one thing is they did forget our order and we actually had to wait to get our drinks til after we ate ramen
the all you could eat menu is not limited to the sushi but practically every thing on their regular menu from steak appetizer to shrimp tempura and even includes dessert
i ordered the garlic edamame and it had amazing toasted garlic flavor
the half sandwich was giant and flavorful but super messy
great customer servicepeople skillsnot
it had a soft texture with a subtle fishy taste in a good way
we both agreed the wings tasted like they were precooked reheated wings that you could find the frozen aisle of your grocery market
overall very good and would eat there again
when we finally got to the front the bouncer checking ids apparently doesnt know what a passport looks like and asked for a second opinion
glad to find this neighborhood gem
its bar food and its okish
i had chicken curry with rice and my husband had the steak
definitely worth the visit
i will start this out by saying as of today no response from the venue
the decor is simple and nothing ornate making it feel like a nice  family restaurant
their patio is very inviting too  with couches and a fireplace nice strings of lights too creating the perfect atmosphere
this is by far the worst zipps in arizona time and time again
id eat here if the steaks were 32 with sides
plenty of seating in and around the bar
love the food and great atmosphere
chef csar has traveled extensively and was actually born and raised in peru
now go to handlebar and get orval on tap
i asked for the check and barely touched my food after
halfway into the meal the server mentioned that she noticed the gravy was still sitting on the servery and that she had forgotten it
i had just truck tacos and got lots of steak with it
our server raina was great
the waiter who brought our drinks spilled my dads tea on his shirt arm and all over the table
i would like to say the service was efficient and professional but unfortunately the only server on staff was busy texting so it took a while to settle my bill
the sushi
this was also one of the few places within the past year that i actually got excited over trying
the choices of food was excellent as was my selection piggy mac  cheese sandwich
second up was the korean steak taco
la premiere chose qui saute aux yeux est la dcoration du lieu
they run a tight ship and get you the drinks prompt and with a good attitude
everything on it was delicious even the turkey
all in all if you want a good bowl of pho stick to vietnam palace on south boulevard
went here for girls night out because we heard that you could sit anywhere no vip or bottle service that was reason enough to check it out and so glad we did
to a westsider like myself tempe is the mecca of mischief a place where i can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell
in the end this is a really cool place to hang out
an excellent selection of both beer and wine with excellent service to boot
we did not know the concept of asian tapas and were surprised that they would taste that good
in fact every ipic theater goer this weekend
he would have been deterred however by a quasihomeless lady who appointed herself as the keeper of the velvet rope declared the place was over the occupancy limit and filtered people in by the twos once she deemed them acceptable
she tells me that since we already ordered food we have to eat at the bar
9 for a miniature bottle of water
curran and mike behind the bar during the day are awesome
wouldnt mind going here for a date or to take friend and family
you have to wait in a line downstairs until people leave
i really enjoyed the food it was filled with various flavors the serving size was perfect even though i had some left overs
i came here during the evening a few months ago and had the mussels and foie gras
kitchen is just a nook on the side of the bar
the attire is pretty casual
also my first and often second choice from the extensive beer list is almost always missing making me wonder if they dont update the menu frequently enough
however one time here was negative in result of a bad drink called and fire green as grass
they originally sat us in an odd corner at a 2 person table yes there were only 2 of us but we didnt want to sit there
we also ordered two sides the mac n cheese which was very good im very picky when it comes to mac n cheese and the burnt end beans which were also great
they have omakase here
they really didnt care
my dad got the prime roast and again it was flavorless
in addition to the great flavor there are small chunks of lobster throughout
the sushi isnt fresh probably because this place is a ghost town
i had the campechana and it had so much seafood in it it was amazing
whoever the bartender was that took my order hope it was just an off day
they were 3 per order i went with panseared shrimp
i decided to see what would happen so i did
at duffs you can split up flavours i think as long as each flavour is in denominations of 10 bottom line st louis is pretty good but compared to duffs its highly unlikely youll encounter lines of people waiting for their wings
they are open until 11pm during the week later than most in the neighbourhood
got a free banana nut muffin too
also wir rein mit kinderwagen wurden aber gleich gestoppt und dann mit dem hinweis konfrontiert wir knnen uns entscheiden das kind aus dem schlaf zu holen und aus dem kinderwagen raus damit dieser nach draussen geschoben werden kann oder doch das lokal wieder zu verlassen
i love their beer selection
the garlic knotts were fine nothing special they come with marinara sauce for dipping which was good
park across the street at busey or in the urbana parking garage behind red star
i came here because i was hid with a sudden and severe craving for ramen and yelp helpfully told me this might well be the only place in town that does it
the food was delicious and the service was sincerely amazing
this place is a great little secret thai restaurant in town
these are of fairly average quality  though i have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas
pair it with a blue cheese wedge salad and finish with a glass of justin 2008 cabernet and its absolute heaven
i had the fez salad which was a combination of baby greens sliced almonds dried cherries not 100 percent sure could have been another dried fruit moroccan flavorings seasoned chicken and a mild dressing
still had room for a brownie though
club although i hear the food is great i have yet to make it to the restaurant
and do not be fooled these were adults
vintner grill is a neighborhood gem
not too loud but loud enough to be fun
the bruschetta bard comes with 4 bruschetta of your choicethe food is great the wine selection is very good ask for recommendations from the staff if you need it
i had several sushi rolls that were very fresh
thats where i stopped looking for my drink of choice
food was great but with caveats
we sent the first order back and the master sushi prepared two more rolls and asked that we try it right away to prevent the rice from drying out unfortunately the second time wasnt the charm
the full bar is appreciated but the wine is all on tap so the red wine comes out cold
a friend brought me here  while i was visiting for the weekend
the food aint fancy or amazing but its good for what it is
good job lidia
at least be a little original with your dishes
the quesadilla was probably 2 inches high because the vegetables were just laying in this grease filled tortilla
ein vershnlicher abschluss
always run out of uni during lunch hour
of coarse we had dessert
my favorite thing about the whole experience was the service
unfortunately not all the take out beer is that good
we visit the house of blues for homegrown thursdays when local bands take the stage and you get to eat and have a show
the dish lived up to the hype for me even though i think this was my first alfredo dish in at least 10 years
prime rib was good but it was a very fatty cut of meat more fatty than other prime rib steaks ive had at other steakhouses
mein gingerale war bepreist wie das gute und bekannte markenprodukt serviert wurde aber wenn auch reichlich eingeschenkt eine billigversion ohne den erwarteten geschmack
the drinks were overpoured and not very well made
starterssnacks definitely dont miss the broccoli tempura its absolutely killer and light
i had read a lot of reviews about the poor service and was pleasantly surprised to have wonderful service
only one time did my steak not turn out the best
try the sriracha aoli and yuzu sauce mixed
the pizza was outstanding
the staff was nicefriendly and attentive which is always a plus and we danced the whole night even the non dancers got caught up in the fun
the waitress offered to bring me water but my owner already had a bowl and water bottle along with some special treats to keep me from fraternizing with the other patrons
i wish it were a tiny bit bigger though because im too intimidated to come in on a saturday night the waits are probably insane
i dip the fries into this sauce
it was fantastic
weekday evenings it has just the right mood  not over crowded ever  so you are able to carry on a conversation without issue
finding their location i walked in to a pretty busy donut shop
this place its a rip off went with my friend there meet my friends there so we say all together so the waiter told you must to pay tipbut guess what the bill was 193 and the mandatory tip was 70 its 36never be back
my boyfriend got a beef chicken and asparagus platter that was still sizzling when it arrived
custom beer flight cant wait to come back and drink my way through the rotating board
if you havent been here youre missing out on serious customer service quality
such an amazing texture very good with ginger and the yuzu
its hooters though   i feel like you get what you pay for maybe
not appealing at all
lately theyve changed all of their recipes and no longer use any real fruit
my mushroom ravioli was delicious and my mom had their chicken fettuccine alfredo and it was mediocre
they have every type of jamesons whisky there is i counted 5 different types and bottle after bottle of scotch
it took me awhile to realize that no mustard was spread on the hot dog
if you check in on yelp it comes with free desert
i saw some pretty cool tables one was a lot lower than the rest of the bar like it was down in a pit  guess you have to come pretty early to claim that cool spot
the lobster tails were delicious and a generous size
the restaurant gave off this sad vibe and was just living out its last days until its closure at the end of the year
service was good
entrees are always delicious i seem to order one of the daily specials and my husband always goes for the linguini and clam sauce which he likes so much here he wont order it any place else
just not my scene or really many others for that matter
not too pricey
sides were delicious  meat was tender
i also had a very competent duck confit salad while my friend had the beef tartare
it didnt mesh welli suggest you ask for different sides
i expected corn and cheese but not tons of onions
the food was so generically terrible i dont know why someone would spend money on it
check this place out
i enjoyed the crispy chicken skin sandwichbahn mi
now i dont mind a fried item but lifting up a spring roll and finding a large pool of oil isnt appetizing to anyone
im looking forward to coming back again and hopefully having better luck with the food
i live near casey moores but thats kid stuff
we only ordered the medium level after reading the reviews below because other people commented on the crazy spiciness
money plays is an old vegas pub
youre better off sitting at the bar so at least you can hand the order sheet to the sushi chef
even though my glass sat full for the rest of my meal the bartender did not inquire if i liked it
not the best ive ever had but certainly very tasty
a friend ordered a totally different one and it was equally amazing yet totally different
we were in the mood to celebrate taco tuesday
besides that i ordered shots of jager and i asked the waitress to have them chilled
wings had great flavor
the park rd location had more bottled than draft or so it seemed
we also ordered an order each of the garlic and rosemary fries and the harissa fries
my first time here was a lot better but i still love this place and will be coming back
this also was 14
a friend took me here for lunch on a weekday
she makes sure that you are happy and i feel like i came to someones home for dinner
the crab fried rice was the only normal priced item we ordered
if you are pregnant or are just a bigger person you will either be uncomfortable or just plainly not fit
arrived late to see the ballet so we took our chances on an entirely new place
food ok  the wings need to be ordered extra crispy in my opinion
we went got downtown to look around but much of the places were closed
who would have known in the palace station casino right
they also char over a gas grill not a charcoal like expected
this place is la bomba
the good thing
we were there on a game night and it does get rather load due to the constricting layout
our server didnt come back but to drop off the check and had to be asked for another refill on my drink before she disappeared again that was depleted early in my meal from it being spicy
theres enough room for all the kids to run and play
pros  nice server good happy hour
the calzone was messy and was served on paper
the place looked nice decorated with awesome painting and the customer service was great very helpful
the service is soso here but the great appetizers food and drinks help make up for it not to mention the 15 tvs for live games
the man i spoke with on the phone blamed it on postmates
we tried to speak with the owner but he was on the phone
its alright but its not great like the khao san road equivalent
the best part about this club is the cool ceiling
maybe he was having a bad day but nevertheless it was very unprofessional for him especially at a fine dining restaurant
flavours were good and tasted good and i was definitely sated when i was done
the mussels were effin awesome
also the whole thing is incredibly salty between the salty fries the salty sausage and the salty cheese the dish really couldve used something to cut through the salt
the girls were all pretty and fun and the dj was nice enough to get two of our friends 1 birthday boy and 1 first timer on stage for a dance each
he is a strong believer in fresh is best and runs a very efficient kitchen
great cocktails awesome bruschetta and really good people watching
the pasta had a good texture and it was the widest pappardelle ive seen i liked that but many of my pasta strands were stuck together
the staff was incredibly attentive friendly and personable
its a piano bar
1 also i love that the place is so new that it still smells like freshcut wood
the music is fun the food is german not everybodys cup of tea but i like it  and there are always the giant pretzels the beer is deliciously large and the peoplewatching is spectacular
i think itd be a great party spot but for being empty it lacked energy
i dont see why they couldnt try a communal table
the restaurant was at full capacity after we sat
and let me tell you this place is amazing
service i was served with water without ice without being asked
unfortunately the sweet potatoes in the hash were completely undercooked and disgusting
the servers were all nice  knowledgeable the prices were good for what we got and the food was fast
we usually go on friday nights when they have a live musician
the size was only slightly larger than a ping pong ball and 6 came out in a bowl but the meatballs were dense with chicken and rich with flavor
we shared the banana pudding and key lime desserts and felt they had a good variety of cocktails
we rang in new years 2010 at mix lounge in vegas
after seeing so many positive reviews i have to say i just dont get it
they have the absolute best chicken fettucini alfredo in the world
i was informed over an hour wait and they would inform me via text when our table was ready
this included one glass of wine at 795 and one beer for 475
there was pee all over the floor
i believe there were some others in there as well but i cant recall
and the food oh the food
just like at jamba boosts eg
halfoff starts at 10pm and goes to close
my other complaint was that their so called fried cheese curds were the worst i ever tastedtoo greasy not flavorful and served with blue cheese dressing gross
not sure what the theme of this art work was supposed to represent
i sat at the sushi bar the service was swift and appropriate and appreciated
i have had their katsudon and its also fantastic
there is also very limited seating
excellent polish food in a totally unique housecafeteria line setting
clearly no one associated with tk ever does any knd of quality control here
so an hour passes by and we ask the waitress if she can let us know when the pizza might be ready
i get the 4oz scoop of protein and its a lot and the cost is about 10 which is about the price of a sushi burrito and its just as super good
when they talk about a penny machine they need to mean it
not only is it coated with the corn flakes at the top but also at the bottom of the ice cream
i am so happy that i did
total lack of common sense
longniddry inn is a quaint pub kitchen serving up some brews for locals and also some grub for those with the munchies
great little spot to get some craft beers in old town scottsdale across the way from all of the other bars
my fav by far is the jay jay rollshrimp tempura avocado philly creamcheese asparagus wrapped in seaweed and ricetopped with eel saucemelts in your mouth
the food is amazing
a lot more options than most other bars we found in montreal especially in the old district
for our main entrees i had the crab cake platter with hush puppies and beerbattered onion rings
to put it simply if you want to go out drinking with friends for a celebration or something theres no finer place than this
bricktops has the best in charlotte but they have amazing calamari their tuna nachos are sooo good and i love their oreo milkshake its a fun atmosphere
overall i am glad i stopped at this location while casinohopping
overall if youre on a budget and want to splurge on other things and just need a place to sleep this is it
ok but you heard us when we said we had 10 people right
our waiter was hilarious and sassy and very patient with our large party
the prices are mediumhigh not outrageous for a restaurant in this area
as a vegetarianvegan i am so in love with the food here
right away i thought of hawthornes
the decor reminded me my school days
we tried the bruschetta which according to many reviews was top notch
the salmon was second best
i urge you to review the internal regulations of the place and notify the reason for the discrimination committed or place an announcement at the door stating that only american citizens will be admitted
i was glad in a way the salad was small because there would have been no way i could finish that delicious gyro
we had early lunch and i hadnt had breakfast so i was thrilled that they had breakfast all day
ambiance service layout and design and the history of the building is more than inviting
mt girlfriends family has made a tradition of going here every year for dinner on new years day why we keep going when one of the kids got their meal after everyone else ate last year anyways i tried a few things on the menu until i came across the souvlaki the meat veg and rice was nothing special but wow did i ever fall in love with the dressing on the greek salad
she added chicken to it with out me asking which was 199 extra
it was delicious and the portion is plenty for 14 dollars
he ordered the mac  cheese for his side and it was terrible
jeny is such a sweetheart and is sure to keep my drink full and make sure everything is perfect
we were greeted immediately and told to sit wherever we wanted
we also tried the fish egg soup and the seafood hot pot nothing special
ps if you ask you can get free cotton candy
our server didnt even flinch which i loved
we came here for lunch on a college visit tour
you can easily get in and out for less than 20person but the bill can easily skyrocket much higher if you opt for a higherendfuller dining experience with sushisashimi andor a number of appetizers and drinks to go with your meal
i was impressed with her skill and now its one of my favorite hidden gems
i honestly couldnt say enough good things about azara
admission into the club seemed efficient and organized it felt as if we were waiting in line at a theme park though
the food was topnotch
they seem lazy and half the time you have to go find one of them to get anything
i definitely felt out of place
its a great place for either dinner or drinks later at night especially in the winter
very nice place the atmosphere and staff are friendly and the pricing is on point
happy hour is amazing including a 6 huge veggie plate
or if youre feeling hearty try king size prime rib meatloaf alfredo with garlic bread many more
i wish i could have managed dessert as i can imagine it would be just as delicious as the other two courses but we just couldnt eat any more
this place has really stepped their game up in the past few years
looks like a boobie a tofu dome with a dollop of ginger right in the middle  was this on purpose
i turned to my foodie partner and stated theres a yelp star going up just for that
delicious flare bread
the writing is on the wall this chain wasnt the salvation to improve park west you made it worse
crisp salty and delicious
we will be back over and over again
the service staff is obviously not properly trained how to treat customers right
but i do think this bar is for those yinzers who are there for a cheap beer a game of pool and a good time and unfortunately that involves smoking for the majority of them
rather than promote sensible alcohol consumption she appears to actively encourage overindulgence apparently frequently turning up for work either nursing a hangover or at times still under the influence of alcohol
but i loved that they had sriracha sauce in the lazy susan on the table
most of the crowd favorites arent even on the dinner menu masalamakhani korma sag rogan josh etc
it was a rip off
my first impression overpriced and overrated
not just a great wine place but also a good variety of beers
rudely    this club sucks
this is far and away the best location
served by itamae aki everything is excellent
chris is a personal favorite seriously hell keep you coming back for more
another way that you can easily spend hours here
i bought 2 of the groupon deals 5 for 10 worth of product
sometimes greggs just hits the spot
hot food the selection here is smaller than at cheaper buffets so there was only one style of dim sum pot stickers filled with bbq pork i think none of the usual nonchinese offerings possibly not a loss depending and a limited array of main dishes
i usually think yard house is on top of things but i guess they werent that night
would def go again
way worth it
definite flavor explosion from the first bite to the last
there is a great little patio in the front of the restaurant a bar with some seating available and a small to medium sized main dining room
disclaimer if i could give it a zero i would
each portion was the size of an hors doeuvre and just fairly mediocre
this is a small but decent sport book
the sides were also very good especially the mashed potatoes and four cheese mac and cheese
if youre starving and on a budget i would highly recommend this place
decorating for halloween with real baby pumpkins was a nice touch
also drinks are heavily liquored here which is always a good thing because alcohol aint cheap on the strip
they were losing and the scattered patrons at the bar werent happy
the portions can be minuscule too so the overall price on its own deserves a 3 prepare to spend at least 70 for 2 not including drinks
the hubster and i came in for a dinner and it was packed
a great unassuming building with a great patio and a small interior space this quaint little place dishes up some great pizza
the fish is extremely fresh and perfectly cut
it not like most place tv far away right in front of you
but cheap doesnt always make it good
he also let me know ahead of time that the food was taking longer than expected before i commited to ordering
the best sushi buffet to go to everything is always fresh and delicious made to order
service was very good  but my overall impression of the restaurant was overpriced and good but not excellent under las vegas standards
hakka noodles  extra spicy
best sushi place in vegas area
and a what the hell well share a 6 piece order of suicide wings was tossed in at the end
once in florida once in cali and finally here in vegas
i got super full fast from everything so was only able to have a few bites from my potatoes
not a bad thing on the menu
this is a beautiful restaurant and kitchen
also on the plate my baked potato two chunks of red pepper and two asparagus spears
i love this place
i cant really recommend anything else other than the 5star worthy miso cod
it seems everyone that did a review on yelp raved bout it one even said it was the best in the city and comparable to the ones out east
it is sort of small but i literally loved everything
before start with the restaurant i just want to note that i had no idea there was this little street east 4th corner cleveland downtown
nachteilig sind die wenigen parkmglichkeiten auf die man als mittagessensbesucher angewiesen ist
it will only leave me wishing i were at burgatory
were still not really sure what is going on with the menus what is more cost effective or what comes with what
came here for lunch today with the hubbie
i used to love going here
regardless ill be back for some hh pretzels yummm
allgemein teuer und schlecht
i was addicted to that pig
last time we went we got there around 4 on a saturday and it was a two hour wait
plus everyone i took there says this place will definitely be a regular visit
start with the guys that do the spray paint portrait i remember years ago the sign said no pictures they enforce that really hard it now i have a bucket for tips
its obviously growing and going through learning curves
the food was good and the price was right
if i could do it again id get a pizza but both werent worth what i paid
i loved it
the locations and environment is cozy and beautiful
deals on tacos taco salad and margaritas
until thanksgiving weekend my brotherinlaw suggested that we all go there for dinner
about 10 min
we should have just gone there
i hope it was worth it to get my extra few dollars to lose a customer
3 separate types of mushrooms were included and the rib had a ncie spice to it
go here for lunch with parents
we ended up leaving because we did not want to spend any money at this place
i usually stop by jamba juice in the evenings when the lines are short or nonexistent
the food looked as if it had been at the buffet stations for hours
ignore the silly name this is a high quality sushi restaurant
about 10 minutes after me and my guest notice a man walking in from outside with clothing from a dry cleaners
so my brother and i ordered ayce and i honestly thought it was basically a crappy work of art and taste
the rice is hard and fell apart when picking up the nigiri and the ahi poki came out in 2 seconds meaning it was premade sitting around
i wasnt hungry when i arrived but i still had a great meal
though its pricey i justified it by treating it as an experience not just food
red carpet entrance and horribly silly and stupid revolving door set the tone for this ridiculous adventure
it smells so good i know this sounds funny but this casino has an awesome air freshener system
groupon had a link to the full menu when i purchased so i didnt think there would be restrictions
exemplary service and reasonably priced wine and food for the amazing quality that it was
seriously there is literally a giant a picture of a person smoking a pipe in the back room
so i stuck to a usual glass of red for 10 which was a safe choice
the place was packed and he offered to have us dine at the sofas in the middle of the restaurantwe politely declined as we prefer a regular table
but its just a fact everyone should know
no kidding  barchef is awesome
i hate being that guy that gives a place with great reviews a not so great review
the curds are fried the guinness gravy is slamming and the fries are just the right amount of potato
thank you spirit bar
but the margarita phenomenal   i think my next time there will just be a chips and salsa margarita day anyone wanna join me
the service was not spectacularly fast but they were friendly and obliging
the mushroom dish is very buttery as well
as far as food goes its just ok the garlic fries are alright and the chicken tacos are pretty good
the peppercorncrusted new york strips peppercorn crust was delicious and seasoned well
bathrooms are a bit dirty and i havent tried the food but this is a solid place for pong and pool
thanks to yelp and all the great reviews that made me select this
recently stopped by here the last time i was in town after seeing it on ddd and all i can say is what a welcomed and refreshing change of pace from the usual internationallyinspired restaurant
the draft beer is tasty and i got the steak sandwich which was super yum
i stopped in here with my wife to meet a colleague for a meeting that ended up lasting a couple of hours
what the hell can i say about this place
karen is typically my barista and she is awesome
he insisted at our table that we had an extra steak ordered
they are more like onion strings that werent crispy and were greasy
we were starving so before entering we asked the bouncer if they were still serving food
however during the day i saw my own server doing shots at another table
the remainder of our night was enjoyable our server and the two vibrant hostesses we spoke with early came to check on us and see if we had everything we needed and how the food was
loved this place we enjoyed a valentines dinner with my three children and mother the staff was friendly accurate and knowledgeable about their menu
the bar was very busy which is good to see
i had so much fun just watching the bartenders
this is a really cool bar in aria
horribleive been there  before for a non profit org
our server was inattentive and rude to us during happy hour forcing us to flag him down three separate times for our drink and food orders during happy hour and then completely disappearing once happy hour was over without asking us if we wanted our bill
this time to start i chose the ontario garlic shrimp
if you like sashimi and sushi thats the place to go
the restaurant is open and airy with good views of the neighborhood
i got the all day menu plus the sushi extra 7 and it was worth it
i look at the golf bag im carrying  which belongs to my 8 year old son who can hit it about 75 yards if he catches it all but say ok cool we wont use it
there was also a singer that made it impossible to have a decent conversation and didnt have any business singing he is awful
thats finesince its expensive to get into the club anyways
it reminds me of the scene in ratatouille when remy describes the taste of the strawberry and cheese together to his brother
grassroots then proceeded to inform us they wouldnt serve us
we were served by a very polite and thoughtful waiter
all of the balls were amazing
our server did an okay job
nice people too
this restaurant will not last long as i see others have had similar experiences
to sum up there arent a ton of places in scottsdale that i can say the food is amazing
i have never had better arabic food in arizona before this
you can really taste the smoky flavours in each bite
you get a main dish rice salad and an orange for under 4
the prices for gaming is standard
the crab cakes were solid not pacific nw good but still great for the middle of the desert
cant wait to come back
the burger patties were just a frozen patty again nothing special
topped off the burger with some homemade dijon and monterey jack cheese
i would not recommend this place if you want good mexican food
we arrived and with it being thursday football the place was busy
the atmosphere is decent fitting to the decor and food
we grabbed a table next to the bar
the only activity was clustered around the simpatico stand
it was a sunday night and there was a football game on and the restaurant was very busy and noisy but our waitress told us that everyone usually left as soon as the game finished which they mostly did
and now i am on a mission to try everything on the menu
overall i wouldnt come back to this location as the excessive amount of noise kills it for me
we wanted a nightcap in the lobby and were told they did last call at midnite because it hadnt been busy
i will give parallax 4 stars because i enjoyed everything i ate but the seating arrangements could be enough to turn some people off
we ordered the large pizza but probably couldve gotten away with the smaller size since we ended up taking about half of it home
i generally try not to complain about businesses and generally try to live by the if you have nothing nice to say say nothing at all rule but the things is i have soooo many nice things to say about this place
the description sounded yummy but it didnt live up to the menu at all
i sat at the bar during lunch on friday
the drink got was ok but i have hope in the other drinks
its not extremely dirty it is as clean as it can be with a ton of drunk people around all the time but it just smells like bathroom
finally we settled in and ordered a few beers
i been driving past here the last few weeks been here several times when it was santoras finally stopped in to check it out the bartender was very nice she explained all the promotions
my husband was in food service for over 13 years bartender and server  so he understands that this happens and its hard to keep up sometimes
im reaaallly gonna miss the place
it is renowned to be the best butter in the world
that said la cave offered several different wine flights as well as an extensive menu of bytheglass or bottles
saturday nite visit and the joint was hopping
did i mention the 34 allucaneat sushi menu
it was a hefty portion and  served with three different sauces
they have food and drink you dont see everywhere
not to mention the red bean ice cream which is my favourite ice cream wasnt all that great
45minutes later and a second phone call maintenance man comes up and no security and the guy helps us break into our room
i cant wait to see how it turns out
amazing whiskey tasting
its certainly not a super high quality restaurant with topnotch service but if youre interested in asian buffets this is an excellent place to dine
the cookies and cream mini dessert mousse was yummy though
i had the confit of duck leg with squash
service the waiter while not your traditional asian restaurant type was fast friendly courteous and good at anticipating what was needed
service was very laid back yet friendly and welcoming
i guess theyre reminiscent of mexican pottery but they looked like they could contain lead
i ordered a short rib taco and it was excellent well balanced with queso fresco  yum
they have dippin dots and dole whip which is great but its kind of pricey and they run out of dippin dots flavors sometimes
also the best cocktail on the menu was the lychee caipirinha
rula bula  boeher hospitality llc is the only place that has done this
they had a dj and a live artist painting which was awesome
not going back here ever
cant wait to go back
i also ordered the truffle parmesean fries and the mr miyagi burger
it came out with a 14 inch head that disappeared to no head in about 5 seconds
the fish was flash fried and the flesh was sweet and juicy atop with house special sauce similar to sweet and sour sauce
tried the truffle mac and cheese balls but they lacked flavor
oishii is one of growing number of sushi restaurants in edinburgh but does a good job of standing out from the crown
there is no place betterno place better than gringo if you want local color fun and football
we went on a monday and the line was so long
i dont remember exactly what my group ordered but there was not one dish that i did not enjoy
since moving to las vegas i have become fully entrenched in this cities obsession with hamburgers
our waiter was on point every second even though it was very clear that he had just been slammed with 5 tables
though i have no idea about the food at this place i am cheating
french green beans tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds
others has fish  chips and cuban sandwich
when my fianc and i drove into the dark shopping center parking lot the one place illuminated was lotus of siam
over easy or sunny up would have made it perfect
for a little locals place this place is great and the other reviewers didnt lie
stopped in for take out recently
its a ways away from the strip but this place is priced right and the food is great here
this cocktail was long and brightly coloured which almost made me feel like i was in a bar abroad
when i walked in with my husband instead of going to a table filled with his friends and family we were thrown into a crowded bar area where he accidentally encountered the people who were supposed to be at our party
this is the only place i routinely go for karaoke
the view is absolutely amazing
i found every server and staff to be friendly and warm
the beer was decent and seemed to be well kept
if you havent been deff keeper in mind
downtown chandler has come a long way
the food wasnt amazing but they did prepare the bonein filet rare as i had asked
i only wish there had been a few more because i didnt really want to share
to make the long story short la accepted us with open arms
that being said the place has been under new managementownership since late 08
cocktail hours are very limited though so be sure to call ahead or check their website
everything was half off
great new find not far from home
we thought wed give it a try and our first problem was parking
it will cost you
our party had appetizers pasta a sandwich and pizza that was to die for
delicious moist flavorful and spectacular does only begin to describe my meal
we will be back for sure
id say not good for groups meaning larger than 4 cause the place is kinda small
neither of us were too impressed with our desserts
most of the dishes we tried were combinations of a lot of flavors and ended up a bit messy
so glad we did had a lovely table on the patio and a great server cat who let us go at our own pace which is always nice
the portions were ample but not huge the prices were what i would expect for a fancy dinner out on the town at the biltmore  we call it upper middlebrow dining perhaps
happy hour is great
your best bet is to order several and share with your friends
oh and if you cant find parking right in front of the restaurant theres a whole big parking deck behind and on top where you can take the stairs or elevator
came back during nfl games
theres a sweet lady thats a server there and she is the best
some thing thats easy to do here
we were promptly greeted by our server and served our drinks
let me stress they were not busy  no excuse for such slow service wanting to escape the agony i set my credit card on the table a clear sign we were ready to go
its good the tasting menu is worth trying but next time we will try smth else
if you actually want a drink try the front bar where theres real service
das essen wir hatten kssptzle mit speck und einem salat vom buffet und marinierte hhnchenbrust mit erdbeerpfeffersauce und dauphinekartoffeln
had to stand and wait a while for a seat but eventually got one for the four of us on a friday night
luckily i was able to join my friends downstairs for some drinks and dancing so the night didnt end that badly
over the last year with changes to new head chefs the quality has gone down yet it seems like everything now cost 2 more than before
great ambiance and service and the specialty cocktails were delicious
next time we go we plan on sharing a bottle of wine from their extensive list
staff were friendly and helpful service was good atmosphere was great
the tea was tasteless and so were the boba that accompanied it
love this spoti give this spot 2 snaps uplol
the bartender was also ignoring other customers trying to get his attention
if you read my other reviews you know i work in customer service for tips
the guacamole was good though
they just need one of those little mini counter trash cans for their sample spoons
fries  meh
the beer is cool the wine terrible it is a pub
im there to help with their costs as long as i feel like im being properly fed both good food and accurate information
it was packed
8  whoopie pie dark chocolate peppermint crunch gelato raspberry coulis
i come here at least 34 days a week
i dont know if it was because i hadnt had japanese food in awhile or if it was because i was tired of eating the same food every day but sushi  sake was great
overall experience is good korean waitresses are hot
that was brittanys suggestion working on the nutella sandwich for dessert so i must go now wish me luck
my husband even got a surprise message from the gm because we were happy with the restaurant and staff and servicehe was comped a nice gift card
i had never flown porter until the other night
my friends came here to get burgers so i waited outside with them
food was okay
would be fun to check out for happy hour i will definitely come back there were plenty of items on the menu that i want to try
all in all it was pretty decent but i still think 6 bucks a slider is pretty steep even with the 3 for 15 combo
the service was on point the drink menu is solid and the food was delicious
we had a phillysteak and it was awesome
i love me a happy hour that starts at 300 in the afternoon
i really wasnt in the mood to hear the same old tired karaoke standards being garbled by drunken tourists though
i was a bit nervous about the balsamic glazesome people can really kill a pizza using itbut this was spot on
chocolate brownie good but apple crisp fell flat
one of the entrees we ordered was a maki combo with one of the sushi rolls being crab
overall a nicely polished bar in a good location
i love spicy so the beef pho was perfect
the service was not good
we also ordered the pearfect salad 900
the girls recommended the regular favorites and i could not be more happy i went with their recommendations
the bar is cozy and the music is conducive to that experience
they truly are top notch without being stuffy
the atmosphere is what a real buger joint should be
very good nm style food
the owner greeted us when we walked in
bekamen einen hsslichen wackeligen tisch ganz am ussersten rand
highly recommend this place if your looking to have some fun on a night out
i just feel so annoyed that everything on the menu is so overpriced and i paid for it thinking it must be really good and have plenty for leftovers no
not loving the new pei wei
the patatas bravas were glorified french fries  i was extremely disappointed with these
today i stood there for a good 3 minutes while the people in the back chatted and the girl at the register avoided eye contact with me
was disappointed with the spiceness level of their table sauces 4 kinda and had to pay 150 extra for the hotter sauce
remember the good old days when rock and hip hop were still alive and when the sushi joints used to provide salad miso and ice cream with whatever you ordered
still worth a visit for a simple drop by
service wasnt bad though
ill be back its worth it
fries were great too not too oily or heavy either
but im sure hell remember the 2 that we left on the table for his tip
the height is off
i was shocked that it tasted good
wonderful service amazing romantic atmosphere and most important the food was amazing
everything is always on point
we came here because its our neighborhood pub
this is my new favorite restaurant on the strip
dranks were bomb
i am a frequent customer at tropical  smoothie not only for their amazing smoothies but because they support camp sunshine in maine where i have been many times when my child was battling cancer
nice tvs showing a variety of different channels  i appreciate that they have fox or cnn on some of the tvs not just sports
special events with amazing light shows they were even covered in the huffington post in october 2015 tasty revisionist fish fry fundraisers movie screenings 90sthemed nights with tons of sega and nintendo games pig roasts brick oven pizza cookoff competitions and even dance parties on schoolbuses outback
also once the night event start its impossible to have a conversation with anyone at your table even if youre sitting in the restaurant section
i happen to be a grilled cheese sandwich fiend and can vouch for their sandwiches i always ask for cheddar
for around 4 each you can build your own own tacos with their list of meats and toppings and grab a drink for around 7 from their selections of different margaritas whisky cocktails and other libations
the curds yes at least there were curds were bland and the fries didnt hold their crunch for more than a minute
they opened a new location on rainbow yea
i was really excited to get another asian option in southend
then he notices that i am down to the last 13 of my beer
i highly recommend
i do not have the vocabulary to express how good the food is
mains we had  green curry with chicken  red curry with vegetables and tofu  fried rice the mains were a little bland the fried rice was the best of the three i tried there were more on the table
worst fattoush ive ever had and i get it anywhere that offers it
we had a bad experience overall will not return
run do not walk to these
he says we asked her to take a break thats why shes being escorted outso i responded the other security guard didnt elude to that at allthe way it sounded is that she was being thrown outi wouldve been fine with that explanation if it was initially provided
bun for the burger was great but the burger patty size was a joke
we were so full but our server highly recommended the sticky toffee bread pudding which was their specialty and since we were on vacation we couldnt turn it down
was never acknowledged
being just down the street and having a large group of friends in walking distance it was was way too easy to show up with 20 people and just take over the bar
oh and theres a dj
loves im the sushi chef at home and i make fresher and tastier sushi than a restaurant up the road from me
it was very difficult to stay awake until i had time to digest
the service here is pretty great despite how busy it was when we went
the wine pours seemed a little skimpy at first but by the time i had the madeira i was doing just fine
im not sure if its a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their piano and a young lady singing
weve had brittany in particular as a server our past few visits to the book and shes aces
long over due review  spent new years here with the family and it was awesome  nice view  great staff and absolutely delicious food  cant remember all the dishes we ordered since we ordered so much food from steak to seafood  a few bottles of wine  just a great time and everything was just great  enjoy
would try it again
not just a little burnt but burnt
this was a treat
the space is nice
this place was great
a spicy italian hoagie for dinner a generous portion of italian meats fresh cut mozzarella on a fresh italian roll what you expect of a good italian hoagie
came for restaurant week add the wine pairing to our meal
so here goes i used to work next door to fez up until the end of 2007  ive been several times and i have never been disappointed with my food
park on freemont was seriously one of my favorite places we visited in lv
you cant beat the charming atmosphere and lovely views
my friends and i stayed and talked and ate for 2 12 hours  there was absolutely no pressure to leave
ive had various items at the different carts all of which seem overpriced and under seasoned
the restaurant is clean and cozy and gorgeous to boot
well my first experience the old york was for breakfast
just poor customer service
lol you gotta be kiddin me i know what that tastes like and theres no teriyaki bowl teppanyaki here
the food is outstanding
the booths surround the dance floor roped off
the oysters were particularly spectacular
and the avocado milkshakes oh man
it was complexboth dry and semisweet at once with a distinct honeylike flavor that i loved
i have a few friends that rant and rave about this place but i honestly found it to be okay
third time w the shrimp pizza
very good mexican street food
my friend ordered the vanity martini which is a gin martini rimmed with pop rocks one of my favorite childhood candies
last time i was there the experience was nothing that made me want to go back or even stay and finish my pizza
i even see a craft rootbeer tap and would bet the ranch there is ice cream in the house
place seemed nice until the end
it was tiny and cramped and not too mention very poor lighting
we walked in without a reservation and lucked out with a seat in a cramp corner right next to the bar
i wont be back
the assortment of fresh bread was very filling which came with meal
beer selection could be better but its what you would expect from a steakhouse
when we found out we had a table waiting for us at nobu i was ready to go and feast myself on its delights
more often than not you get people singing along or congratulating you on a good job or good song choice after the fact
the initial experience was nice but a few things bothered me
the fish tacos were regular ole fish tacos nothing special
overall nice presentation good quality for price
the food is prettty good but the value is the best
smug employees  clientele and fantastic coffee
lots of good food and one of the cleanest asian buffets that ive ever seen
i liked that part
the food is good the salmon fate is excellent
great concept of starter locations for small businesses
i highly recommend trying this place if you havent yet
we were amazed by the selection of games and how everything ran like a well oiled machine
we spent around 40 dollars which bought us a lot of a really good food
great prices on food and drinks
beef stragonoff was oh so good
she then was super confused why
good music not modern stuff just nicely done covers of top 40s stuff that you will appreciate of you are anywhere from 2540  the age range in that place hovers around there too
try it see if you agree tell me if you do
however halfway through i had to stop eating it because it was way too cheesy
i feel like the menu is a japaneseitalian fusion
we all know their lunch specials are the bomb especially the bento boxes
not the best stacks ive had but they were really delicious nonetheless
its pretty expensive for thai food though
these were lebron jamess eyes
the  drinks were alittle on the light side but o would still recommend the peach moscato or the russian mule
they have daily happy hour specials dont miss wednesday night mojitos
our waiter from white plains ny was very enthusiastic
about ten minutes later after my friend had finished eating another server delivered the mac n cheese
no nasty tap water served
i really like this place that i go nearly every weekend when i am in town
sparing any friesranch lovers because they have no ranch
it can book up well in advance but for a great dining experience its definitely worth it
graffiti deconstructed the classic sandwich with juicy pork french toast berry perseveres and some cheese sauce that i wanted to lick off the plate
the only downside to this is that all of the foliage made it extremely difficult to locate the building
as a result its not the best place if you want to chat wit your date or a friend
milkshakes sake sangria fried calamari and grilled loche duarte salmon burger are just some of the new items that are new additions to the bachi lineup
the service was excellent and the portions were huge
we got seated fast only 3 tables being served
the chef came out to apologize again and told us they were now going to fire him
if hearts fc are at home the place has a great atmosphere pre and post match
we were on a tight schedule for good dining and a show to catch
as long as you put in at least 10 into the machine you get a free drink
as a note the glass washer is in the back so theres no madnesssteamvrooming in the bar area
our table had the peppered tuna sirloin tips gorgonzola chicken and lobster  shrimp mac and cheese
great friends  dinner  music and dancing
fries nooooo this was a major downfall
has that ever happened in the history of restaurants ever
the servers are a cool and attractive bunch as well
extensive wine selection
people around our table were waiting for a hour for food
upon checkin we were asked if we were celebrating anything special and my husband told them how id spent all of my time with a loved one
all in all if youre in the area and you are desperate for pho then this may just be the best you can get
from start to finish they made us feel so special i thought maybe they sat the wrong people or something
cant wait to regain appetite for dinner
bread is thick cut italian no other option
i think next time they mail in a coupon ill pass
two choices having tried both the classic standard cooked medium rare gets my vote
did not try hibachi grill but it looked good
sushi way   so glad she had the report to do
are you kidding me
the food was left unfinished and now we are going to eat street tacos
will not be back
well certainly not me
however our service hosts themselves were very friendly
unfortunately the place wreaked of cigarette smoke and old booze
happy eating
this place is fun
id suggest exploring other nearby options
im not really a big eater but there was plenty for lunch as well as enough to save for a snack later
i will say that even after crap service she put 20 gratuity on our checks without any kind of warning
its nice that they serve complimentary garlic bread as my daughter went through an entire plate of that by herself and she is no big eater
the orzo salad was solid but could have been a little bigger one of my coworkers ordered the artichoke dip which was really more of a hummus texture
who doesnt want to eat sushi in the wee hours of the nightmorning
it was pretty dead when we went here on a weekend night to have dinner with one or two other tables of people eating here
tasty and healthy a winning combo
for myself i had a shot of jack daniels a coors light and a pound of wings
we head over to the espresso island but see nothing breakfast related on their lcd menu screen
the restaurant is comprised of thoughtful detailed designs
there must have been a bad leak in the ceiling as i have noticed for the last month or so half of the ceiling is missing sheet rock
also prepare to get really really inebriated
average quality buffet sushi
i would never return and i would never recommend it
we had the sweet potato and the madison chicken sandwiches and both enjoyed them very much
there are too many good restaurants that give good and consistent service
i got the ribs  you could have made shoes from the leather they added two tablespoons of coleslaw a tablespoon of corn and a scoop of potato salad and called it something mexican
i had another coupon and gave it away
i am curious to know where that chef learned to cook like this
the second time i went the menu changed slightly
i do like that tarbells is a nice change of pace from most of the upscale restaurants in town that specialize in steak
i will be back
my sister and i came here for lunch and ordered from the set menu which was quite limited but the goal was just to get some ramen
such a little place one sushi chef kc he knows how to rock those sushi took a long time for it to come out other than that we are happy
we waited an hour for a table with a 9pm reservation
the older i get the more i realize that id rather just pay for a good meal than unlimited refills of a bad meal
the only way 4 people could sit there is if they were 4 five year olds
at 630 in the evening not much business which makes some sense as coffee time was a bit passed
disons que les poissons du fleuve saintlaurent ne se portent pas tous trs bien  la confection de sushis
the cole slaw was straight out of the can
i am a huge sushi critic and let me tell you hirobas chefs know what they are doing
patio and vibe are cool our waitress was very friendly but had to keep apologizing for the bar and kitchen  wrong tacos came out
i come back regularly and have no hesitations about trying new things here
i had the fish tacos and while it was a huge portion and tasty they were a bit too greasy
5 star for service
such a shame cause the burgers here are actually tasty
on a hot day here its hot
the burgers were so good
it is a game system so it isnt a typical driving range although i guess you could make it that if you wanted
i ordered the kobe beef tacos and the pulled pork sandwich
we were a party of 10 and we got seated right away
i finally had one girl notice me and was eager to get my check and leave
at least the last time i was there it was cash only but they have a convenient atm located near the bar
the only thing worth a hell of beings was the buffalo mac and cheese which it arrived with about 6 of them to eat
the cole slaw is great and i do love the potato pancakes
the manager came out introduced himself and gave me his number
very good lighting and ambiance
it made my nose tingle and got a few sneezes
nice gf options
not sure what the night crowd is like
my wife had osso buco and she enjoyed it pretty much
matt bartender manager is awesome
boring  the wrap was ok  three men  each with burger  fries and still hungry when we left
i have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan
the bruschetta was incredible
not the cheapest price wise but the food is great and service is good
they served us food and we left and will probably not come back
after a moment we were treated by the executive chef who happened to be passing by and noticed us standing there
thank you so much
good luck native
35 stars as the name suggests this barcafe is located at the intersection of dundas and carlaw streets
never will we come back here again
anyway you gotta love a place where theres peanuts in the shell on every table and you can order breakfast any time of dayor night
love to dance there
the film wasnt great but thats not the theatres fault
one of the pasta dishes had green chiles and a white sauce
mention this post and have a drink on me
oh yeah and the pool is the bomb
i got their hot wings
or maybe it was the under counter lighting strip that had fallen at some point and remained unnoticed   hanging down randomly and glaring at me throughout the evening
rule 1 the customer doesnt care what is wrong
ordered the eggs benedict which is served on a round polenta cake i say cake because the polenta was more cake like sweet and creamy at the same time it took the place of the typical starch of the english muffin it came with a nice poached egg and candian bacon on top you get 2 servings along with a side of steamed asparagus
the young gentleman filed up barley tea and water at half point or higher all the the and was attentive
so i was dreading my visit
i will say after two years of living in charleston i am biased but i know im not alone
tuna served having never been bled  any fisherman knows you bleed a tuna otherwise you get the taste of rotted blood
the kicker was and perhaps there could be some argument on this one i started out ordering a glass of wine  the fidelity merlot  and once it arrived was so offput by one sip by the incredibly chalky earthy dirty taste of it i after saying i never do this sent it back and asked her recommendation for a replacement that was lighter etc
i probably ate more than 3 dozen raw oysters by myself and 30 something sweet shrimp plus many more
the sushi here isnt really anything to right home about
you can sit in one of the booths inside for hours play cards and talk or you can sit outside on their patio during nice weather
i check out the menu every time i go even though i always order the same thing and its very eclectic
we will definitely be back
the wine selection is really above average and the beer selection offers local craft beer selections
the bar and tv setup looked good and service to the bar patrons seemed fast
chicken was moist and so was the catfish
each meal comes with a house salad red andor white house wine garlic bread and a cappuccino
this is a tiny bar on the second floor of the royal york modelled after and the same size as a train car
given that it was a hot day it was super refreshing and a good pickmeup
they currently have 31 beers on tap
it tastes so good
i havent been in the actual rooms here so take my review lightly if youre planning on booking a stay here
so comfy no one wants to get up   this time my visit was during a sunday brunch slot
the price is very good especially considering how large their rolls are 5 for a huge vegetarian roll
i dont know what kids because there is only one high chair in the joint and they do not offer anything but water for children who dont drink soda which is anyone younger than 10 in my opinion
on sunday the hostess told us we had a choice between the buffet and ordering off the menu
ive been surprised the food is actually good here
got the salmon and it was good but not anything to yell about
a return to bei is a definite maybe though i fear it may only confirm my feelings that this restaurant is trying to be too many things and succeeding at none of them
steak and eggs was delicious and reasonably priced
youll have your choice of other summer favorites like the panseared red trout presenting a generous flaky mild filet no bones with a seasoned crust youll flip over
ahhmazing 2 crop corn with flash sauteed peppers and onions with balsamic drizzle
the food is amazing
the food was so good i wish i can have it everyday
best pizza in town imho not a big papa dels fan
for 24 a complete waste
luckily we found a cabbie in a del taco parking lot that took us back
i go to the parkview for one event and thats reggae brunch and its very good timei can say the bar staff is very fast at getting your drinks and they get you drunk real fastthe only draw back are the bathrooms because the place was so crowded they all became coed
between the three of us we had cod perch or bluegill
if youve read my other reviews you know i have a serious relationship with olives especially on my pizza
way too much bread for this sandwich takes away from the yummy bacon flavor you expect from a blt
apps we had   salmon tartare very fresh salmon mixes well with the mango  volcano roll also fresh salmon really cruchy tempura bits and thin layer of rice  gyoza homemade and bursting with juicy flavour  seaweed salad just the right amount of crunchiness and awesome dressing all of the apps were great but the clear winner for me was the volcano roll
overall i probably wont be back if i want to grab a burger i will definitely go to gordan ramsays restaurant down the street cheers
ive gone several times and had to pay for the free parking
i heard some people complaining about the slow service and the credit card terminal being uncooperative
great drinks and the bartenders are really cool and nice
the big screen playing casablanca silently in an endless loop was a rather outre touch
anyway just save your hard earned moneygasoline   2195 lunch or 2695 dinner after 4pm because there are tons of japanese restaurant for just sushi rolls or sashimi in la
my friend who lives out there took bf  i to dinner here since her  her bf eat here all the time
my tablemates specifically kazi h  okay really just kazi h would get a new bucket of ice and promptly drop it and we kept running out of garnish but they refilled everything with a smile
so delicious and tender
i barely had a sip
but i say its still bright pink in the middle to which she says well actually that means its well done
the place is cute and cozy great atmosphere
i look forward to returning on a nonlive show night to see what this place is like with the back room offering the full array of bar room funtivities  perhaps they will make me forget the smoke and offer up a fullfledged five stars
i love this place and every time i am in vegas i find myself going here
ive tried literally half the menu and plan to try the rest soon
finally after about an hour i got my water
each server introduced themselves as hi my name is x and ill be your server until y gets back from her break
a definite must for all to check out
we answered honestly and said that it had way too much dressing so one of the bussers tried to get it taken off of our bill and notified our server
this is the closest to israel you get without leaving las vegas  lol
damit kann man die speisekarte hoch und runter essen
service really sweet and friendly staff
great for relaxation but bad for the bank balance as it often means that a quick drink turns into several more
will definitely come back
got lucky and were seated by the bar
the 2nd time i had a honeydew milk tea
kinda pointless to juice and suck down pesticides
the food is basic but cheap and plentiful and while the beer isnt always absolutely topnotch at 1 a glass its very hard to argue against it
all i could taste was margarita mix
the last thing they would want to do after crafting over a cocktail for a large amount of time is to hear some dude sticking his arm thru the guests asking for a miller lite
the gumbo was waaaay to salty
my husband and i love coming here for hh to download from the day
during some very busy rushes there was only one waiter and one busser for the entire restaurant
i liked the energy of the place and how excited the imbibers seemed however im torn i want to rate it a full four but then i thought of the loudness and also the ok food
semi circular booths and tables are all very comfortable
i didnt find anything unique on the menu its a pretty standard run of the las vegas funny roll names you find everywhere with a few chefs specials
not a knock on the place the food and wine just wasnt worth a return visit given the price
definitely can tell that the chefs care about what they place infront of you from the quality and taste of the foodcant wait to be back to chill on the patio and try other dishes although im not crazy about one of the servers who was slightly rudeish but his coworker  was the exact opposite and very friendlyso im not going to hold it against the place just yet
the shrimp was also very peppery and i could only eat a couple of them
this is a review for the wine room
had the buffet with omelet and pumpkin waffle option from the kitchen
we set the baby up in his high chair and the waitresses are so attentive and nice
dont use the yelp  get directions it will take you on a wild goose chase to town center drive and a left turn on to garden mist drive which is a residential neighborhood
the portions here are gargantuan
only to come up to a place with tiny parking lot jammed wvalet parking only so good sign place is very cool looking loud would suggest some noise cancelling options like area rugs or ceiling wall padding very granola like feel reminded me of portland and seattle a bit wooden tables beautiful central vase wamazing fresh flowers plain bar
its like finding a hidden treasure
she was able to try so many different ciders and gluten free beers and nick was able to help her with each drink
again alex the host came through and gave us some of their desert moonshine as samples which led us to order their peach cobbler and chocolate bacon raspberry cake
i ordered 6 chicken wings thinking i would get 6 wings but i really received 12 when i split them in half and america somehow has the bad rap for overfeeding people
we did our fair share of gambling being that im a student and super broke
a few minutes later our drinks were poured and set up at the waiters station to be delivered
first the sushi was excellent and very reasonable priced
drinks took forever ordered a mai tai and received a glass full of sweet  sour
i have been to postino wine bar before which is somewhat similar
it was as if the fatgrease from the burger had all diffused into the neighboring territory of the bun since we had dry burger and way too greasy bun
he once ordered a white russian and even though ive never really liked that cocktail this one was on point
why dont some parents ever control or discipline their screaming and rambunctious children especially in public
buffalo wings 12 of course everywhere we go we the beau always has to get buffalo wings
its amazing and ill gladly make the drive anytime im wanting awesome food and service
we decided to stop in after lunch
needless to say it was a fantastic opening event experience which not only reflects well on the owners and staff of the upton but on me as well
i think because they were car i up a fresh coconut to serve it in
most appalling was our service
its like once they serve your food they forget all about you
wonderful mussels plentiful and a nice broth
luv their burgers
it was a beef stir fry with cashews and a bowl of rice
i saw a couple deals that i want to take advantage of but until that time comes
i had the kilt lifter 8th street and the stout
i asked for the manager and a guy with dirty finger nails and tshirt said he was the supervisor
she was not the least bit snotty
these are common issues at sushi places like this
i had the lox and chive waffles
the the service and food was very good
the chunk of cheese was really small though and for 5 i would think slightly more was warranted
it was happy hour so all of the shots were doubles for the price of singlescool
have eaten numerous times
the filet was exceptional
roll was fantastic along with the tempura snow crab
to describe their menu id say a modernized vietnamese restaurant with lots of different phos side dishes and specials
the salad bar is sparse and not very apetizing
polite and lovely waitstaff usually dressed in traditional japanese robes
chef really took control of the whole restaurant giving orders to the nice serverand make sure everyone are happy just love how the chefcook are there to have full interaction with all the patrons
mitchells has really stepped up their game since my last visit and i will certainly not wait another 2 years to return
go get a famous binion burger while you are there
there was some drunk fools who couldnt handle their liquor but security takes care of them
i have to say this wasnt as great as i remember
tourists especially the younger crowd will have a hard time dropping that kind of money for this type of venue
it was very tasty and i enjoyed it the whole afternoon
on wednesday nights they also offer trivia which is a lot of fun
this place is so much fun
treat you like you matter
it is pace salsa and the chips taste like they are bought in bulk
walking around birkdale wanting to try a new restaurant we passed fox and hound
the waitress was so easy to speak with and really made the right choice for me
best part of the whole experince
very tasty bbq sauce on the side
besides the name another reason i like the red squirrel is for the cider and beer  there is great selection of yummy beverages from thistly cross to blue moon and it is a great place for afterwork gossiping with friends
i just really feel like this club needs new management and hopefully someone whos young and with the program
my boyfriend and i both got the corned beef hash
i found this very tacky especially because they claim to be an upscale mexican restaurant
i tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so i asked her for a plate which she brought over right away
any restaurant with the confidence to offer a omakase or moriawase probably has a proud and fresh selection of sashimi to offer
worst service i have ever had
this casino has only been open about a year or less and it has a look of class
yes other places have better pizza well only one other place in tempe does and thats my pie and others places have better this and that but la bocca does nothing poorly nothing
i went here looking for a low key place to get drinks with some friends as it should be at a dive bar like patties but unfortunately the night before thanksgiving everyone else was doing the same
i was a guest of the owner and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional japanese presentations and contemporary twists
excellent food beautifully presented
always ask what the food special of the day is as they always have one
they added a sushisalad bar along with their all you can eat
all of the video game tables were occupied so ill have to get my mortal kombat on another time of which i am sure there will be many but i did get to enjoy some pop up pirate and battleship
i believe there is good seating in the day but they move all the tables and chairs to make space for more people
i live 10 blocks away from the one in manhattan and this new location did it justice
i like how it is open late too
but great foodl
the service has always been good
this place is fabulous
please make this work
wont be back
chef loves fresh herbs and used along with crisp  black olive bits shallot and a vinegarette that compliments rather than overwhelmed
also the the cookie desert and have been getting it for years
kris and i have been here several times now and weve got nothing but great things to say about this place
kind of sucks that budweiser products are a part of the offering insert gag reflex here
they even have no lots of items you may want for a bachelorette or bachelor party
well some of their other menu items come with cilantro
only warmed up a bit
over priced food for no reason at all
if you happen to find yourself in millvale you will also find yourself surrounded with more bars than you know what to do with
it could be made a bit better by adding just a little more spice to it but otherwise it was great
i was hoping the grease meant nommy guilty butter and fat dripping down my face
the waitresses are cute
at i sushi it comes only with a rice and lettuce salad
price is reasonable for food and drinks alike
we ordered sundae for dessert half melted when it was served
thank you dw bistro for the amazing food service and atmosphere
das ambiente ist super entspannt auch wenn der tierkopf an der wand fr mich eher geschmacklos ist
idk the name but it was some belgium ale
i recommend this place and kudos for having this business downtown
at the beginning of me coming to this restaurant they would take a very long time to bring out your food but as time has gone bye they are now very quick to serve what you order
the shakes are good tasting and a bit creative although at 11 dollars are a bit on the expensive side
dng is very comfortable and excluding fridays and saturdays its always easy to get a table
jammin jalapeno and caribbean jerk could use a little more refinement in getting that flavor right
fun outdoor patio complete with sand a pool and cabanas
i fully enjoyed my experience here
despite that when my kids are whining and im on my 4th load of laundry i just promise myself a trip back by the end of summer and cheer right up
seriously venetian has to go a step back and take some customer service classes
as a japanese native i have very fond memories of how my food tasted while i was growing up
wow read this
we were able to grab seats before we finished our first beers
was a bit taken aback by the fact that that its glued to a strip club but its a super nice place so no worries
they never answered their phone which was fun to find a way to get in touch with them about their food and lack of service
four peaks is one of my favorites
the menu at this atrias is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical
friday night karioke is just not my thing but it does get a crowd
if there is one restaurantbar in the madison area that will provide the true madison experience this is the place
our servers have always been very friendly and helpful
it tasted like jello mixed with grounded graham crackers which isnt bad but not exactly something i would eat repeatedly
friendly if inefficient servers the outside patio bar upstairs is quite nice
it was just okay
my only other gripe is they only have one tier of the family style now where as before there were three tiers the only choice includes a lot of food and is a mix of the top two tiers
we went on a sunday after church there where about 10 diners and i was amazed to see a full conveyor belt of sushi
they let everybody wait for about 20 min even with appointment
entrees 511 httpwwwcamelbackinncomdiningpdfhoppinjackspdf order inside and eat outside
splurge and go have some fun
my review is geared towards likeminded diners
what i love about fruits and roots is its knowledgeable staff the fact that it offers samples before purchase and a super convenient drive thru if youre on the go
i can probably eat 2 or 3 servings of this salad
the dora was excellent
the only ding i have to this place is the service
the salmon was cooked very well with a slight crust all around but still tender inside
i really enjoy visiting here
ive been for dinner several times and every time its just been the best experience
we actually only waited about 12 the time they quoted us  and the atmosphere was so enjoyable it didnt feel like waiting
perfectly seasoned the chilled tendrils will slide right down
but the margaritas are good
the first time eating here was fine no trouble with the food and service but this time around they really dropped the ball
we got spicy salmon roll spicy california roll sashimi dinner combo chicken karagee and crunch noodle
being a nonaz visitor obviously i was in love with sitting outside by the firepit in december
waitress messed my bill up three times but we worked out in the end
the waiter was nice enough to let us split a martini
no firearms allowed
on top of that our friends knew mario batali personally from new york which was known by the waiter
as an added bonus to us and all the other guests mark gave us the bird as we walked down the sidewalk past the bar
i have a huge appetite and the box filled me up
phil carol is a great bartenderhost
great spot in vegas
when we ask for the bill she just dropped it and left
when it started to get busy a while later the service did slip a bit which was a shame but i think something easily fixed
first impressions were not good because they totally mishandled my reservation for 7pm
this was the place i was most looking forward to eating at in vegas
no further comments nor apparent concern
however im happy for people in chandlergilbert that we finally have a ramen place to try but unfortunately it just isnt the authentic kind
atmosphere was very nice and we sat in the balcony seating which was very unique
they serve ice cream at the end and the black sesame one is really good
maybe if i would have taken a look at the food menu i would have gotten a better idea but i left after one cocktail which i had no complaints about
for the entree i tried steak and egg sea scallop fry and the braised lamb  eggs
came with a group for dinner burger for dinner really
my two sides was a salad and a salad
some of the standouts include the wisconsin brat burger a seasoned pork burger on a pretzel roll with spicy kraut relish and swiss cheese and the fish and chips no explanation needed
i had a ball on my first visit to geisha
itd fill you up
we sat at the bar and had great service
when i go on the weekdays if i do it is much better and i at least walk out with something
there is a nice bricked patio out front
im broken without it
its all in the toppings and the preparation of the meats
supreme bento box all the way
we ordered a burger a turkey burger and a couple drinks during lunch
stares at customers
leaves more room to try new things here
they remember what my husband and i like to drink and they are genuinely friendly
not sure what happened to the chefs we knew but lunch was disappointing
some of the best ive had in long time
a local favorite in old town
eric our waiter was unaware of the situation so he grabbed his manager myles colbert
others had the ahi tuna which was cooked perfectly rare
when my friend emerged from making fudge dragons the bartender said i hope you cleaned up after yourself
their nigiri though is a little heavy on the rice
i told our server the chicken wings were the best i have ever had and ive had more than my fair share
it was 90 fat and gristle
waiter always making excuses  food not as good as in past
no he brought it out in a pint glass and said  we dont  have any copper mugs sorry the glass felt like it was just out if the dishwasher and needless to say the ice melted quickly and my drink was watered down
they gave us some bread to start out with it was okay
oh lord jesus it was fantastic
it was a surreal experience for sure
i ate here with my boss and the food was good
the fries are soooo yummy
also only minor beef  served the caprese last  thought that should be the 1st item to be served
we ordered the red pepper hummus which was pretty good
he cooked our meat to the correct temperature while entertaining us
this place is popular so maybe it was good at one time
i looked at the menu and decided to go with the philly cheese steak rookie move
i also ordered a carne asada taconot good at all the meat was so fattyi did not finish it
ice masks the pineapple coconut taste
our server was jenna and she was super sweet
they also have their own soda which is fantastic and fun to try
bartenders are friendly and mix up a good drink
when the waiter says  would you like some edamame to nibble on while you look over your menu does not translate to free edamame
some of them will party with you too if you just ask
10 minutes later we received the tab
nothing to rave about but it gave me lots of feelings of nostalgia
overall we left very satisfied not super filling but super super delicious
this lounge was very clean and later back
i like the outdoor patio
my only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat
the casino itself kinda sucks poor slot machine selection
not great and not horrible went for lunch with my wife
my burger was cooked perfect but it came without any condiments
so i wound up at the breadfruit with the yelp az international supper club my 1st time and glad i went look forward to many other eating adventures to come
the happy hour drinks were great and affordable 4 sangria
still the atmosphere was nice and dinnering was wonderful here
wow this potato isnt that good
as we were driving from northwest past summerlin to southwest i kept refreshing yelp to find near locations
even the sashimi was meh
given all that i will be back maybe try a mixed drink or something
i did appreciate that as i kinda expected she would forget
we both enjoyed the hopped whiskey and their small batch four grain whiskey as well
casey moores is like one giant house party but with much better people and much better beer available
if you havent tried this place yet get there pronto you wont be disappointed
its more family restaurant style food then pub fair but a great selection
and then we bumped into dann shushi no idea about the significance of the extra h
however food is bland
to say i was impressed with the knowledgable and friendly staff would be an understatement
asu roll is good
the girls who work at this location are mostly college girls and dont have a bad attitude
the waitress kept them coming
i never actually saw them take away anything that had been out for to long in my opinion
beer still 175 ribs still cheap with players cards wait still sucks but hell 2 outta 3 aint bad
the sauce was spot on
im sure this review will be erased but ill keep posting it and the same thing on every other review site
not sure i would come back there
we shared the fried chvre the bread platter comes with delicious honey butter pork belly with delicious mustard asparagus scallops wish these tasted a little more truffley and the ny steak
would recommend if you love sushi
i ordered the field greens
overall worth checking out
i always hit the venue an hour early to grab dinner before the show
the ice cream was really only okay
their happy hour is great lots of food and drink specials but we were especially thrilled with our meal
we went to olives to celebrate my birthday
die bar ist keine richtige bar es ist den wir haben uns spter an die bar gesetzt wurden aber nur am rande beachtet und zum teil vergessen geschweige denn das man mit uns ein wenig geplaudert hat wie es sich an der bar gehrt
stop in order a genes brew take in all that is genes place
did i mention theres jenga on every table
went there for the first time and had terrible service
the staff is wonderful and the bar is very knowledgeable
im very jealous there isnt something like this where i live in raleigh
the food was delicious the waitstaff attentive and the prices totally worth it
when the game starts the waiters turn the tvs on to the game and broadcast it throughout the restaurant
home away from home
yesi said sturdy walls
we were told 20 minutes and waited almost an hour
had a wonderful steak
one of my favorite places to eat at in cleveland
the mill street brew pub is in a great location but there can be a wait at times
okay so the guitar looking drinks the cowboy boot and all the other flask drinks is what caught my attention
absolutely love this new restaurant
also my server took my plate with wasabi on it as soon as i put the last piece of sushi in my mouth which really bothered me since i wanted to still have wasabi with my last bite
timing and service aside from our main server was weird over the course of the night 3 other people dropped food and drinks at our table and i do mean dropped
an aside the view is freaking ridiculous
i also got barbecue homemade potato chips
i was actually a fan of this dish surprisingly
make reservations this place is small and fills up nightly
again i was the first and only in line
loved the outdoor patio with live music on wednesday
imagine how horrible it would be for anyone to sit down after we had left and grab some of the sushi that had likely been there for an hour or more
loved this club
their potato and leek soup was delicious and full of fresh perfectly cooked red potatoes and delicately fried leeks
next we had the chicken and beef hotpot
the store was clean and well organized but not enough to bring me back in for another smoothie
if you do need to order something id recommend the pierogies
they should have kicked me out for walking in here with hospital scrubs on luckily they were kind enough to let me be and allow me to stimulate the local economy
tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out
we came in for dinner on a weeknight
i was salivating as i read it but what i got was an under spiced piece of thin fish from frozen
this visit 180 and 2 hours later
while i admit that it was hard to swap plates on this one because i was so crazy about the tender juicy hangar steak i was also pleased with the salmon
i recently stayed here for a tradeshow i was attending nearby
the right sideagain same menuis walkup service you place your order at the counter and youre given a number to display on the table of your choice
the pork belly bun is my absolute favorite incredibly delicious
their sushi is amazing
so only 4 stars because some of the prices are a little high
cant wait until my next trip
i love the lychee mojito here such a unique flavour for mojito and of course being asian why wouldnt i love lychee
cant believe i didnt find this place earlier
plus the mashed potatoes were cold and wasnt even served any gravy with it
waitress who was suppose to be tending to us was flirting with a group of men
otherwise the food was quick and the fries are pretty good
the food is junk
you had the option to get it with or without alcohol which i thought was really cool and you also had a wide range of choices
then the waitress continues to tell us that they are out of almost everything on the menu
it was over priced and very generic
hats off to the chef
the crust was crispy and the pesto was full of flavor
the shrimp werent deveined
its always nice to see asian sushi chefs working the counters
be sure to get a manhattan with extra cherries
maybe i needed to purchase an extra shot
that sums about everything up
alec one of 2 sommeliers at cava provided great pairings to go with each  a late harvest smillon with the foie and a white sherry with the supergilda
the decor is awesome and has great ambiance and wait staff are friendly but the ramen failed this city as the arrow would say
the interior was fun and vibe upbeat
overall the food was not worth the money
bruschetta was so yummy
the view off the main patio was awful due to current construction
and i hate blue cheese
the dressing was tasteless and it looked like one of those side salads that are served along with entrees to appease customers
i think i got the wrong one because even once in a while i tasted a bite of bacon
i am still not a fan of the chatty teens at the front and all the workers except for one or two walk around with no smiles on their faces which would drive me crazy if i were their employer
i cant say enough good things about pacinos
loleverything was so good
the salad was spoton large portion dressing on the side with lots of toppings on a bed of micro greens
this place is great service is awesome everybodys been very friendly food is delicious got to try it
i had the honor and privilege of attending the soft opening for beauty and essex at the cosmopolitan last night
sauce that came with the fish was pretty good
the noodles were over cooked as well
i would hate to waste a precious night on an oldie but goodie if i can try out some place new
it was a nice gesture but im surprised that the hostess never apologized told us that she was offering a comp or took the opportunity to ask how they could improve the dish
this was my second visit to sushi rock the first was to the beachwood location 3 years ago
i didnt give it 5 stars because sometimes the servers are a little bit grumpy or dont speak english very well
where is the clean up staff
i loved this place in hawaii and went there twice because i knew i couldnt get what i wanted back in vegas but now that theyre here i can
always fresh and super tasty
the entrance is pretty grand with an elevator taking you up and beautiful pictures of people like dorothy dandridge and frank sinatra adorning the walls
there were more bouncers in the club then people dancing and having fun
the service almost always painful and painful to watch around me especially at an outside table
youve rescued sushi in medina
we had the raspberry lava cake and the strawberry tiramisu and some cream puffs
basically they just covered the tents with camouflage paper
understandably the food took a while to come out and the portion sizes are what you expect for the price
we were okay with this and dug in
i have not been to an establishment in over 10 years that refused separate checks
i am not sure how they make their pretzel dough but they are doing something right
cleveland has a lot to offer when it comes to dining out
lovely little pub
slightly overpriced for a street taco but still good
i grew up in the sw but have loved in the ne for 20 years
this place was awesome
the spicy chicken appetizer
chicken was good nice seasoning on skin moist insiderice perfect
pairing the passion of its chefowner with a sizable menu and plenty of wellsourced fish  howard chois fish n bowl is the sort of localsonly place that deserves the support of anyone interested in japanese cuisine the relatively low price point and cozy confines speaking to a world far removed from the touristy trappings of the strip
if you go to get wild which is the only reason to go be sure to get the puke insurance
our server was a doll our food came out quick and was delicious the live music was great and the regular music was good too
this might be the best pizza in arizona right now it is absolutely delicious
food was solid
ok very dark in the place the outside the trees and bushes were overgrown which covered up the windows not letting in much light
i can compare to many different ones i made myself or had at different friends houses in switzerland
i especially liked that the beans were not greasy
ive gone to almost all of the boba places around town hands down this is one of my favorite places
ill give it 3 stars for now i didnt try any food
lambiance se rchauffe plus tard dans la soire la musique devient plus rock ou folk et on est content de pass 1 heure ambiance dans un certain vacarme
i always gravitate to the onion rings or nachos
their pizza is also very tasty and i would recommend it especially the applewood chicken if you are looking for something to split between two people
i am so so so happy this place is so comfortable and smart and making a fun little strip up here on jean talon
i would say stay away give your money to a place that appreciates your business
as for my husbands enchilada it was gross
somehow we had room for dessert after seeing the dessert menu
i wanted to leave
the sugarcane juice is good it tastes great with or without lime or mint
tables and chairs not arranged to mingle at all
the food though is really good
the bartenders they were great and friendly guys who would talk and chat it up with me and the mrs no longer
however i wasnt expecting to here hard music about crack and hos
the staff is always very nice but arent necessarily the most efficient
part of the here experience
we were told the dishes are meant to share so im guessing they do this to make you order more
the pork belly also didnt lend much to the dish
to be fair we were headed to the hash house but had to leave because the wait was over an hour for breakfast
bottom line overpriced bad service shitty beer
maybe falafel it would be cool to have designer popcorn  flavored in spices or something while drinking tiki cocktails
there is a giant chalkboard that somebody spent a lot of time writing the signature dishes but the chalkboard is back in a corner so being a new customer with so much other noise going on i didnt even notice it until halfway into my meal
one day after being sick for a few weeks i thought id be adventurous and stop in for a fresh juice that might help fight the cold
as we walked in there were fire artists doing poi and fire dancing painted human statues models standing at every corner simply holding up small signs with the parties name a mermaid floating in the pool and on and on and on
even though my voice was jacked up from laughing my as off all night
hideous centerpiece and all
i then tried rosatis and now that is the real deal
the drinks are good i enjoy a mango pina colada on a warm day before i head to park
and the food smoked sockeye salmon greek yogurt caviar truffle honey  quite tasty and rich
the nordic shrimp plate was hands down the worst plate of food we ever ate in a restaurant
the halfstrawberry garnish was a little pale but made up for lack of redness with ideal sweetness and burstingness
i definitely wont be going back
that being said the customer service and music selection is  very thoughtful
los dos is the latter
i have hung out here several times and had dinner while waiting for flightsthe food is better than most you find in airport restaraunts and the drinks are good
the sandwich was actually very very good but be warned very very messy
their burger was amazing
capital grill rocks capital grill is great as always fantastic food great service wonderful patio too for patio dining in the winter in az
i did notice that they removed a lot of stuff on their menu
these are little gripes nothing that turns me off
lets just say spend some money and turn the ac on
apollos was a fun experience until i checked my bank account and find the erroneously overcharged me over 3500
nice place to take a dateexcellent service and the foods deliciousi didnt find it too pricey but thats a matter of opinion
not impressed with the way overpriced food and lacking customer service
mes rillettes de canard arrivent accompagnes de petits cornichons marins  laneth et dun grand bol de tranchettes de baguettes
on to the food
great drinks and carry out option was taken advantage of
their oyster shooters set the mood quite nicely for date night
they serve american tapas style food
i had the linguine with chicken and mushrooms in a cream sauce with a glass of white wine
oh and there was a random mix of music from kpop to timbaland so that was fun
otherwise the food was amazing
i was also super excited to learn that they have metropolis coffee
the desserts are soo delicious
we all got a burger
its a bar
s next door for truly awesome service terrific beers and great food
but no i arrived on time and was directed to a notsoloud room as requested in my reservation
very friendly and fast sushi chefs
the accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least they merely enhance the flavor of the fish
i think bathrooms are in the basement but i didnt venture down there so i couldnt tell you
we also ordered a mill street raspberry ale to share
for dessert we had the black and white chocolate cake
it was a very fun and comfortable atmosphere for a bar setting
but when its busy its really busy which leads to service sucking
we felt very unattended to and almost a bother to the staff
a must place to dine at
we also ordered chicken poppers for appetizers and there was no chicken at all
i also enjoyed the firecracker
i think the restaurant will get better as time goes on
ive been coming to this place since 2003 i must admit their prices has gone up and the portions are a bit smaller now
start out with a drink
all of our food tasted good but the antipasto  brussels were stand outs
it looses a star because it was so crowded
fantastic fajitas though the chips salsa beans soup  grilled veggies are a meal in itself
we can only hope that the service will be better the next time
i visited the restaurant on friday night and left pretty pleased
probably one of my new fave spots for sure
i have no hopes for it being open for much longer
to many other nice places to try in the area that are so much better
i heard about this place through triple d and since i was in the area i thought id give it a try
the water not being filled was irritating but not that big of a deal
went in there recently and they were pretty busy
lychee sorbet never disappoints
i feel this establishment is too pricey for the quality of food it serves but it can get away with these prices due to the unique experience it offers customers
they have pool tables and lots of tvs to catch the action
drinks here are second to none but the service could have been better
welp it was worth a shot but i would not return
they still wound up on our check
the bourbon room definitely caters to a specific niche market and more specifically fans of 80s music
the chandelier is interesting in that there are 3 different levels each with a different vibe and a separate cocktail menu
i subbed balsamic instead of the suggested dressing and opted to go no onions but they asked if i wanted to sub something else in instead of the onions  i passed but i like that they had the option
we ordered the korean bbq plate of meat good for 4 people for 7000 pros  we were full at the end and was more than enough fresh meats great tasting fun to cook your meats and eat it right off the grill friendly server  quick service  reasonable prices  cons no vegetables included
for what i thought was a small portion the taste of the fish made me forget about portion size and who am i kidding
we bypassed the appetizers we both got mortons salads which were huge
see you again soon
you get exactly what you see
theyre super funny and entertaining
theres patio seating although it was closed because it was a little cool outside
i would definitely return here when im in phoenix
there is a step from the parking lotstreet to the entrance
a little on the pricey side as far as lunches go my usual order comes out to 1076 with tax but a girl can only eat lean cuisine so many days a week before turning into a frozen food entre herself
my sliders were full price even though it was happy hour and the bartender who was nice granted turned up the tv after we told him we didnt want to hear the game score
one of the couples asked wow what was that you just gave us it was delicious
the prices here are fair and worth it
indifferent wait staff
and one of the four seaweeds you just had was made from algae not seaweed
fast forward to the sales transactionserver acknowledged two credit cards and repeated to us that he was going to split the check
i had to flag down the waiter darren to have it done over
service was ok kind of slow and far between but ok  will definitely go again
the tuna tartar was served with delish waffle fries that were lightly sprinkled with a red pepper
but it was cinco de mayo
i come probably 3 times a month
food was ok ordered hot wings but they were way too hot
it was 1050 for chicken with mixed vegetables that came with choice of soup and a spring roll
i went there a few weekends ago with a large group and we ordered a mix of dishes
thats what youre paying for
for lunch my boyfriend and i ordered the tuna carpaccio and lamb ribs for our appetizers
two of us sat at the bar he gave us 1 menu and didnt offer us drinks
the pt was quite yummy though it came with no crackers or even a slice of bread until we asked for our bread basket to be replenished
im a polish boy myself
smoothies are good just not great
i was excited to try the new summer shandy in grapefruit and it did not disappoint
we enjoyed everything that we ordered mussamun chicken curry pad thai pad prik khing and panang curry
go pack go
do not get all you can eat
great windows to people watch
the perfect amount of like to give it some flavor
service is fast and friendly
ive introduced this place to dozens of friends who have in turn introduced it to dozens more
my husband and i love that they have papago orange blossom on tap
i could try to describe the flavors but does it really matter
the volcano roll was drenched in mayo and sauce  my husband felt like he drank a bottle of mayo
she said they are kept in the cooler and then heated up briefly for an order
love the british options on both beverage and food menus
i do miss the desert ridge location but the food is consistently good at the original place
as others have noted the crowds are a turnoff and you would probably be better off at wasabi or edo
the second visit we had the 14 house thin crust pizza and 22 oz beer special
our table was greeted by the waitress who seemed to be quite kind
nick was especially very nice and welcomed us and made sure the food was perfect
1 star  because i cannot leave 0 poor service
its been done to death and now its officially just awkward
we liked the selection of taps and my girlfriend was excited that a local sparkling hard cider from arsenal cider house was on tap
after my dining partner gave me to them for the evening they all shared their food with me so i could taste more items on the menu that what we ordered
when i got their they wasted no time in getting me my order
i got my usual a black coffee and it was 200
i would definitely say the mozzarella was the hit of the night for us
servant kept on forgetting everything
will definitely go back and hopefully snag a patio table
certainly a place im proud to be duchess
bonus  they have solomons seal tea
at 1214 a small drink i wasnt expecting this
even though it was busy the had plenty of bar staff that was friendly
the day after the clubbing someone in the hotel shopping approached us again about free access to club prive after we told her about the whole situation she said the bracelets definitely work and gave us the managers number
i ask for the receipt and find the 2 charge for hot water and gratuity has been automatically included
my girlfriend and i love to walk fremont street
my boyfriend and i usually share an entree since entrees are usually served in large portions and i can never finish them on my own
the coffee  fig infused whiskey was just awesome and the yellow jamjar was really tasty combination of curry chartreuse and honey
also the service was spotty while every waitresses was very friendly our food arrived at various times and half our group finished their lunch before the other even received theirs
waited 15 minutes to first see the waitress let alone get a glass of water
i mean for cripes sake its a bar in a chandelier
returned at the appointed pickup timeno order
i have been here many many many times
the poblano pepper entree i ordered looked wilted not too fresh
we continued and she started getting really nasty now
the bun was on the big side so i pretty much took the top bun off and put it to the side and ate my burger with a fork and knife
i am fully aware that i live in a desert and sushi would be so much better if i lived by a body of water
i would highly recommend you this place for breakfast or brunch
the cover i suspect was for the bandive forgotten their name but they were very talented and kept the place jumping
the small bites came out soon after we placed our order for the bowls and were wonderful
i have never tried the food here but i can say they have a nice bar and lots of options
ordered and was told one hour for delivery
i ordered the tofu chorizo tacos and fried guacamole the first trip and the potato tacos the second trip
im glad they didnt have a mandatory tip
the food was tremendous the service was top notch and the brown butter old fashioned is easily the best cocktail i have had during a long and distinguished drinking career
our favorite place for out of town guests and date night
the only downside is of course the noise levels
you are loosing customers you idiots
the worse thing was that their portions are tiny and not satisfying
great bar atmosphere and also also great dinner experience for families
i was stuffed by the end of the meal and still longing to try more things
they have live music on wednesday night
it is by far my favorite place in cleveland
best local dive in the area
the tv monitors were all big and new so there was plenty of screen visibility no matter where you were sitting
my wife children and i eat there at least twice a month and continue to be amazed with the quality of the service and food
nice place to be
willl i come back here again
also ordered a cold tapas with salmon and trout they left out the trout and when we asked about it the waiter said oh we must be out  no they didnt take it off our bill or offer us something else
its so absolutely delicious
the beer selection is worthy and always changing
looking back i know we wont be returning any time soon
not all the restaurants were opened for breakfast which makes it a real struggle for a group of hungover starving girls the following morning
my date had the duck and it was good but the pork was unmatched
who wants sushi rice with chicken teriyaki
it was clear as the night progressed that we were being rushed although we had no idea why
great for a birthday or other special occasion
the only things  i will complain about is that is sort of half upscale sports bar and half casual fine dining sort of weird but it works for them
la fin le serveur a pris la peine demballer tous les restes dans des doggy bags avant de venir voir les trois personnes qui avaient pris un menu pour leur proposer leur dessert et le th alors que nous avions fini de manger en premiers un plat se mange plus vite que des sushis
great place to eat
close to 20 pieces of assorted sashimi on bed of rice
you dont know me so you might think 50 is a preposterous amount for a glass of wine
its very close kinda loud and very tasty
after a few sips my friends actually couldnt handle it anymore and forced me to chug all that remained since i have the highest alcohol tolerance and the aftertaste and burn in my stomach was just yeah
with so many options for eating theres no reason to return
its not your typical wine list
it wasnt very busy this time of night either so i dont understand why they took so long to help us
came in with a group for lunch
shortly after our drinks arrived and our food order was taken the chef came out
crispy brussel sprouts and kale combo goat cheese and balsamic drizzle
totally confused why she decided to make a problem when there was no problem
my son and i went here while waiting for my daughter in a concert
what an elegant establishment
also everyone here seemed to be welldressed 20 and 30 something professionals which is our crowd as well
i was with a large group and i forgot to take notes so this review will not be as detailed as usual
introduced to toronto restaurant rally sports bar  smokehouse at the toronto delicious show i was seduced by a jambalaya
prices were a little steep but where else can you get fresh east coast seafood
as always i like to start my reviews with a caption of the decor
i also really enjoyed the black cod
you can get them sweet or savory i highly recommend the sweet
8 for two makes this place a great quick fix
the service was friendly and our gal was pretty attentive
however the happy hour prices are around the whole restaurant minus the teppanyaki
i also cant say that they have anything for me to keep coming back for
great spot for sports and they have every beer under the sun
the first thing is flashed on was the bread
if someone said they were hitting it up and i had nothing better to do id go back with no complaints
the long island i consumed clearly was created from cheap alcohol blends and other than the delicious french fries this meal set a new standard for low
a couple of the dealers were so much fun and had great personalities
finding this ethnic vendor inside the public market was a delight especially since there arent really any other colombian places in the city
it will be fabulous in the summer
sashimi was good
so if you see them claiming to make up for awful reviews just know its probably just to look nice on the yelp page
the sushi rice i could eat on its own
i favor nigiri and the fish here has never dissapointed
they used to have a nice shrimp and grits typedish called shrimp diablo it was removed from the menu
the dining room was very noisy outside was much more peaceful and faced the bellagio fountains
the entire staff is friendly and the food is super yummy
tonight the veggies were organic baby carrots and fingerling pea shoots
the one time exception that i have not been able to push from my memory was for a friends birthday party
beautiful dining area
i used come back to you week after week
i love this spot
rudest bartender ever
i loved the rolls were ordered the dynamite roll was my favorite
the staff was nice but even for the convenience i cant justify the quality for the price
i did not see any of that but im certain my timing had a lot to do with that
ive never been to a restaurant with such bad experience
for dinner i had fish and my man venison
i cant believe my girlfriend and i payed 60 bucks for dinner
i was expecting something like milk  cereal from afters in long beach
theyre all worth a go i just lean towards darker liquors  definitely give it a shot
i ordered it only to be told 10 minutes later that it wasnt in season
the drinks were reasonably priced and they were the only establishment open late in downtown phoenix
we were looking for something healthy and kaboblike upon our arrival in lv
the seating is uncomfortable its too loud and the service wasnt good
sarcasm aside this place turned out classier than expected and if i squinted my eyes a bit i almost felt like i was in vegas until the cocktail waitress asked if yinz want a crab cake
my absolute favorite
while the food was adequate what made this such a great experience was our server
i wish i had someplace like this by my house in la
we come here either when we have guests staying in town or when were up real late and want breakfast
i highly recommend ordering from zen
theres nothing wrong with this place but it is a pub with average food
i took off 01 star because even though the music volume was perfect they were playing american pop music instead of japanese
thats my idea of a good time
the burrata was a little bland but i believe thats just how burrata is by nature
we just went for finger food but i have a feeling well be back this week to try a burger they looked yum
its an irish bar so was nice to see harp and other irish beers on tap stayed only for 45min then headed home
atmosphere was nice and warm
we ended up cutting things up and redistributing plates so all could try things but again i wish there had been more seafood in the dish
the entire wait staff was brand new like one day
we arrived at a reasonable time to be able to get a table around 4305 on a game night
they make it with an herb boursin and it should be on your bucket list of food to try before you die
would go again
maybe there should be another way to rate prices for breakfast places but paying 1215 a plate for breakfast is more than we expected for eggs benedict or a hash dish
they have the best bisquit and gravy and an amazing eggs benedict
it has a sweet yet sour taste
all in all this place was great
stopped by for lunch on a quiet saturday
the triple t fries are awesome
one of my favorites now actually
we had a great table that was by the pool
finally when our food did come some of it was cold and had a strong fishy odor
the service has always been decent
hell im probably pissing everyone off with this review
reasonably priced flavor so good i had to write a review
it was about taking care of the guest which the entire experience was missing
i got a frozen mocha it was ok the workers are friendly and you can tell they really care about their customers
it was absolutely delightful
the windows are open to the warm street on this charming little street corner and the conversations are varied and lively
you can scream or delight ppl with your voice no one is judging
both met our expectations
decor is something to see but the food is basic
i have noticed that that is a frequent complaint
we asked for tortillas with it instead of using the chips and the tortillas are so fresh i could eat them all day long
scary parking lot
not very exciting my second try to get here  the first time they were closed
eigentlich eine wirklich nette location mit schnem aussenbereich
5 away from the strip
we wait 30 minutes to sit
if you are ordering togo you can ask them to put the gravy on the side so that your noodles dont become one soggy mess by the time you get home
i mean im gonna start out by saying i was obviously here during shift change
coffee is delicious and the employees are very nice
great service
my family and i will probably not be coming back here
we didnt try the tapas but came for only a modest lunch and it was quite delicious
i saved 41 because when you check in using yelp you get 20 off your tab
i could care less about presentation and more getting enough food to feel full and the kicker is that the one ravioli cost 13
we arrived there a little after 1pm walked down into the bar and setup shop at the bar
its definitely a dive and its been there forever but the service and quality is top notch
waste of time in my opinion but was glad to get the advise
however expectations were not met
i know it said st louis but these seemed like a fattier babyback
the rest of the dinning experience our server was on point and very helpful and friendly
they were prepared with care with the sushi rice and sesame seeds on the outside  this would be at best a call in advance take out establishment
we ended up walking down 8 flights of stairs because we had already waited 20 mins and didnt want to wait any longer
the portion of steak tar tar was really large
good local band hosts and makes you pay for requests that are only beatles and says its for charity which it might be
staff was amazingly friendly
the yakatori was so bad i felt like crying
amazingly they remembered us from our first visit over a month ago and each of the crew came over to say hello and chat
atmosphere amazing
generally i think buffalo wild wings aka bw3 although the tmobile salesman pointed out to me that no one  calls it that anymore is well ok not great but i would normally put this in the meh category as i feel like they are over priced for what you get on any day but for their specials
if it wasnt for that i would have given a 5 star rating
personally i liked the crema as a sauce but my date liked the bbq so we both won
i wish the place was a little bigger
been here multiple times and i plan to go back
this was my absolute favorite dish
friendly staff good drinks decent food what more do you need
the menu is small and the prices a little high but for the convenience and quality its still worth it overall
overall i havent laughed that much during dinner while sober so i say its a pretty fun place to go to as part of a vegas experience
pretty darn good
im not sure why this place has received so many bad reviews
the only thing that annoyed me was the fans
i want that mix cd
moist fatty deliciousness overall great experience
i had the cheese plate it does come with meat but i asked for double cheese no meat and they had no problem with that
not too much food  but just enough to be filling
still a very good cut of steak
i was looking for some coffee and a desert and thought why not try this place with a great view of the strip
we ran into this place while trying to get back to our hotel but finding refuge from the cold
the filet mignon was wet marinated for 30 days
upon leaving and getting most of our hearing back we stopped at the vacated front post for the hostess in search of a business card or some contact information but there was none
the only thing i would advise is to not sit next to the swamp coolers on their patio
we have been fans of zeppes here in hudson for years but this was a huge disappointment
we will not return
it was an okay dinner meal for the conclusion of summerlicious 2016  service the server was very nice however unaware of the menu
i had the bruschetta and it was very yummy
the also have half a dozen taps of draft wine
on top of the delicious sticky bun was caramelized banana vanilla ice cream caramel whipped cream chocolate and a cherry
a hidden gem in scarborough for those that seek an alternative to the ayce restaurants
id prefer it in my pumpkin pie not my meatballs
the staff is so friendly and organized
i like this casino
fresh tortilla made this the best breakfast burrito i have ever had
i cant wait to go back even if its by myself at own little table
steak was great
an of course for the burger i went for their famous the melting pot and it was glorious
they have the recipes clearly outlined and ingredients there you just follow the instructions
nice place for a date night or private event
being fat is pretty depressing and shameful and i know people dont always want to ask skinny people for advice
ive visited frankies several times on vacation and its a must if youve never been here before
this location is much more hip and young compared to the other location filled with younger crowd from ryerson and eatons centre
then we got the bill
star 1 how were the service and atmosphere
well it didnt taste like a margaritait tasted like straight up tequila maybe thats why he thought it was special
yesterday i ordered catering again  same exact order as before
we ordered the soondae guk lunch special 799 the bulgogi bento lunch special 899 and the yukhoe 1799
everything was great as always
i love memphis  went to another location which was cleaner always one of our visits when we are in vegas
slightly in shock and not wanting to wait several hours for dinner we left and went to another locally owned restaurant that is interested in having customers
but all he did was to continue to talk to us in a condescending way
the service was great very relaxed atmosphere much quieter and cleaner than on easter
burger meh take it or leave it
not typical of claw chowder but not even 30 seconds later the mozzarella marinara came out
we showed up around 10 and since the tables were taken we jumped on a 7 foot table and played a few
always coming in strong with the herb omelettes
here at the house it was on the rocks
they do have a good selection of cocktails
talk about flavor
i was glad we split it because i couldnt have finished it myself
its just not my thing though
really wish i could give it the full 5 as it has amazing breakfast choices and delicious food but i wasnt as pleased the last time i went
calamari is always a crowd favorite
so im sorry if you encounter a douchebag chef but most of them are really nice
the kaffir had a nice subtle coconut aftertaste and was pleasant overall
das ist aber normal fr die gegend
the menu was typical pub food
service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for
no home cooking no restaurant quality food
needed crowd control and muliple stations set up
so this time i invited a work colleague
love the sushi hereespecially at their happy hour prices
the food is good but the bar crowd will definitely spill over into the dining section
btw the service was on point and you will come out full
i was craving their grilled cheese like crazy because its so good
the boy is very rude and always ready to pick up a fight
awesome beer selection ultra fast service service for a busy friday night
very cozy and friendly environment with self seating
im currently in love with anywhere that just has shelves of stock that you can choose to either purchase and take home or drink inhouse
wide selection of craft brews and cocktails
she told us no we cant have anything because we werent currently playing
the meat inside dry
lets start with what was most important the wings
the drinks are overpriced and under poured
the rice was not tightly packed and the tamago egg was tasteless
ive only ever been here on a friday or saturday night and its always packed and lively
it is like nothing ive experience in vegas before
they usually have trendy music playing at an appropriate volume and the chairstables are a hip stainless steel
it was 40 for us both tip included
the mai tai came with a flame which seemed pretty cool but the flame went out pretty fast
overall we spent 33 on our meal excluding tips
mightve helped spice up the bland quac and salsa combo instead to use it as a chip dip
even at the bar it just doesnt feel right
i didnt really care but what are you going to do
get wasted and youll love it
the best izakaya experience youll get
well mr donald sterling tells me well its early in the morning and i dont want people to get uncomfortable  its almost like playing hardcore rap music with a bunch of f bombs no one wants to hear that
destiny was tending bar and was very attentive and my husband and i enjoyed her hospitality
the pesto left a lot to be desired as well
and if you like green tea i would recommend the jasmine blossom tea
ipa was bad  they said it was their second night with a bad tap
definitely need to try this place if you havent
we showed up a little after 6 and was strongly advised by our waiter to get drinks and apps because they were bogo during happy hour
i wish i would have told the manager to have the price of the entrees removed from our bill even though it would have taken him longer to do it
but in that regard they lackedhorribly
the burger was so over cooked it was black they basically just slapped some kraft cheese on top of pasta and microwaved some bacon and put that monstrosity together and my waffle fries
35 stars didnt end up getting the chance to try during their soft opening so did it after their official opening this location is definitely bigger than the one downtown in terms of seatingi liked their patio slightly more than the dt one if youre a regular use to izakayas you wouldnt mind the noise leveli personally love the way vibe and atmosphere becuz its more uniqued it was quite full on a friday night as expected and we arrived closer to 10ish so alot of the items we wanted were already sold outbooo we just ordered practically almost every item on the menu except for the ones being sold outthe thing with eating at izakayas is that all of the dishes come out so small and if you are looking to fill yourself upbe prepared to break your banki dont think this is a place where you want to eat until youre stuffednot a guud idea i will definitely be back without a doubt
when i went to pint central i went for the food not the drinks that might be why i was less than impressed
if you are looking for ok bar food this place will suffice
i do wish theyd slather some garlic and olive oil on it though
there seemed to be lots of apologizing to other tables about not getting bread sent out
their cinnamon roll was super fresh and absolutely tasty
i bring friends and family often vegetarians and omnivores alike and ive yet to have someone not enjoy their meal
if i ever come here for happy hour again im gonna order 3 of these and be done with it
prepare to have a fat bill even for a couple
and when her dish came out she had asked for mild but her dish was so hot it burned all of our throats
food was great and the portions were perfect
i had an amazing time for my first personal karaoke experience and there such a great selection of songs
i walked out
i ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries
my friend recommended that i came here for lunch today and i was very pleased at the quality of the meal
its in the perfect location beautiful interior but management just cant get it right
my wife loved the gluten free penne arrabbiata
id love to eat the foie gras from the poutine on its own let alone the phenomenal cheese curds
i love the burger place and the salad place all the way to the back radish
i have tasted much better elsewhere
we did not care for the sauce served with it which was a sweetsour sauce
if youre feeling rum come to this place you wont be disappointed
everything is fresh and delicious
our server was friendly without being obsequious and our meals arrived in a timely manner
this place cooks up real food not the fake stuff you get at mcdonalds or those other fast food places well be back for sure
for the record she did not answer so they can get laid possibly in an attempt to protect my youthful innocence but shrugged and offered i dunno hey you have to try a cosmopolitan
go the the valleys other million wine bars and youll see what im talking about
however instead of fixing the problem they repeated the same thing
the wait staff was attentive and quick to fill waters change plates and check on us
we have sushi once a week and i have found no better in arizona than got sushi
vegetables were fresh and cooked well
a little wait but thats expected being at the strip
yes i can
had the summer salad as a starter we both liked it
i tried their emerald green tea and it was pretty good
caprese salad was more of a balsamic vin tossed salad w tomatoes and mozz instead of your classic caprese
wife tried it and said the same thing
im always surprised that it isnt that busy but the prices arent exactly cheap either
the reservation didnt seem necessary even though it was sunday lunch time
the lemon added a nice zest and paired with the flavor of the calamari itself was perfect
we often bring our visitors to uni
definitely not worth the full price
the service was excellent our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions
better to kill time here than losing more money at the tables
she told us she gave our table away and if we wanted to dine with them it would be a 30 minute wait and their entire dining experience lasts 152 hours
all raw all the time
their weekend brunch menu with unlimited mimosas and bloody mary bar is a perfect way to celebrate the weekend
for my main i had the wedge steak salad 1399
waitress says teriyaki comes with soup or salad and a choice of tempura shrimp or veg
highlights include the grilled fish or roasted mushroom tacos  yum
the cole slaw had no flavor
the ginger was also quite potentmore than the wasabi as far as heat
did i mention i never go to clubs and havent drank that much since the incident in high school that involved a jug of cheap vodka and gallon of orange juice
the only down side is that i think the location is to small for the type of success they are having my favorite part about going there is taste the wine and beer they have on tap and the season bruschetta
came here for the verbena
the service is usually pretty good from the wait staff anyway
will definitely be back
cke has good angus beef
they truly allow you an all you can eat experience
and if you dare order the donut just plan to split it with a few neighbors or take some home with you
just finished lunch here and definitely will not come back
let me start out with the appetizers
the food selection is great
general too bad this place isnt on the strip but its worth the cab ride over here
but i definitely didnt care at all
i would have sent it back but was in a bit of a rush
we were all set on bloody marys and not having a reservation to get in anywhere else for brunch we figured sharp edge might not have eggs but theyd at least serve us a great bloody mary
six months ago i began my love affair with rum
service was fine wine was decent food was good but not memorable
well worth the wait and 20
next time ill have to order off the drink menu
the best sushi in the area
theres also a decent dessert selection the kitchen sink is always a favourite when i bring anyone visiting
greens and protein is my go to spot if im looking for a quick healthy meal
had a great time on a recent saturday night at hyde inside bellagio
i wondered in here on a thursday to find a huge beer menu full liquor bar and 2 taco special
awful customer service
it really left a bad taste in our mouths
had lunch here again today
moving on to the food
since we had just eaten we didnt order anything off the menu so my review doesnt include that
in 3 visits to ddd the burger patty has ranged from cardboardy to slightly less cardboardy
the fajitas smelled and looked great and service was on point
some times cold so bring a jacket
friendly bar staff but that was the only perk of the place
unfortunately there was no scene and the food while tasty was not worth a return visit
ive tried it twice so far but each time i am unmoved and longing to be eating something else
we sit at the bar always to be greeted by nicest lady on the planet
if you want some space or breathing room definitely venture upstairs to the balcony terrace area where you get an even closer view of the spaceship er i mean chandelier
my beef came out hot which was nice but it was rubbery
the night we visited the music was weird and super loud ranging from heavy metal to golden oldies
she knew the menu she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked
from my seat i couldnt reach any of the sauces silverware paper towels etc
spent two nights in toronto and went to the village idiot both nights
it was too rare
unfortunately i like the yogurt here better than their nearby competitors like tutti bella so im willing to put up with the small topping amount and forgettable service
my fave is the cenphopolitanor something very close to that
maybe ill just order at the bar ahead of time and request it be brought to the table like a fellow coworker did
now that just sounds like heaven
there was a drunk lady that was smoking next to us that i had to ask her to put our cigarette but she was fairly kind about it
i only wish they would put the creamy cheese on both ends of the plate
there were at least 8 dancers yet only one had a theme police officer  the rest looked like they came in straight from the gym with sweats and shorts or right off the street in their everyday gear
the scallop crudo and soy cured watermelon are fantastic
i never decline an invite to stop by for a beer and dinner here
the whole drink is pretty much all milk and no tea taste
just push open the door people the lunch crowd is quite eclectic but the dinner crowd is very different
when i sent it back telling the server that it was bland without a hint of spice i was informed in a condescending tone pad thai isnt supposed to be spicy
price we ordered the laguna which is about 13
the only thing that i didnt care for was the bread you pay 3 for artisanal bread and it is 4 slices of room temperature bread i wasnt too thrilled about it but i completely forgot about it when i ate my lobster thermidor which is served with several types of mushrooms delicious and pasta the pasta wasnt great either too much oregano i recommend that you substitute this one
we all had some weird stomachache afterwards
we went here for the first time for lunch today
staying in awathukee for 7 week escape from cold alberta canada
the shrimp is butterflied and fried in a delicate tempura batter
i was conflicted
not great food
tons of choices for every diet
im convinced he was not referencing the food
this review is for wet republic hakasan management only
the room was subtley lighted helping us relax into a new atmosphere after fighting the cold outside
the shrimp tempura roll was just ok to me
its kinda cool
the only thing was that the waitress was a total btch
we had a bowl of new england clam chowder wedge salad tomato salad and the beet salad
cant go wrong with brothers
kind of hipstery i suppose but we all secretly love that vibe
i am not going to sit here and say that firefly has better food than every other restaurant
our server patrick was so awesome too i dont think i realy need to say more just that you are missing out if you dont try this place for a chefs table night
overall this is a really fun place
people go there to see and be seen so they hype it up and build expectations way too high
the place is clean food is always coming out and being replaced staff is friendly and awesome
yardhouse is a nice laid back restaurant with hundreds of beers to try many on tap and some great food
weve used them several times
very easy to get to  not annoyingly downtown either
when i asked about it i was told that the half priced deal is only on the 6 wings and i didnt order 12 wings i ordered to orders of 6  i thought that 6 wings were only 6 not 650 as well but maybe i was mistaken
yes it is expensive during peak hours but we went midday on monday and it was perfect
although it was late my wifes order was correct she had the fried meatloaf but her words were it wasnt that great of  plate
sit on the patio to catch some rays while you eatdrink or in the brewery to admire the beer being made while you guzzle some down yourself
great atmosphere lots of places to sit great place to watch sports lovely outside seating will soon be done and drinks came out quickly
i was eating it by itself with a large spoon
the portions are tiny
i wouldnt dine indoors  its kind of dark and dull
the drinks are good 1 star and the view is excellent
all the bartenders and servers are friendly and give a positive vibe
we would not choose this nightclub to party at if it was the usual opentothepublic crowded night
we ordered up some pints and at the servers reco grabbed a pound of pineapple and curry wings
tips    get there early so you can really take the place in and have the time to enjoy your drinkfood
other than that the service is generally fine but can be spotty the crowd is a little too douchey for me some days but its all aok in my book
firstly when we had done bottle service many times before the bouncers would bend over backwards to make sure each and every person that had paid for admission would find their way to the table and have a great time
like it was sitting out for over 40 min our wait time after ordering
our order taken promptly refills on drinks and food prepared in a reasonable amount of time
so delicious decided to come back for lunch today
i wasnt expecting much this time around since i consider the other place my favorite in town and was still disappointed about it closing but i was so shocked
there was also never any apologies for the slow servicelack of beers
what you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served
definitely not worth it
they were too greasy to really know if they were fresh cut but they were wedges not fries
best soy lattes ever too
their sushi selection is ok but not as good as the other similar restaurants in the area like oyshi xtreme and kobe
after moving to toronto 6 months ago my girlfriend and i have frequented nuit social at least a dozen times
this gorram breakfast took 25 hours due to 1 the awful waitresses who kept disappearing for halfhours at a time and 2 the sssuuupppeeerrr ssssllloooowww kitchen
we always stop by here when we walk along queen street
also this place is dirty
delicious smoked beef brisket that is
all around i was impressed
clientele is after work crowd mainly 30s and 40s
food was simply amazing
when i visited pittsburgh first thing i did was visit the strip district
there is usually a cover and parking is limited and onstreet
i definitely recommend these guys because of how fast they text  email you back as well which is great if you have questions
since i love old fashions i thought id try this place as it was also highly reviews and recommended
thank you daily kitchen
may sound corny but its true
5 stars for the no
i was sceptical going in because i get the feeling while wondering these hotels and casinos that you are in a mall
food is wonderful
its just good for drinks
quick and polite service and lovely coffees at reasonable prices
we absolutely loved it
buy 10 get one free stamp card
i went with spicy creamy as my sauce
if i didnt have a big vip area and had to stay down on the dancefloor i would have had a terrible night
now i dont care how backedup your kitchen is thats still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service
edited to add they do not have good ranch
the only negative is the smoking
my daughter had the pad thai noodles she could not eat her dish
i came in for lunch and although was in the afternoon there was no one at the door
price is a bit high but its worth
i love san tan
boy and i went to tamari on a friday evening
they also have a great selection of sushi sushi lunch specials special rolls and all of the typical japanese dinner dishes
every tuesday i am in vegas i make the long trek down to mandalay place and eat at my favorite burger joint
the bf and i were very hungry
when we actually got to the restaurant i got it
it will feel pretty pricey for what taste like the same delicious mexican food we can get at out favorite late night mexican spots but the great service atmosphere and food presentation makes it all worth it
if your young and live in the ballantynepineville area this is a great spot
i mean its pretty simple do not go to soul on thursday or friday night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs
we were not informed of any wait when we ordered
i tried a few of the specialty cocktails and although they were good
i wasnt a fan of the mac and the waitress was kind enough to take it off my bill and even offered a replacement side
i like their idea of selling shakes with alcohol
commonplace coffee has set up a small stand near the bar area when you enter
this is a new company here and granted the execution isnt so great but what do you expect for a seven dollar price
now when i get a light margarita at any other bar it comes in a 16 oz glass
everything tasted off
a hidden gem
the charcuterie board was nice but we couldve done without it
im not one to look at the price but this place made me do it
the roll size is big similar to sushi bong but the rice lacks the sweetness and rice vinegar flavour
so i thought i would try a few random things
look for the seperate sushi menu in the photo section
fries were great
i have an indicard so i use it whenever i go for the sweet discount dont worry the amount we save is usually what goes to the server for their tip  for example our bill tonight for 2 sodas burger nachos tostada nachos and a fried ice cream was only 21 with the indicard hookup so we tipped 20
ultimately this is a good bar and i was pleasantly surprised and will visit again
pretty ok  nothing earth shattering
the mushroom miso was a little weird because it was really not misoey if that makes any sense
appetizer chicken quesadillas was tasty but we were not given plates when it came to the table
three younger shaved headed guys seriously vocal decide they need to start chanting fk the irish in the pub
the parking can suck
definitely recommend this place
2 draft beers
there was a 25 cover charge per person but it wasnt a big deal
instead of a polite thank you for letting him know  this jerk quotes me nc law after someone has 1 drink here  heshe cannot sue even if they break their neck on the stairs
im so glad some of our regular spots let us down so we found ricks pub  grub
has really degraded in to a very rough spot with poor food and service
i had the chile relleno but had them add the carne adobada instead of the regular shredded beef
aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them
not bad for a sports bar as i do not like sports bar food
pro tip have them remove the citrus pieces from the drink
staff are knowledgeable food is exquisite and wine selection is incredible
finally the 5th man that looks at the card says loudly who is amber
i was very impressed by the space
definitely check out this place for amazing donuts
lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful
not my cup of tea but she loved it
the fried chicken was the highlight with its light and crisp coating and fried chilies
their bread of choice is naan bread and there was actually an indian guy behind the glass baking the bread
also note they change their menu for late night which i think is after 9p making the selection a lot smaller so dont go expecting anything more than chicken tenders or a burger made by the bartender
nice and creamy not overly sweet but just sweet enough
the service can be spotty previously mariamaria theyre still a fairly new establishment but the great atmosphere and food makes up for it
happy hour here is one to try out 26pm
im not looking for the absolute in authenticity
pool tables are well kept the bar is clean and even the bathrooms are nice here
i highly recommend this place if you are looking for a delicious meal friendly service and an all around great time
i really dont like to leave negative reviews
so that automatically adds to its greatness
i had had french fries for lunch so i got cole slaw instead
again gave this restaurant another try because it means so much to us
i have to get my game face on because marios its on
if youve never been to the real one this is 4 or 5 stars
i must say the noodles which arent very noodley but rather flat and wide and irregular shaped were fantastic
this isnt a fancy place but with as much detail thats paid to their defining features theyre successful in everything they set out to do
it is freaking worth the price
i could not have been more mistaken
while pickled vegetables seem a goto when working with sausage ie
probably wont order it again but i will deffinetly be back here my next vegas trip
everyone who works here from the owners who come to your table to chat with you to the employees who remember your order and your name make this a stellar addition to the community
i had the stuffed peppers sauce was delicious
crispy rice salad was sooooooo good
granted it was a monday night football but staff accordingly
the drinks ran dry for several minutes before sonia asked if we would like another round
we were not even full
what a great addition to the charlotte food scene
lots of glossy rustic wood
well that drink is the size of my head
she knew we had a toddler with us too
yet the manager never showed up
everyone else got scallops salmon steak shrimp lobster and all loved their food
and lastly the forks can use an upgrading
not an overly exotic menu but very good thai food
i was initially disappointed that they had run out of fish and chips by noon but this was an excellent dish and i forgot about my first choice by the time it arrived
the food was just alright
overall the staff was friendly and the food was good
i had to make a yelp account just to write a review for this place  the girls here are always so friendly and quick everytime that i come by whether its through the drive through or inside
anyway when this place is on its pretty damn solid
this pizza reminds me of something i once had in naples
yeah the water in our base was a very dark brown color when we got it
basically meatballs hints the balls and spaghetti or something
please please do not leave here without ordering the insalata della casa
some of the performers are better than others i found and someone should perhaps advise the entertainment committee that whats crude isnt necessarily whats clever
service not memorable but not bad sat at bar
30 which is a burger with sauted onions and a fried egg on it
the food flies out of the kitchen fast
and dont mind if you take your time ordering like i do because with so many options i become confuzzled
because its to much for the servers to handle
the bbq here is delicious
they used giant bamboo for railing and used nice paint etc
its a little nerve wrecking at first
i still havent tried either shrimp appetizers or the eggplant appetizer
mind you we were sitting at the bar next to a few guys
i had a half regular half sweet potato order of fries and both were darn delicious
solo or with friends i have a good time and enjoy going there
do not skip dessert here they have a souflee that is crazy good
we passed by this a number of times trying to find it
we had a wonderful meal and i highly recomment it
if i crave steak again before i leave this area ill definitely get it from here
i appreciated the choice of brown rice which most traditional chinese restaurants dont provide
i would totally come here again if i need a night just to chill chat with friends and dance to some great music
this takes the cake by far
this sushi place is new clean and the food tastes very fresh
this is a great spot to have a quick drink meet others and people watch
drinks menu was less impressive though
we had a delicious grilled camembert appetizer which was perfect to share with a beer
this place was fantastic from the beers at the bar all the way to dessert at the end of our meal
be prepared you have to get the fries and coleslaw on your sandwich even if you dont like it
at this point im full fat dumb and happy so i declined his offer to replace it with something else
classy atmosphere delicious fresh tasting food and excellent service
take advantage of the balmy summer weather at sky yard and bask in the sun while enjoying  a great evening of delicious food and drink
my husband likes the curious george martini which has some type of banana liquor
proven at 2am that night when i vomited every chunk of ground beef
the owner mike always comes around and thanks us for our business
even when it was too hot out i didnt not want to leave
we ordered the fajitas and got the wednesday special 4 margaritas
had a few drinks then went outside for a smoke
it is a real find the staff was not overly familiar or cloying but they all seemed genuinely interested in making sure both the service and the meal was  to our satisfaction
food is good
it is very loud
beer was good but still expensive
we watched as the empty restaurant filled as we remained in the cramped waiting area
happy hour prices for the value are unbelievable
you probably wouldnt want it to be any better since youre at a pool its not like youre expecting seafood or pasta here
update to my original review   the owner john was gracious enough to give me a gift card to apologize for my negative experience
the carpets are stained
it was an interesting dish  for the lack of a better word because i had more fun poking at the egg and trying to eat it with my salad than how much i actually enjoyed the taste of the salad itself
didnt bring me cutlery for 10min after my food arrived
the price is a bit high but for healthy food that nourishes your bodymuscles you cant put a price tag on that
i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good sushi
only downside was that the place was dead and the chairs were super uncomfortable
its a 55 by itself
it did feature a few texmex items that i normally do not see up north
awesome service and classy treatment from the owner that makes you feel appreciated to be there
we shared the grilled beef tenderloin with mushrooms
the food is not bad but the portion sizes are definitely smaller than i would typically expect for a brunch entree
loved the food atmosphere and service here
cant beat the all you can eat sushi during lunch for 10
tip check first if they have the daily newspapers
overall not impressed
for a second i thought he didnt understand us because who in their right mind would continue onto their other tasks when a customer is waiting to start their meal when it has been served
liked soup more than anything yes that good
the decor and vibe is super laid back and casual
however theyre still serving plenty of alcohol which is illegal
we were seated outside and there was a private party going on
i cant blame the server for the food but i can blame the server for the great service
it is an all you can eat but it is not a buffet
anyhow 4 stars for ambience and relatively delicious food
we all had sides which were all perfect in their own way
food ahi tuna tasteless thai snapper ceviche bland angus mini burgers  not enough sauce too much meat beef carpaccio phenomenal repeat nope
i travel a lot and while i can afford it its the spirit of the charge that befuddles me
its a nice neighborhood bar
not somewhere i would hang on the regular
it was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife
went there to have a couple of drinks ended up eating here
just seriously hot
wir sind immer auf der suche nach gutbrgerlicher schwbischer kche
near 7 pm the tables surrounding us were filling up
the first time i had theirs japoburger was really good
they brought me one of those when i questioned the first drink so no problem
we had a nice window seat and could people watch and grab some snacks from food junkie directly outside
living in the peoria area i have been here numerous times
a little too rich maybe
one time i was taller than my husband at the table
the cocktails and wine list were the norm for hipster tremont
my son said it was like a cheeseburger only harder to eat
cute candy store but very expensive
the owner came over to check on us a couple times which i appreciated
love this place
if you are craving sushi or any kind of japanese dish wait until the next day and eat elsewhere
there is a huge list of alcohol
there were so many choices we cant wait to go back and try more
the pasta is wonderful and you must try the red velvet cake and cannolis omg the cake i got 3 pieces out of one serving
love the clean atmosphere and foods
honestly the first time i tried this place i didnt think it was too bad
my only complaint about this dish and patria is that there were some rubbery chewy pieces of lamb that i had to spit into a napkin
the staff is friendly
grapefruit is once a month on fridays and hands down the best most mixed night both musically and crowd wise
i love to play pool here and the wings are amazing
there was another one that was kind of sweet caramel kind of thing that had sesame seeds so so good
i love how cute the place is
i hope nori sushi keeps up the good work
my dad ordered the birria which he also thought was too salty and greasy
attention to quality and service are above and beyond
overall a very affordable tasty and pleasant alternative to the typical lunch fare im used to and a great atmosphere to boot
again no flavor in the fish and kind of dry the corn tortillas were cold and tastes like out of a package
get on cineworld online get yourself tickets to a nice wee movie and get yourself to mccowans an hour early for a premovie bite
i get it wine is not cheap unless its the boxed stuff so i suppose they cant really do much about that
doughnuts w hot fudge
im still in shock at the low prices
visiting las vegas from california and found this new place
such arrogant cocky frat boys for security
great happy hour good service pretty good food
bartenders are nice
it is a bit small but we can always find seating no problem  we have also ordered takeout a few times
the place is located in the new sports complex just south of the freeway and north of van buren on avondale ave  it was a bit difficult to find the first visit
keep up the good work pam and thanks for all your hard work to make my time enjoyable even though the machines were awful
sushi was great especially the cherry blossom roll
the people behind the counter are very nice and courteous
they didnt check up on us a ton but we were still okay with the rest of our service
one of those rolls were youre not sure whats going on but you like it you roll with it
this place is almost too good to be true
they have the best chicken and waffles that i have had in pittsburgh
unfortunately when we got ours we had half the amount
we went for lunch on 122315
so dont be afraid to try it
i was quite impressed
but i went with the chicken arepa with regular seasoned fries and my husband had the chorizo arepa with arepa fries
half way through our meal it got very loud because there was a work party in the other part of the restaurant that apparently started doing gifts or something 20 people all laughing
the bowl had a great balance of flavors and i could barely finish it all
the salsa and chips with beer are my safe choices but i rarely go now
now go and eat
this place is just for yorkdale hipster snobs to be seen in
i must say that they made such a great effort to make this experience a good one
well i told you 10 min and you were in there for an hour
i was excited that theres a new sushi joint in the neighborhood and took advantage of the deal chicken that was being offered
our meal started with the salumi board a selection of meats that varied from delicious to if you try to take this away ill stab you
their other highly recommended roll called this guy tasted like salted matza on rice
it is worth the walk however
the sushi is well presented and as fresh as you can get in montreal
if you like bread before your meals firebirds will not disappoint
debbie sensed a vanilla flavor and it was topped with chopped peanuts
i am a regular
aside from all that the staff was very nice and approachable the restaurant was set up beautifully and the dessert was uhmazeing
everything on the menu is 495 additional for add ons
the cocktails and liquor selection are pretty good  the duck fat popcorn is amazing
sit on the patio  good for ppl watching and you can still see the football games on
the price was right and youd think if its the 2 best seller you cant go wrong
4 levels  level 12 kid friendly 34 21  several bar locations
this is a place where you just go for conversation and a drink
i had the brussel sprouts with pork belly but i really really enjoyed this steak and will probably not come close to it again
sushi is good but the customer service sucks like wow it was bad
after that we decided to just sit at a table and try to order food
i have not found any good sushi places in the valley except mido sushi on kyrene and ray great deal if youre looking for all you can eat
i liked it before and after the name change
they take your choice of hummus and spread it all over the bottom of the bowl and load everything on top of it
someones tidy and taken care of backyard with fresh fake turf and little picnic tables
the food is good the portions large almost too large and the service is great friendly and prompt
wouldnt you know it that piece of meat had no pink what so ever she sent it back and we shared since we didnt want to wait for an entree to be cooked
surprised to find this spot as the rest of the hood is mostly mexican food
she made great entree and dessert suggestions
went here on vacation
the side of waffle fries and fresh fruit were decent but the portions were minuscule
why did i get hungover
asked them t correct
the tanner fries were ok i guess if you like room temperature soggy spuds with some sort of parsley flake garnish
gf and i went for the first time on friday night and it was wonderful
bartender rudely says its not happy hour yet
next time its the eggs florentine im after
the food was pretty tasty our group tried the filet mignon pork tenderloin shrimp with cavatappi and several salads
at first sight the plate looked like it was going to be the best dinner entree from their summerlicious menu based on the volume of meat given on the plate
obwohl relativ wenig los war ca
theyve been very patient and accommodating
although looking back maybe that was her way of saying you have had enough
waterproof ear plugs are provided
the food itself is very averagetypically the tk chains have cute girls behind the bar  this place is all dudes in skirts
both were good but the rolls tasted pretty similar to each other
had the chilechiles without chorizo refried beans with freshly crisped tortillas chicharrone with lime and seasoned salt and a selection of tacos pork tinga pork belly that was like pastor with pineapple and spicy chicken
well this is the same thing with soda
schn ist die auswahl an sossen die auf den tischen steht
bryan  nancy are the perfect hosts
its worth the try especially if you have a groupon
the hibiscus drink was so good not too sweet just enough vodka and good for a second round
je dois avouer que la premire fois que jai pens aller au sushi time je suis rentre puis sortie en moins de 2 minutes
we were famished and thirsty so this was good on an average level
its a bit difficult to describe so bear with me
when someone comes at you with a sincere honest request like that youd have to have a heart of stone to say no
4 stars only because this was the first time here
we stayed at the d when it was the fitzgerald we enjoyed our stay and are planning on booking a staycation there soon to see all the changed they made to the place
it was put of this world
before heading home the next day we had to stop for to go
i would never recommend
when i questioned her about us getting the wrong pizza she wasnt even sure what the pizza was supposed to have on it
petites portions avec prix levs qui passent moins quand cest pas bon
soft drinks and ice tea
the line was long as was the wait for lunch
also her food recommendation was great for our group
ive been here a few times and the food has been ok but nothing to write home about
on the saturday night we dropped by it was a fine blend of nostalgic rb and classic and newer hiphop
the prices very reasonable
overall this is best japanese hibachi restaurant in las vegas
were originally from maryland so were very picky about our crabcakesand we were shocked to discover they actually did them correctly
i probably not gonna go back again
and the dinner options are not too expensive either
we sat down and a waiter took our drinks order and then maybe 2 minutes later a waitress came over and asked what we wanted
i also had the hashbrowns which were super good as well
my jaw was so tired from chewing the rice that i couldnt really appreciate the flavours  perhaps why i thought it was bland
what i didnt expect was for the crowd to be thin until the afternoon pirates game let out
i like the chicken tacos better than the shrimp but they were both excellent
we headed to the balcony which really was the only reason that this review received any stars
ive been here 3 times now and am planning a 4th trip
ive been going to this restaurant since it was cb legacy
they were served with a garlic lemon rosemary aioli for dipping
10 minutes to get basic drinks 30 more to get basic order of burgers and fries
served some good cocktails
we had the ayce sushi but we didnt try much until we were disgusted beyond belief
is it because they think they are getting a healthy alternative to x food want to feel good about themselves and dont mind spending a small fortune on a nonalcoholic drink
she brought the to the wrong table first
al dente pasta just the way it should be
unfortunately this is where we stayed
despite being all over the map sushi chinese malaysian thai japanese cuisine malaya does really well as in authentic with some stuff pretty well with the rest
amazing food fantastic rewards card for free 10 when you sign up and 20 credit during your birthday month
it was 1130am  so the place was not busy
but anyways they also have ramen here but i wouldnt really recommend it
i was here with a high profile client that wanted to watch the hockey game so we came here since it is close to the convention center
we sat at the bar and ordered a tangerine speedo and a green gasser
when we eat here my mother raves about their chile relleno
he might not be crazy about a dish personally but shared with other customers thought
all 4 times were awesome  i got same thing blended taro with boba  glaze donut
japanese beer selection
they always have our lunches out quickly as they are conscious of our time crunch
ive only tried the appetizers so far calamari garlic shrimp jerk chicken fries and i highly recommend them
so it was fun but i dont think we will be back
great food fast service and centrally located in vegas
but i do get sick of being stared at as if i dont belong
based on this meal and some of the others i saw coming out from the kitchen i think the food looks great but doesnt quite deliver
my biggest peeve was the the side rice and beans were not good at all
its been open a week and ive ordered out once and dined in once
while i still think the service is really really bad if youre not sitting at the bar
weve been waiting for awhile for berry divine to open up as we live a block away
no apology no please sit down and well bring it to you nothing
but stay awayyy from the cherry bombs maraschino cherries soaked in everclear
once seated we were told the kitchen was three hours behind and the wait for food would be three hours
a pancetta base with onion garlic black pepper red pepper flakes basil and oregano would improve the flavor
you have to walk past the entrance to associated bank which is super odd but once you get past that youre golden
i caught a few flying elbows from these little asian girls dancing next to me
i have been to this location 3 times now and have been happy every time
i got the filet mignon which i thought was delicious
given the quality quantity and pricing of the food i wouldnt recommend this spot
it was very delicious
i really liked the fish but the chips were a bit soggy
the mac and cheese was delicious but also semiwarm
there were some longans coconut basil seeds and green squiggly thingies
short time passed but seemed long due to our frustration
there arent too many maybe no places like this in las vegas
hot options and dessert are strictly middling
i see servers standing and chatting while using menus to fan themselves looking unhappy
definitely get the chicken and bacon waffles its amazing
from what i gather you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and theyll call your name when your drink is ready
youll still have to snake yourself around a tight lineup in busy periods or put up with when they have mistaken your poke bowl for a sushi burrito order or vice versa one of the drawbacks of this haveitonewayoranother scheme
we met some friendly guys who pointed us in the right direction for post drinking activities in montreal
staff has definitely gotten better from when they first open mixing service and entertainment together
i was impressed
they were not busy but i watched them completely lose a guys order for a burger
though there are safe midwestern dishes steak on the menu my wife and i prefer to eat out of the box a little
they made that dirty dank dark divvy hole in the wall into a chic trendy restaurant
im so glad we did it was so good
we take our family which includes our 2 year old there all of the time
i love this place
the service was great and the drinks were delicious
i will see you in 2 days and i cant wait
overall three stars would rate higher if the food was better and the service a little faster
the service can be okay or awful
theyre trying hard to represent an irish pub but with the cranberries crooning zohohmbee eeh eeh eeh  on the speakers and the notre dame fighting irish playing on tv its classic vegas kitsch
and the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you
not what youd see at all you can eat
it is supposed to be juicy and melt in your mouth
its awesome and offers a wonderful experience
he was out in less than a minute very courteous and asks what is wrong
walked into small bar at around 120 looking to use the facilities and grab a drink
you must try this
i recently came to luma for dinner for a night out with my wife
great  food  and really high prices  so it is good but i dont think it is worth it  i felt like all you are paying for is their obviously high rent due to the trendy location ill go back but not often
he showed up immediately started talking down to us and eventually loudly announced among other things and with a bit of attitude no i dont think thats gonna happen in front of my whole family
maybe the best beer in the burgh though the sharp edges selection really cant be touched
do not be fooled by other imitation chain ah sos
depends on their mood
i selected the vegetable fajitas with corn tortillas gluten free option and without any dairy easily adapted for this vegan
theres a menu of about 20 drinks and theyre all strong
ciba mato is also a hookah bar and there is nothing more relaxing than leaning back against the plush pillows staring up at the night sky drink in hand the sweet smell of your neighbors hookah drifting over
i went here with a group of nine
the cod fritters were dry and did not have much flavour at all another subpar dish
i love the way the hostess made sure to tell us our servers name and introduced himself with a name card
they are cooked just right not burnt and not alarmingly hot against just right
very very expensive
this was by far the best sushi place in the valley
it was my first fried spinach and it was surprisingly good
the sprouts were seasoned well with caramelized shallots and sherry vinaigrette  roasted to perfection
i get its a staffing issue but i hate when it happensits annoying to see as a guest
it is the perfect quiet spot for a date or to catch up with the girls
we had that  the save the tuna rolls house salad with watermelon  walnuts my little dumplings blueberry cheesecake with walnut crust
last time i was here was in 1998  i wont forget because i was in town on business and had dinner with my dad in order to tell him i was pregnant with his grandbaby
denise came to check on us and joked the entire party was silent so the food had to be good
the drinks are priced as you wpould expect of a pub in the area with pints costing around 3 and spirits slightly more
ive had beers from this brewery before  once they had their girls pushing caps and shades and free samples over at fibber mcgees and i found that i really liked their mandarin wheat
we got a room at the el rancho motel then stumbled down the road to drink the nite away at the succession of quaint little bars lining main street
the tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking and i had a tough time getting it down and eventually i got so turned off i did not finish it
i read good reviews before going so i hope this was a fluke experience
the shared app of chicken nachos came
they have one of the better happy hours in town square
first bar experience it was pretty good
if they dont know you by nameyou get the impression that they intend to
we never had to ask or wait for a single thing
service was great the place is cozy has a western feel to it and everyone was friendly
price for three with a bottle of 75 and three beers was 350
during the fight the sound was lacking and would completely go away
overpriced unexciting and unauthentic
if i had one negative thing to say it would be that i did not like the paintings on the wall but i just cant say that
if you love a busy restaurant that has buzz this is the place to be
especially local businesses where i can get drizzunk
great authentic food really completes the experienceall at a reasonable price
the service was terrible so it diminished my experience and i probably will never return
our other complaint was that they wanted 19 for a neat woodford reserve thats insane
king roll that was supposed to have seaweed salad inside really was lettuce
the small plates are 615 each but we ended up needing 3ish per person
not really much i can think of to improve on it
we exited our table with exactly 1 minute to spare
the service was slow and disjointed
4 thin slices perfectly cooked so the cod was still tender and moist
overall good experience
the outside seating area is the perfect getaway from the constant busy casinos
great for working or a few card games with friends here
was vacant for an extended period of time
i was totally baffled
it was really loud inside especially when people started playing that bowling arcade game right next to us
i understand this is a really busy location but they have been consistently mediocre
cant wait to go back
the waitresses change outfits to give the illusion that a lot of women are here no joke
one way to tell a good barbeque joint
the possibility for music and theatrics entertainment during dinner and afterwards just keeps you brainstorming all night
check out the burrito challenge with the yard of margarita  tough to finish but delicious and worth a free t shirt
wife loved the artic char fish
i hope he fixes things there because the employees dont appear to care about the customers
i will go back again
like when i walk in to quiktrip most mornings my standard place for breakfast the nice folks there always say hello and make you feel welcome and they make eye contact with you when you are being rung up at the register
however the star of the dish is the ketchup
everything tasted very fresh and nothing was overpowering with the arugula well but not overdressed with balsamic
by the way friends of ours stopped on the all you can eat crab legs night
this is our 3rd visit
that is if youre willing to shell out 510 to park
the seating amopshere waa great for chatting
it was basically half a chicken accompanied with buttermilk biscuits
thats the only advice id have for cph
we ordered an appetizer of mung thai nachos and different burgers for each of us
the only negative was that the avocado tasted like it came out of a pack like it does at sams club
they only let in a limited number of people at a time so if you have to leave for any reason you are looking at an hour wait to get back inside if not longer
if you are local id recommend liking them on facebook as they often post specials game day etc
two of them were supposed to be waters and never showed up
we stalked a staff member down and told them our name for the reservation and they told us it would just be a minute for our table
service was good
we ordered two lunch specials one being a hibachi steak and the other being a shrimp terriyaki bento box
and you call that a roll
the club is divided into two sections with outdoor section having a lounge kind of ambience and inside being a actual dance club
it was monday i was excited for the all you can eat so i paid it
it was fine
the food was good that is not the problem hereits the service and the manager
my experience was a good one my family enjoyed it very muchthe kids had a good timethe sever was very friendly
the dance floor was so packed there is no way that you can really dance
good flavor nothing spectacular
wide variety of ingredients
since we were a group of 10 we had a wide range to choose from and it was a much better time and food came out promptly
i dont know but i enjoyed it
prices were steep but i think you get what you pay for with the quality and freshness
however they do have decent ribs
i wish there was more seating room sometimes as it fills up on most nights but thats just a testament to how good it is
filet was cooked to perfection
they are also open late which is wonderful because i stay up late
all the toppings are very delicious but the type of flat bread they use here is a bit powdery and it dried out my lips
i would give it 5 stars but they do not have a poker room which is my game of choice
we too had a restaurantcom coupon and yes still wound up paying 22 bucks for 2 rolls 2 sashimi and an octopus salad
as soon as we sat down at our table our server ashley  greeted us and told us she would be right with us
no pictures allowed
i cant wait to comeback
definitely eat here again
the waiters and waitresses are usually prompt and friendly though in all honesty i suspect the time of evening that i go may have to do with that
this place wavers between 35 and 4 stars depending on whos doing the cooking
beer  as far as the eye can see
i ordered chicken parm with the pasta of the day which happened to be spaghetti  with a ceasar salad
and for an extra 3 on top of your 810 beer you can upgrade from a pint to a 24 oz mug
fresh is a priority with them
the salt and pepper shakers were both empty
food a little on the pricey side considering its in mississauga
we usually order the combo  pan roast
love this place
as a local we come here all the time
the fish tanks lighted tree red display cases with carved tusks and ceiling in the bar show some potential in decorating
it was delicious
if you want to be safe order the pizza
how could it be that 30 minutes go by and nothing opens up after being told we were next
on the way to the mall i stumbled upon this burger gem
awful does not even begin to describe this girls attitude
the service was really fast and the waiter very attentive
today was 30 degrees outside and there were no air conditioning
honestly you dont go wrong they play good music and the staff is always nice
porterhouse steak 32 with sides of baked potato baked sweet potato and asparagus with a side of hollandaise all 6 each
the tofu is made with minced pork in a sort of gravy consistency
one side of the menu is health food and the other side is junk food
being next to scotiabank theatre  this is sure to be my go to spot for healthy and delicious food before or after my movie now
the elderflower remedy and black cherry bourbon are excellent
because of my experience last time the management came to our table and was very apologetic
she looked overwhelmed and i felt her pain as a former food server
if i am ever struggling to pick my meal its nice to have the option to build your own
the team there is awesome
today i had a bloody mary 5 on happy hour
i almost wanted to hug the chef
surprisingly the salsa is pretty good
we were very surprised that it was actually very good
great food and friendly staff
wonderful atmosphere and the folks behind the bar were friendly and knowledgeable about their beers
this place is a wonder hidden gem in what is often looked at as a rough area
the price is in the high end but it is well worth it
as others have said the dinner portions are huge
then today i call for a take out order for hubby and guess what
we were seated immediately at a table outside with a perfect view for the silly pirate show
toyama  they dont have udon but their mixed tempura appetizer with 2 pieces of shrimp and 4 vegetables is 795
they have recently changed their hours so they are open 24 hours
getting a table for 8 isnt usually a challenge on a monday night and this was no exception
we asked for an unfiltered cold sake and she brought us a filtered sake mixed with club soda and lime
so naturally  after reading about this place from a yelper whose reviews i trust find very humorous not to mention a girl i absolutely adore from 3000 miles away i had to come here when i was in vegas
appetizers oxtail fries  3 stars
i went to tropical smoothie on my way to work and no one was up front so i stood all by myself waiting to be helped for a good 10 mins
we will definitely go back
also the bathroom was pretty gross
its where i spent most of my time while the guys golfed
piedmont social house has been good to me so heres the thing ive always gone with large groups who have always arrived separately and in small groups at various times and weve always been accommodated which at times can be difficult to find
granted even with the happy hour steaks a 2 hour visit normally rings in about 130 with all the drinks you wont be able to resist i pay it with a smile and shake the bartenders hand with a gracious tip of the hat
i have also noticed that their chicken is very tender and juicy versus other fast food japanese restaurants i have ate at who tend to over cook and dry the chicken out
the fries were good and portioned perfect thanks for not dumping a plateful as i probably would eat em all
my boyfriend and i like the foie gras the magret de canard when they offer it and the steak frites
even the paid dancers looked like they were hating it
i was really wanting this place to be good
overall the quality of the bbq was alright
i really appreciated how knowledgable she is about the products she is serving both food and drink alike
when asked about whether the asian pork happy hour taco specials were greasy were told no but they are deep fried
this had to be the most disappointing meal i have ever had mainly because we had wanted to dine here for so long
finally feeling better after 24 hours of hell
the jackets the hoodies the glass of the month the other perks its an addiction
however the taste is great and the service was great as well
something that is sorely lacking around these parts
maybe its time to offer a pricing for locals and maybe beef up the happy hour offerings
i hope they add live music on the patio
very chewy and had a nice caramelmaple syrup flavour on its own probably the best tapioca pearls ive ever had in bubble tea
its a fantastic and tasty treat
i go here all the time and its basically my neighborhood bar
love this place
its always a very nice experience
i have been to the restaurant that was in this space previously and this one is much better
overall not a good experience
dig the atmosphere  and great prices on drinks
the interior design of hachi is beautiful
secondly the bread guy was not doing his job
the desserts were ok but the pineapple mojito was pretty bad
no need for apologize or ask me to come be and revisit and give you a second chance
definitely go there for all you can
the fried brussel sprouts were great to be fair though i love brussel sprouts my dinner dates all had to try them too
the menu offers many different rolls however the recommended rolls were the most delicious
as a local ive acquired a discerning taste for vip service
tenderloin steak was way under seasoned
ill be back for sure to root for my niners and as they lose proceed to enjoy alcoholic beverages
definitely try the standard crispy fish and pork adobada tacos
service was a tad deficient
i said im just getting my fucking money and he flipped out and said i wasnt allowed to have a drink there
we had the mini set menu pretheater dinner and it was plenty of food and delicious
the halfsize was the perfect portion for one
if youre looking to grab a cool refreshing lunch this is the place
will definitely go back not because of the club but because of the location
not a fancy place but it is a convenient spot to get your boba to go
lots of variety in their specialty rolls
portions are the best ive ever seen in any thai restaurant ive been to around the world although i havent been to thailand to truly compare
unfortunately we realized that we donated to the cause as there were a lot of couples and not as lively as we had hoped
i may give their other beers a try if ive got time to kill but id have a hard time recommending any craft beer fans visit this place specifically for the beer
not overly sweet with lots of fruit pieces
i am informed that they now longer have the shot glass for the special but would i be interested in another of their fine margaritas
try the grilled pork belly
the drinks are okay
i do try and make sure i eat healthier than my disgusting smoking habit but we stopped into ds on our way back into town and i was still in vacation mode
over 90 of their product is maintained at a warm room temperature today it was 100 degrees and the front door was open and ive had several bad bottles from this place
i have been to rivertowne verona and in monroeville to eat and drink
i was invited here by my friend for a line dancing event
the entire ordeal was just so blah and unremarkable to me that i ultimately decided to forego buying a pint glass
the location is pretty hard to find also
i dont think i have ever had a fish taco that tasted that amazing
the classic was great on the ribs
assorted sushi could be changed for just one kind
full bar great menu and location
the patio is beautiful and very spacious
also happy hour is pretty awesome
did i mention there is a dj
the owner then comes around and notifies me that they have removed the oysters from my tab walks away and shares a good laugh with the waiter
formerly known as sonoran brewery i still miss the name sunup still has the same great food beer and service
it was so stinking hot in there
so much ado for so very little
then just add the meat or veggies of your choice and voila a kathi roll
though the prices are indeed a bit high i felt it was worth it for the wonderful food ambiance and service
this is the first place i tried shabu shabu and i enjoyed it but they stopped doing that about five years ago
the presentation was impressive and the food was good
he was pleseant and never rushed us at all
came here on sat and its fully booked
it comes with the potatoes and eggs fresh fruit and bread
rude all the way around such a shame that such a great atmosphere and such great food is paired with undesirable service
great service  good food  and clean environment
definitely on the lower end of sushi
there was another woman serving and things seemed to move a bit quicker once we were seated
thanks again for making it special
the bahn mi sausage is my favorite
they wrote happy birthday on my plate with chocolate sauce  my souffl was sinful
we were staying at the monte carlo and ill admit the only reason we decided to check it out before going out was because of the ladies drink free from 67pmalso 1011pm the free drinks are all well drinks and also one type of beer
this place has gotten so filthy
obsessed with the lobster bisque
deelicious and fresh
there are some solid midwestern beers but when it comes to the madison specific options there arent many
its a lot better than go for tea but some of the food is a bit overpriced
food and cocktails are not the only thing that is appealing for happy hour
so i will try my best to explain the highs and the lows
not for me at all
client dinner a few nights back and i waited to post as i had a tough time justifying the price paid to the food
the check was salty too   i like the room and space and atmosphere
the bartender let us know got us menus right away and checked back quickly to get our order so that we could take advantage of the happy hour
the restaurantcom deduction helped to cushion what would otherwise have been a pricey dinner 3195 for one order of filet mignon  lobster alone but it comes with an automatic 18 gratuity
great great hot wings  who knew
my wife and i were in town for my bday and we ended up here
i am always hesitant to try grilled cheese since i have a very particular way of how i like my grilled cheese not too cheesy not too salty bread not too thick etc
i plan on going here next time im in vegas
this place rocked
great sushi spot for downtown
their edamame was pretty damn incredible
i have been to redbeards on mt
coolest most eclectic washrooms too
if you reserve on open table i think there is only one table they seat you at and it is next to the server stand
i would give it 5stars but the service is typically only okay at best unless you sit at the bar  service is much better there
usually when asked that it is for the main course
we also had food sent 2 our table that wasnt our order and heard a worker say the server dont know their table numbers
finally our waiter showed up with the additional one we ordered after asking about it twice but the one from the tasting menu was still a no show
its become inconsistent
japan sushi gets my business when the queues at sushi on bloor are too long and i am in a hurry to eat its right across the street
tokyo sushi is separated into two sections one obviously getting better service
overall great experience
for 1400 i guess i expected more
you arent going to find douchey frat boy types here
today we got two bacon cheeseburgers with fries a philly cheese steak and fries and a baked italian sub with fries
theyre not comfy and you will feel a bit wonky on them
we really wanted to keep going but were so wonderfully full we needed to stop
overall this place is aok  nothing special
still a very fun place to go to off the strip in las vegas
the squid was also tasty but after ordering the popcorn chicken the dish felt a little repetitive as it shared the same fried texture and sweet chili sauce as the chicken
unfortunately they had changed the menu and made it more casual with same price tag
went with friends tonight that had gift certificate and all i can say is that i am happy i did not have to pay for this meal
ma and pop please stay at home and let the kids have a little fun
good food we will be back soon
that is not clean restaurants
we started off with a red sangria  we shared 5 dishes between the two of us
a few negative aspects  the music was way too loud and it was difficult to converse with the wife
the music generally varies from cheesy eighties sounds to the latest chart toppers so there is something for everyone
ramen was just like you find it in japan and the kids never said a word about their food other than their plates being empty
that was odd
what i love about the menu is that youre able to customize your meal
had a very attentive server
it was a bad experience
for a chain restaurant bahama breeze was not spectacular nor amazing
i still had a blast here though
i literally cannot stop dreaming about the next time im gonna go in the variety they have is awesome i originally wanted to try all of them and got a good start then found a couple favorites the chicken tiki masala one is phenominal and the potato soup is to die for
affordable steakhouse for 4 groups
and while you would think that a place that is known mainly for their drinks would have mediocre food  youre wrong
everything has been a win so far
serving was great food was meh
i love culinary dropout
this place is wonderful and derserves 5stars because they have the amazing coffee with houseroasted beans and amazing pastries and sweet treats
having so many options confuses me
im obsessed with their cheese platter and have found a new favorite cheese with their new monte enebro  amaze
the 1970s motif really adds to the vegas ambiance
he had the mac n cheese i am anticheese but he liked it
i hate to say it butmeh
props to the chef and this restaurant
hier ist nicht nur das personal authentisch vor allem das essen aus dem wok
draft selection was limited and there seemed to be a wet moldy smell to the bar
the pablo crusted samosas are just the right level of spicy for even someone who enjoys mild indian flavors to savor
nice and hot and my order correct
the presentation was even horrible
we shared the place with 20somethings 30 40 and 50somethings
felt like i was eating a steak
so dessert came and we decided to let the creme brle sit there on our table until the rest of our sushi came
no part of the chicken is spared
the bun is exceptional and melts with the burger
we waited like 15 minutes for a bartender to finally give us attention only to find out that the free vodka drinks ended at 11pm it was after 1130 at that point
the sommelier was moderately helpful in the end but during the process of selecting a wine she continuously suggested wines that were clearly out of the price range we were looking
will definitely be coming here again
only specialty rolls are half off
i only come here when troy is there because of his experience as a bar tender and customer service
also by enclosing the area and making it more or an attraction it has attracted more people
but smaller batches of food would be hotter and tastier
tvs everywhere beer is super cold people are nice prices are right on for the quality so what else do you want
tried mad greens for the first time today
i loved it
for a highend sushi establishment in the middle of the city i expected much better in terms of quality and presentation both of which were just average
if youre in the area stop by but definitely dont make an effort or go out of your way to eat here
all was delicious
maybe you should change your lunch advertised hours to 245 instead
cooked to perfection crispy onions bun toasted and the flavor was impeccable
tomatillos were absent from an entree that was supposed to have them
go on certain days and youll run into the incredibly hot and super sweet bartender who is very knowledgable on everything in the kitchen as well as all drinks at the bar
we decided to sit outside on a beautiful night and they have a cool bar out there and lots of tvs
sushi was ok  nothing special
great serving sizein fact it was so big i couldnt finish it
they were so light and fluffy on the inside
i always feel so refreshed after eating here
i was really surprised at how many people were there eating
great dinner
sehr schnell und kompetent mit viel freude
i dont think ill be going back to this place but if you are on a budget you might want to give it a try
on a recent search for chinese restaurants that deliver in this area i stumbled on dao kitchen asian bistro and when i saw their menu i was instantly drawn to egg foo young new york style
definitely different but very good
vibe is hipsterhippie
it took another 1520 minutes to get it back to the table as a wrap
mexican food has gotta give you a kick in the buttand i mean that in the nicest way possible
awesome food great atmosphere
if the owner reads this please fix the grub  this would be a great neighborhood place if the food wasnt so god awful
no other way to put it like it was spoiled or contaminated
the plaza can be tricky to park but they do have an underground parking
the uni was top quality also
this takes forever as well
server was very slow and wasnt attentive
initially they seemed attentive and very fast with the food but they skipped our row when ordering and only came back after serving the entire theater and even after that they still missed me
see i was in town for some preseason baseball and hiked up camelback for a little exercise
the one thing that is keeping me from 5starsing them all over this here yelp is that at least two items we attempted to order they were out of
i dont play video poker but i appreciate the plight of those that are trying to keep their health while doing a little gaming
and lets discuss the comfort none
billy was very attentive and brought alley a bowl of water
after that i had just 1 of the tacos  it was the days special a duck meat but i forget what else was in it that was absolutely fantastic
maybe i should next time
ive had much better steaks at several other places
it was ginormous
topped with way too much old blue cheese the salad has some fresh ingredients the chicken was ok and some not so fresh the lettuce was a few days past crisp
it is not fine dining
i opted for a local beer there craft beer list consists of something for everyone
cant wait to go back to vegas just for some stk
i tried the spicy salmon maki but found it lacked being spicey
that price is pretty outrageous for just a bean and cheese burrito with no meat but the main point is if the girl taking my order was actually paying attention she would have heard that i wanted a wet burrito with rice and beans on the side
we have no issue at all of making snacks a full meal
i highly recommend the pretzels
so i was craving something sweet and had to find a place near work
it was a great light starter
theres also some deals like 2 off an acai bowl or 3 for a 16oz drink that you get through the app
while neither beer was bad neither was great
we tried the hefe dog hamburguesa chicken taco and carne taco at barrett jackson
i feel guilty sending overcooked steaks back hey the cow gave its all for the steak  dont throw it away  good thing i got the chile rub  that made it acceptable
bearded bartender man explained why that was the case and it may or may not have involved the coincidence with the apocalypse and the mayan calendar but obviously i must have killed those brain cells
the yellowtail sashimi we ordered was fresh crisp and what id hoped for
too many other great choices for theaters in our area to settle for this type of nonsense
i figured ill write a review
first glance at the menu was overwhelming  there were way too many things that sounded delicious
das es da viele schikis gibt kann auch ich besttigen
complimentary bread basket with the most amazing butter spreads
auch dem attraktiven  gewlbekeller den man ber eine kleine treppe erreicht entrmt kein  typischer kellergeruch wie man das sonst hufig antrifft nheres siehe homepage impressionen
i  had to wait to long to be seated with no greeting
bartender is cute
great customer service
the rep suggested happy 25th birthday william and i agreed even better
we enter and right away i noticed the dust hanging from the fire sprinkler
the wings are bomb
pretty sure ill be a daily customer
the pizza is really outstanding new york style
who knows they may bring it back
the drinks are amazing
for a while we kept getting one very bad server
he was also serving the large group near us but he literally did not once stop by to ask how our meal was going
the two owneroperators are friendly  informative and respectful
the seating is comfortable and amenable to hanging out and talking with people
i ordered the combo 1 which was a taco and a cheese enchilada
plate six was mediterranean stew in deconstruction  prawns  bronzinni  sofrito the first of the more modern tapas
the fish is incredibly fresh
the hostess told us that we could go have a drink at rush lane and she would call when a table was available
we had garganelli which was pretty good the rigatoni lamb verde decent and the linguine clams
if these are the types of things they do in plain sight with the kitchen just a few feet away from the dining room one can only wonder what types of things go on that the guests dont see
cincinnati syklinemeh
i know im not alone in this
the owner is really awesome and friendly as well as the staff and they make you feel welcome i imagine its how rachel ross chandler joey phoebe and monica felt in friends when they would go to central perk
some of us ordered the sausage nachos and were underwhelmed
lol  once we made it to the hibachi grill the waitress took our orderbeing vegan i asked if they would be able to avoid the egg in the rice once i said that she immediately offered all suggestions for me to eat
to the manager of jj madisons your front of house especially your bartenders are losing you business because at this point i will deter anyone who says theyre going to this place by begging them to go literally anywhere else thanks to how they have not once not twice but 3 times ignored their local clientele
im currently sitting here wondering if the bartender is also playing server tonight
everything was arranged so beautifully and i was really touched with how careful the host and hostess were in making sure we were in exactly the right place
i would never go out of my way to visit this store  if there is one even a mile or two further away try there first
i challenge any meat eater to try this dish there is nothing to not love on this plate
the beer is cold
id be content to never go back
i dug into the steak first which i had ordered medium
when i asked why she didnt bother to let me know that when the waiter brought back the bill she just looked at me and said no one told you
i was a bit worried about my recommendation on first arrival as we were seated within earshot of a man who sounded like he was trying to wrestle an aggressive squirrel that had loosed itself inside his throatusing his throat
we were seated upstairs and the warmth factor ratcheted up to 11 it was uncomfortably hot upstairs
i even think this place is worth the drive if you arent on this side of town
try the ebi mayo tiger prawns in spicy mayo sauce they are to die for
lo and behold im flying through clt and what do i spy
i wasnt a fan of our proximity to the door so i asked if we could be moved to a high top
staff are good
really cool to see such great acts right in front of you
the thai iced coffee and mango and sticky rice was average but enjoyable
one of my favorite sushi places in vegas
that is not to say that the other waitresses are not polite
we tried a couple of the sausages i had a bite of each since i was so stuffed from everything else
ill report back after trying the food
tried a few different beers which were good
its more of a 35 for me but i will round up in this case
it looked to me that the cook forgot to put italian sausage on the pizza
the gm in training chip showed our party a great time  knowledgeable service in both wine and food  awesome patio for casually sipping malbec while eating disgustingly bad for you bruschetta
its a hole in the wall that feels like a vegas secret
i usually dont stay in this area long and head upstairs
it was just bursting with flavor and juices mmmm so good
this is the best giant eagle i have ever visited
good thing to have so many beers and eats and great sweet potato fries
overall there was about 1517 people in the restaurant with what looked to be 1 waiter who didnt really give a darn about customer service
the italian thing sort of doesnt jive with the public house thing and it confused me
worst italian food ever
loved everything about this place
super friendly staff awesome food amazing atmosphere
oh and this little detail may be small to others but i truly appreciate the bottles of unagieel sauce available at the bar for us who like sweet instead of salty soy sauce
i asked the bartender to make me a sunday walk in the park
highly recommended
hands down the best chips and salsa ive had
there were 3 of us and they sat us inside at a huuuge booth big enough for a large party
if you want to go for their treatment this seems as good as any for a lower price
came here for a weekend visit to pittsburgh and they completely spoiled our night
i had a simple question about a particular drink and she misinformed about the availability
i visited townhall for the first time today for lunch
i ordered the 5 handroll assortment and they were super small and flavorless
we were in such a hurry that we could send it back
great beer selection but as far as the food and service goes maybe we were there on a bad day
however ive been here several times and always impressed with the chefthe brown bag chicken sandwich is perfectly balanced
i love the concept and the food is executed superbly
their drink selection is nice and to top it off the place is so quaint and cute
she had nicely explained the menu to us but when we reminded her she forgot one of our drinks ginger beer her attitude kicked in
eight dollars for four pierogies is hilarious
weve been to vegas before and had better sushi at other places
id be surprised if there was even an ounce of aristocrat premix in it
next thing the table next to us which sat down after we sat down got drinks and everything
if their intent was to recreate the offerings of the original they failed
we waited in line for 2 hours
i ordered the short rib burger and it was nothing but a big disappointment
nothing spectacular about the food
the quality is okay it is fresh but 495 for a taco de asada that we were told we big is too much
it was boring
and simply had frozen pees and vegetables
jenna was our server and she rocked it
i wish i knew the main wasnt open otherwise i wouldnt have wasted my time or money
salad was huge and ok did have lots of chicken but chicken was bland and breading was awful
every time it opens you blasted our table and the others with cold snowy air letting people in and out
no doubt about it we will be back
service is quick
great tomato sauce over it
as a paying customer for a hookah drink i expect to have the opportunity to finish it
after going here countless times i am afraid my bf and i will not be returning
price is a bit high which i can expect when eating out but overall i see myself coming back since the food was great especially the enchiladas
it is inside the 277 perimeter and not far from the skyscrapers of uptown
great seats and we both ordered cocktails and the angus trio sliders
the desert came wa running pool of ice cream waiter didnt care
dont ask me the name of it
best sushi ive had in a while
a wellplaced source once told us that dicks hideaway is the best breakfast in the valley
i couldnt get away from the potato wrapped shrimp
it took him a long time to come to our table to drink us
i highly recommend the croque madame  the drinks
uni was just so freshbutterytasty
great bar with great food and staff
i had a great lunch and would return again
if you find yourself there during one of these aforementioned times try the food
they cook their steaks perfectly cheese curds are so yummy with excellent batter their pasta is made in house i adore their frites and they just nail their desserts
love the island special roll
i ordered a roll and with tax it was about 20
there is definitely a trend on the menu fried everything
my hubby works just around the corner so we nee to head back again very soon
this place is a big roomy open area micro brewery with a sushi bar inside along with many flat screen tv for sports games
something odd was they took cc  but i suppose they might have a lot of ppl order togo and not pick it up
slightly cheaper than other sushi bars in town it was packed so i recommend booking in advance if you plan to go out on a weekend night
comfortable stools nice vibe with wood floors and a copper ceiling
food is a bit bland
cool fun atmosphere
the downside of this location is the service
and thats because surprise
i went there after a recommendation from a random drunk one christmas season and have made a point of going back ever since
you can literally turn in any single direction and there will be a big screen right in front of you its hard to miss any of the shots with that amount of detail and hd quality  bars are scattered across the entire stadium bar so i cant imagine youd have to walk too far or wait too long to get served  private parking lot  tons of pool tables throughout the bar as well as game tables   golfing simulations
he said it was very tasty  he ate the whole thing so it must have been
the spicy sauce on the side delicious
i would have preferred a touch more aggressive seasoning but again i realize mileage may vary
this includes a nine by nine randomly colored lighting square mounted on the wall that i swear was sending me subliminal messages about eating like shit
weve been loyal to them for 2 years and are sad not to be going back
she turned and went back into the restaurant
but not in the winter
we also got free drinks because of the inconvenience
the lamp they have that hangs on the wall above their couch was bent
my wife and her friend got the homemade ravioli alla nina  wow
youve gotta go
their ayce menu is fairly large
saw this place on here and headed over for lunch and a beer
all of us ordered a drink with one couple ordering a bottle of wine
i was totally fine and figured her puny weakling stomach mustve just not been able to handle the onslaught of all you can eat sushi
convenient to convention center bagged lunchcounter service if youre dining in head to somewhere else maybe chloes nearby for good service and more flavor
we werent ignored when we needed something but there wasnt a real connection with anyone
i understand needing to eat but do it in the back of the house
make sure yo ger your ticket validated
staff wasnt horrible but they werent too friendly
the vodka and seven
now that i have had a chance to try different items from the menu i can now chime in on oak  embers
next came the chicken tostadas and ancho braise short rib tacos
the manager did come over and say that he tasted my salad and it was how they normally serve it
steak and eggs tacos chicken and waffles and breakfast hash
this place is a dump
even when we left at around 6pm the place was barely half full
ive tried and tried but just cant seem to ever catch this place when anything is ever going on
but i live across the street and the bar is still open
i give it a 4 star rating because of the service however i really want to give it a 5 star just based on my dish
the candied strips of hot pepper garnish was so good i could have eaten a bowl of them
except i popped a royal today after being in vegas for 10 years
i absolutely love that most of the menu is glutenfree
i came to visit my dad from out of town and he took me to this local spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat
the omelet i tried was also very nice
i went up and talked to a guy i said i am paul but a party of 4  he said i was just testing you really that tells me you can not take the right number down
yes it was expensive 175 including tip for 2 people but totally worth it if for no other reason because of how good the filet was
food was delicious
but smells yummy
i have never had this anywhere else to compare but i was so happy i ordered this dish
lol ive been served appetizers before mains beverage orders never arriving and other peoples food
so terrible that we walked out
the steady banter of patrons immersed with the sounds of cool jazz
the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce wasnt too sweet
i guess its hard for them to really make a conversation with you when you order through ipad all they do is serve you the food approve the order and then they get on their way
a must visit when going to the cosmopolitan in vegas
our bartender landon was attentive caring and mixed a dynamite drink
my brother and i were feeling adventurous tonight so these are what we ordered 1 sea urchin dumpling fish cake with some sea urchin on top wrapped into a dumpling steamed
music wasnt too loud
and when the sushi came we were surprised how fishy and unfresh the sushi were
ive taken friends and family here to give them a taste of good food off the strip
if you are looking for charming place with the odd character propped up at the bar this may just become your local
it is very close to my house and i always get great service from the chefs fuji john and yohan
my portions were less that an 8th of what they got  my bread was cocktail size bread and since the space is less the contents on top were an 8th less too and yet i was charged 3 more for it being gluten free
the night we were there there was a variety of clientele from the after work group to families and older couples
and watch tv during your meal
we chatted for a bit
for starters we were quite impressed with the decor a mixture of traditional and modern
dont think youll sit down anywhere
we ended up leaving after they wouldnt do anything for us and went down the road to lindo and had a wonderful time
now to the food
the best part is that they stay open until midnight
the server helped us with the menu as it was the first time in
ill be back every time im in town
the food may be wonderful but if it makes me sick ill never visit again
one of the best places to eat and drink in town
the fritters toojust not great
it was over cooked and honestly looked unappetizing
im so sad im leaving this comment because i really like bentos but our last visit really sucked
this was only our second experience at nc music factory and not enjoying our previous meal at another restaurant there we thought we would try texicali since we love mexican
everything she said to us was lazy slurred and unclear
iv never had any problems with her
not even kidding you it has everything you could possibly ever want at a place like this
i could have eaten an extra bowl of that stuff
over and over again this place has disappointed me and this could be the last time i will come to this location
i havent eaten there very often because i prefer a healthy menu
we decided to try this place a couple years ago on christmas eve
and the staff is really attentive so now i dont really care that i suck at golf cause now its fun
try the acai bowl that was our favourite item
i felt that the carpeting and upholstery is slightly dated and that is as much as i can complain about the dcor because its not like they can change anything else
the next dayfull day was completely without water
the server forgot to bring the salsa at first
i took my mother here to spend time with her
the lobster bisque was gritty cold and had no taste
we got there around 545 on a wednesday and the woman behind the bar was really helpful in pointing us toward a good bottle of wine for only 28
the decor is cool and relaxed and there are fun games like shuffleboard darts old school nintendo big jenga and other various card games
authentic homemade italian food
also the additional charge of 8 for scallops with the pasta is a little steep given the fact that you get just 3 scallops for that
i looked around and now shes with one of the other waitresses gossiping behind the bar
next door to red devil
we were the only ones at a table and there were only 3 yes three other customers at the bar
you get the feel that this place is a neighbourhood gem
the food isnt bad but its not the best considering all the hassle i have to go through
im not a big hookah kinda guy but this location rocks
my wife sent it back
they also serve food from wild purveyors which is right next door
grabbed some drinks and pub grub with a pal on friday night
so far the food is great especially the chicken chilean
a great place to hang out
i went there hungry and almost died before eating
i barely had anything
i was hungry so i ate it all lol
they were happy and attentive
lest just say if you are looking for sushi you can do better anywhere but this place their prices are high
it was terrible
there were at least 20 or more open tables and nobody at the bar
i like to cut them some slack
the food was terrific and the menu is reasonably priced
lunch was pretty good menu had mostly flatbreads and sandwiches and service was excellent
i will list the reasons why i gave this place 4 and not 5 stars
its been quite a while since ive gone back to the yellow griffin
on top of all the delicious food and wonderful sake as well the atmosphere and service were perfect
that would be cool if old town wasnt so full of immature douchebags who take up most of that space with inappropriately stupid stuff
the food is equivalent to any other steakhouse ie
with a name like aleks it couldve been either one of us so im giving them a pass
once you go  youll come back often
hey have really good coffee and whenever im not being too lazy i make it here for breakfast so good
i have been back 6 times and the food is always great
everything was made to perfection and quality you expect in a service town like las vegas
i left unsatisfied and disappointed
both in its preperation perfect and its largeness and its simplicity
the texture is great and the big mound of cheese is just fantastic
my boneless wings looked like breaded chicken pieces literally drowning in wing sauce
for this reason and the fact that the staff is extremely slow i no longer eat there
the menu read goji berry spinach braised shiitake cucumber  pretz sticks
this place is new so we tried it out
total for the order came to 70 plus tip
nice spot for a cold creamy sugar rush
the bf and i were in the mood for sushi and this place popped up as new in our neighborhood
the dj and his music selections help keep stk moving
ils organisent souvent des vnements pour tous les gots
the food was overall just okay
there were two disk jockeys playing over each other and it was house music not what youd expect when you go to a lounge
queso la plancha taco 325 not bad griddled cotija cheese was good topped with a bit of guac and a tomatillo salsa that was heavy on the lime
if im in the area ill stop by again and try something different
i think there were only two or 3 tables that fit 4 people
there should at minimum be a waitress and a separate barista
so yes lets take a strippers word over a combat veteran who fought and served our country
we all have leftovers for lunch today
michael at the desk is amazing and very accommodating
ive only been here 5 minutes
i had the mexican martini and it was awesome super flavorful and not too strong
after the meals which were very good despite my shrimp being a little burned the waitress never asked if we wanted dessert
i was there an hour and a half this last time yeah being punctual effing sucks so ive observed enough to say that these are some of the worst bartenders at a strip property ever
only downside was we waited for our food a bit long cause we went during lunch hour
like i mentioned the place was really busy and they were just trying to get through the night
heheheh boralia tops my list for dinner experiences in toronto so far
not stuffy at all
went in after work anf rhe drinks and beer are great
but listen are the first weeks not very important
we had wonderful service and sat outside on the patio
2 blocks west is an actually good taco place
our servers were super friendly and fun as well
husband had the catch of the day artic char with lemon buerre blanc which was very bland
it is easily the best and most authentic korean food that ive had in scottsdale mainly because there are no other korean restaurants in scottsdale
will definitely come back
fridays is always a good place to get a meal but ive noticed their prices go up
my bfast sandwich was fabulous
postino churn the windsor and federal pizza
ive done the ticketing concept at restaurants in la but tuck is a small place this approach seems a bit pretentious
really the hate was the bathroomshower situation
wellunfortunately this dinner made the flight home to florida so much longer because i was nauseous the entire flight home
towels looked pretty tired and old
try pink lady mr carson
until recently this was my go to hibachi location with decent prices and food
sometimes it was a total and complete rip off
i got the pbee bowl which was absolutely amazing
all you could tell the fish was fresh and full of flavor
you dont add it to your soy sauce like the normal powdery wasabi just add a few chunks on top of each bite
also whats up with the creepysketchy men hanging out at the bar almost every time i am in there presumably making various kinds of deals with each other and ogling anything with breasts
some girl spilled her wine all over some of the girls in our group and some big guy stepped on my friends toenice
such a better atmosphere more attentive and friendlier staff and a much bigger space compared to the other yama sushi location
i left sweaty and sunburned after sitting there for an hour
the rest of the taco was forgettable including the avocado creme which lacked much flavor
inatei really does serve the freshest raw fish around
i do believe i said between chicken and the specials and she started talking about seafood
didnt have high expectations and they werent even met
in fact i wouldnt pay for any of the upgrades and just stick with the small cup of fries that comes with your burger
mine was the cauliflower but i have to say they were all spectacular
the rice in its own bowl
it was packed when we got there and we had a short 10 minute wait
die sandwiches die auf der website gelistet waren fielen jedoch nicht so ganz in mein beuteschema
she is an experienced hostess for hooters and is a great representation of the chain
for the size of the hotel and yes its pretty large nearly 400 rooms i dont expect there to be a high staff to guest ratio
atmosphere was great
alex is probably one of the best bartenders you can get
we were immediately greeted by a young girl bartender who easily took brad  trents order
however they were out of several beers
theres hip hop in another room  the music the people and the energy were awesome
the texas fries appetizer came with too many jalapeos but they were easy to remove
i think my favourite moment was when we asked the gentleman for the dessert menu and he said no and walked away completely straightfaced
the new place in champaign is fine
with overpriced food treating your customers badly and behaving thoroughly unprofessionally and i dont mean relaxed i mean straight up bad its no wonder no one comes this place
lots of art work and games to have customers stay and enjoy more than just their coffee andor tea
such an awesome addition to this historic dilworth neighborhood
my husband i went shortly after they opened and we were the only guests dining in  there was a couple takeouts while we waited and dined their website permits for online orders
they arent usually cheap but its plenty of food to keep me going through the rest of the day
the food was ok and the service was slow
they charge 3 for water wtf
i could tell she did not like her job because prior to setting me she complained about the children that were dining before us and the mess they made
a great date spot or couples night out
im not a dessert eater but k and c enjoyed it
also forgot two of the items with my to go order
i can not come to phoenix and not come here
many many vegetarian options that are just as carefully put together as the meat items
theres not too many ratchets that makes it even more enjoyable
i decided to give them a second chance not because of the service but mainly the food
created by true fans of video games comics and the 80s this place has it all
my visit was on a thursday evening at dinner time
theres also a hidden seesaw and a few more seats behind the fireplace
i do not expect only romaines from my 75 per person deal especially when they are not even fresh
the broth was so good
totally relaxing and fun environment with a twist
there are picnic tables and some high tops plus a bar area
originality  nothing special mediocre  service we were the only people there and another couple literally waited for 30 minutes for just sushimi and another 10 for the rolls
they both were extremely bland and tasted like there wasnt any seasoning on the burger
dumb and dumber reference
a group of 4 people got up and left and i quickly made my move to reserve the 4 seats
little pricey 15 but worth it
good food very fast service very attentive
very frustrating when youre told up to 45 mins and it ends up being 115130 no explanation
who likes to take care of every customer
after the manager talked to us our waiter barely came by our table he wouldnt even make eye contact when he walked by
was this place better than those no but it quite close and at a fraction of the cost
we were seated immediately
it felt a lot worse at the time
as we were taking our time to select from our very limited choices the girl was just messing around on her phone
bad sashimi  my husband ate many sashimi he had a stomachache and throw up at mid night
there are seven exclusive vip chambers to hold your private party
a friend and i came here for restaurant week
very nice bright and quiet environment where you can have a formal conversation with a colleague
this was a huge let down to drive an hour for this
sushi samba has really improved its service since our last visit
the bartender asia form here on out took my drink order and suggested other liquid treasures
three of us ordered fish and chips
somehow our order got misplaced so the rest of our order didnt get started till i asked where our mozzarella sticks were
maybe not the most enjoyable way to drink a beer but definitely the cheapest
i started off with a perfect champagne cocktail and thats what it was perfect
it made me enjoy japanese food again given theres a lot of japanese food thats just sloppy now
cool place to hang out
ok so i love thai food
for the little kid in you try the grownup grilled cheese sandwich which comes with a cup of tomato soup that is not what you grew up with
the food is mediocre at best and the service was the worst i have experienced
once for a christmas dinner once for lunch and more recently another night coerced by friends to go for a drink after our exercise class which felt really uncomfortable as it was a thursday night and everyone was really dressed up apart from us in our running gear and cycling helmets with us
good health good luck and happiness for today and every day
i am not commenting on our chefcook because i could tell he was new and not well trained
quality has gone way down from when they opened
completely over priced
the food is delightful and reasonably priced
keep up the good work
we looked around for our waiter who was once again behind the bar
the staff is always friendly and make great margaritas
there are face masks made with fresh produce  they have a sell by date about a week later they are wonderful but you do need to remember to put them in the fridge and use them up before they go off
good natured rivalry and lots of interaction
there was only on server which was hard to order  faster than usual but she was nice
at this time the menu seems more skewed towards traditional french dishes than louisiana style cuisine
so disappointed because i love good fried rice
just what i needed
definitely will go back
i kept the cork in hopes of trying to find it at a retail location
for the price you pay for the toppings50 cents for boba  65 cents for jellysthey sure dont give enough
thank goodness they have free valet service
cocktails  my drink is generally a blood and sand
did not get a lap dance this time since we were just testing the waters there
out of the six clubs ive been to in vegas this one is my favorite
the wasabi octopus and cold soba noodles were awesome
the waitress declined and read out our order which was accurate
i also loved their gnocchi and short rib
which we did and they sat us at a booth which was awesome
i will visit again
a spanish picnic with the best pesto in town
great food service and environment
yelp special is 1 dollar for a pint and foursqaure special has a 25 cent pint special nice
yes it was
the pickles were a pleasant side pairing with the richness of the egg yoke
they constantly kept the drinks flowing and the water topped off
pretty long wait15 hrs but it just opened
average bottles are in the 300s
lightly battered asparagus asked for no pine nuts and tons of lobster
i have eaten here multiple times and never have i had such a bad experience
highlights  tacos steak salad  and some serious drinks
some of my favorite rolls beyond the daily specials are the rainbow cant go wrong there and the scallop bomb
also be sure to clarify if you want sushi or sashimi
i was a bit disappointed that the patio didnt have any misters at all as it was damn hot if you werent out under the terrace where they have some cool ceiling fans and the music was really quite loud even outside though to be fair i think the booth we chose was right under a speaker
came here for the first time although the place is a great venue the meat was kinda dry and over cooked
great craft cocktails sometimes they do 30 off gins and whiskeys not sure if its certain days or hours but check out the sign on your way to the bathroom where you can 58 gins and whiskey well drinks
i am such a fan of this place
le service est bon cest sur que quand le lieu est plein il est plus difficile dattirer lattention dun serveur mais loin dtre impossible donc tout se passe bien
she gave solid recommendations on the food and was a very down to earth person
we held our rehearsal dinner here on the second floor
we werent in a rush
will definitely come back
the food is so fresh and such a variety to choose from
thats way too long
for me the chips is just a vehicle for the salsa to ride so i always go thru a lot of salsa
one of the dancers was being rude to one of my girlfriends  thought that was very unprofessional
my friend always get the rib eye potroast and the bites i have had were quite good
cool spot to chill
keep up the good work
the salad was ok i prefer a ginger dressing that tastes like ginger
upon being sat it took us multiple times of asking people to get a waiter so that we could order drinks and food
once inside it didnt feel so much like a mall restaurant
if youre asking how can they run out of ramen
there is a loungerestuarantchilling area with a bathroom on the bottom floor
the one piece of nigiri had the hair looped under it and sticking up
we split the calamari and the endless soup salad and bread sticks
ive never had a bad meal or service here over all the years ive visited
i fell in love
it melted in my mouth and i savored every last bite
it kind of reminds me of the entrance to a disney ride which always excites me
this place is not for the average scottsdale bar hopper but in small doses and given the right mindset it can be kind of fun
side note  please be sure to ask about the kids menu available
the details from the skulls behind the bars to the star wars themed darth vader and the clone troopers drawing on end
its main even is a free pub quiz on monday nights at about 8pm which is worth checking out especially as there are usually prizes to be won
this place was so great
yeah so kristophers isnt fine dining
dont have the expectation that you will have traditional sushi
i wish this place was closer to where we live but then if they were we would never have any money
the salad has spinach mushrooms hard boiled egg croutons and radishes
we were attending a show in the hotel and chose dvino for our dinner
the first of the two visits they sat my family very quickly
heard good things about this place their food cool place downtown blah blah blah
he was even able to get me an upgrade on my table right on the dance floor in front next to the dj for the same price as a lower end vip
only catch is this place has no appetizers whats so ever
my only dislike ever was their pasta and thats a personal sauce preference
i asked if my man who is 6 7 could fit and the response was yes these were built for athletes and will hold someone 7 feet tall
the atmosphere was cool too very irish pub like their name suggests
they were meltinyourmouth delicious and very similar but i liked the stacks better personally
there is two patios one with a water feature and the other has a fireplace
he ended talking back to me telling me i was taking my time with the menu
highly recommend it
we all left satisfied
die toiletten finde ich auch sehr schn gestaltet
being such a nice day today i went with a friend who has a small baby
before this location was here we would have to venture out into the downtown core
there was a fruit fly in the cream
seemed like a fire hazard
food was okay and by okay i mean average american asian style very greasy
after our dinners were delivered 30 minutes after the appetizer was finished
every time i attempt to go here again and relive the love i once had for it i am disappointed
bonne bire
one things for sure this place is busy
ok service and the wings tasted good
clean and friendly however the service wasnt great
im still trying to figure that out
it had lots of crab and very little filler
we had a wonderful dinner  my butternut squash ravioli was to die for and the service was superb
major polite smirk
pizza dough is amazing but the toppings could be a little more varied
my wife and i love this place close to home and located in the beautiful tivoli village
impossible to find but the food at this place is legit so good
we also saw a jugglerslashcontortionish
and it tasted like strawberry jelly
this dish however fell so short that it brought me great sadness
we walked out went next door to the red robin and had a fabulous experience there
if youre going to do that take that sign out on the front
those of you who know me know i love a good bar stool and even better i love a good bar
strawberry baked alaska my favorite
we came here on a sunday night an hour before closing
i can never remember her name but the bartender with that adorable face and red hair is the best weve ever had at that bar
second time around i went with the pork bulgoki
je suis dfinitivement en amour
however if you love picture taking youll have plenty of spots to choose one
had to meet someone here
my recommendation for eats is the plantain chips
service  polite but we felt no care attitude from our waiter
the fish quite fresh
drinks were delicious and not overpriced and the atmosphere is so fun
i tried almost all of their sushi rolls
i really hope this place doesnt shut down like an article i just read said
the only reason for not having 5 stars would be that there are zero pics of how their sushi would look like before you order  its like a surprise in a box  i had to refer to trusty ol yelp to give me a sneak preview
he said to get people to come to the club
sunday night in need of a beverage and a snack waitress suggested pretzels
my friend and i came here for dinner we got buffalo chicken wings and the nachos
went during the day and night
i appreciated that this roll wasnt made with a plethora of rice just as filler but the paperthin pieces of fish were almost tasteless
but not so pricey that you wouldnt go back because the food is worth it
we did leave just before 2am and found a guy passed out on the sidewalk just outside the door but hey maybe he just had a long day
normally i never take out a bad placefoodambiance on a server but tonight she just made it worse
everything was prepared beautifully
the server staff is just the best  awesomely attentive interacting and fun to talk to
so aside from a few hiccups the club was pretty cool
nice staffs good interior design with great sushi man
we ordered a dogfishhead 60 minute a manhattan and a butcher sour my drink of choice
food was unreal
i have heard that the wings were good though
die bedienung kann noch etwas dazu lernen der junge kellner war freundlich und sehr nett
at least they are consistently good
will definitely  recommend aroma
asked if they could use a clean knife to make my wifes veggie rolls so it wouldnt be contaminated with fish
the offer from coastal taco seemed like a great value guacamole 2 salsas a taco tenpack and dessert for 30
the place is cozy and dim which would have been more relaxing if the music had been softer and chill  they were piping in some loud housetechnowhatever it was
the pub seems to be hugely popular with the away supporters which is good as it allows the chance for the home and away supporters to have a friendly chat with each other and banter about the predictions for the forthcoming game
i got prime rib medium
i argued saying we reserved for 30 but she said our ticket says 40
i was so full at this point that i couldnt try the cake
they have food too but i didnt check that out this visit
good beer selection
great filet mignon dinner
thankfully one of the servers noticed that my bread was gone and brought me some more so that i could enjoy more of the yummy curry broth after all my mussels were gone
lets wrap this review up with my most recent visit  brunch
butthe server tj was awesome
the room is a bit boring and plain jane
honestly its just like an englishirish pub
the quality is not good
the daquiris are always good and by the end of em you usually feel a fuzzy sensation in the tips of your toes
three of these an angry mistress i tried pawning off as an unpaid vendor and a wife with a penchant for sharp cutlery doesnt make for a good happy hour let alone happy anything
it was so hard to focus on the dinner menu as we ready to try their cider flight
totally over cooked and under seasoned
you can order for the butterjoint menu or the legume menu
they had great music low enough where you could still hear your friends
food was amazing and ambiance was superb
portions was more than enough waitress was pleasant the care was consistent there was nothing to complain about
i have to say that the service and cleanliness have gone downhill since last time
overall very disappointed and while their menu looks decent we would not dine there again
he explained the situation
our server rick was awesome as well
well try to come back sometime when they do sushi too so my guy can get his fix
airmail rum orange blossom honey lime and sparkling wine
the official name of the upstairs place is called rare but i dont think ive heard anyone refer to it except the person who works there
i was here on 12217 for the championship football games and steve  the blonde lady and sachiyo all let patrons smoke next to the vast amount of customers that were eating
bun bo hue  this was good
the server was very nice and sweet
this dish was everything i wanted
i never do reviews but i had such an awful experience that i had to share my feedback
they have waffles and crepes along with their boba drinks and froyo all at very affordable prices
i just wanna dance
she is sooooo helpful has a great attitude  a pleasure to be with
outside patio is amazing in the summer time
even when theyre busy the service is quick and friendly and theyve only gotten my order wrong like once in my 5 years frequenting this place but ill take partial blame for not liking cilantro eheh
im going to start by saying that i really really want this place to be great
i cant recommend lola enough
fullyloaded with layers of toppings and cheese the nacho platter was literally the biggest platter ive seen in my life
not only did we not have one they had us sit with another group in a confined area where they added another makeshift table in the middle of the aisle where not only could we not get out of but also created a safety hazard
food was pretty meh but its expected
someplace close instead of traveling down to little italy
the pad thai is a bit more sour than what you would find in other places but i liked it more because of that
and even breakfast items
bottom line there was nothing wrong with the food but im not going to go home and crave the food from bachi burger
get it together
i had a couple beers listened to the music and called it a night
this is my goto place for food and drink in kensington market
the appetizer section has cold items that you would not expect like saliva chicken that i was admittedly not brave enough to order
ah crazy drunk people
i cant believe the food is only 5 per order
the steak was very flavorful and tender
the stand out though is the food which is high end gastro pub style
i dont like it but sometimes youll have a friend in your group who really wants to go
we will not return to this place  a friend recommended it so we tried it
i didnt particularly like the jambalaya but he said it was very good
the wait from order to food is routinely 40 mins which is slow for even a white table cloth restaurant
thought it would be a bigger buffet
we moved from the room next to the patio because it was freezing in there when a table opened up on the patio
would recommend the fiery scotsman burger amazing the mac and cheese andor the haggis balls
nice selection of sushi professional servers good beers and fast service
so i did some quick googling and saw the pictures on yelp and thought wait a second this might be worth a shot
adding a little to the waist
i always am
nothing stood out for either of us
leave your sushi ego at home because it is a small cozy and convenient neighborhood place
so being an anomaly im considering this point a wash
the injera teff flour spongy flat bread was good but we found it surprising it was not served warm
nice local spot
staff is also very nice  i will be back for sure
my gnocchi starter was tasty although there was rather too much tomato sauce the tuna steak main course was also good but could have done with a potato or two as spinach as the main veg accompaniment was a little bit boring
cocktails are bad
we will be coming back to try many flavors
before i start this review is not about the food  which was excellent
unfortunately the lady waitress didnt bother explaining anything and she just left the tab at the table and walked awayso we assumed all and orderedthe male staff were happy to answer our questionswhile ordering u can see the picture of the sushi and its content once u submit ur order one waiter will bring a print out of ur order to ur table
oysters we ordered a half dozen smelled fishy and didnt taste fresh crab cakes were average and 10 for only 2 small ones
15 for fries and 20 for a burger is not worth it to support someone who does not appreciate his fans
lacked flavor and was very average at best
also great is they have food and really good food too dim sum hummus pizza not your typical bar stuff
come to california please
we will not return
they were nothing short of amazingvery generous portions between three of us one order of vegan nachos filled all of us up
very good sushi at a great price
maybe its just the day of the week but i mean wtf they are now called the horse
the one hiccup was that my wife had her burger the original ordered well while i like some pink and ordered mine medium
and for some reason the butter they give you is an addictive substance of some kind
being the first barcade i had some high hopes  especially after visiting the concept in chicago and other cities
leinwand mit musikvideos es luft aber nie diese musik sondern nur das bild
the tonkatsu ramen was ok but i found the pork bone broth to be a bit bland
being new to the area i appreciate this very much
if i worked uptown this would definitely be a goto for an inexpensive healthy meal
oysters on half shellsmall skimpy oysterspaid for it with an abdominal hurricane the next day
i went last week for lunch with my coworker and i had the burger
i was working on a sunday and saw about 8 roast dinners all made up
they bands were good and the sound was really good
brio is a great place to hang out for happy hour and brunch but avoid dinner service as it takes way too long and the meals are the same size portions as lunch for a higher price
i highly recommend it
it was stale
with the accolades of being on the triple dfood network it was a must try
so i take a few bites of the veggie with some of the rice
my beau and i softly joked that we should be slurping the same piece of spaghetti when he came up to our table
just felt like it last minute when i saw the fish and chips on the menu
omg delicious bowls
if youre looking for real western country bbq to give you that sticky fingers experience this is it
basically this is the kind of place where youll get pretty tasty food but it wont be the most traditional asian food
im all about the fish tacos that they have
was more interested the boozing
the monster box includes a giant sushi burrito and 5 pieces of sushi
but for the most part great place
waste of money
this place is great
whether you prefer nigiri rolls appetizers or entrees this place has it all
im definitely going back sooner than later
it was super delicious and perfectly paired with our cotton candy kisses
ive been here once before but dont think i wrote a review since there are so many
we were in a small room so it was hard to accommodate all of the birthday party guests
uniforms are short skirts for the women and kilts for the men servers
at a tapas place
very cozy on a cold winter night
we didnt actually notice for quite awhile because we were having a fun time talking amongst ourselves but one of us looked at our watch and realized wed been there 25 minutes with no service after the waters we grew a little concerned
the waiters attitude didnt change all night
i will definitely be back
45  stars
our server joshua was fantastic
call ahead for reservations
on a ri toute la soire
fortunately we were sat at a hightop near the bar with regular seats
the crust and the gravy were so good
this place is so amazing that we end up making it a every 5 year anniversary spot
that doesnt even count all the great juices
our server seemed more apologetic and concerned than the manager was
ordered the tuna lover vegas and the alaskan rolls
we can handle bad service at fast food joints but to be treated this way at a high end restaurant is not acceptable because we are also paying for service as well
two people ordering a brie sandwich and burger drinking water
alexis in the bar is one you must visit
now its an old dive bar with a smoker out in front
amazing patio great music drinks and food
service the manager jeremy recognizes us whenever we are there and we love that
we havent seen any yet but plan on it soon
i would definitely come back
ive always loved the keg i find that their food is consistently great no matter which one i go to
worst case scenario if the crowd inside is too much its always fun to hang out on the patio area where the music isnt as loud and it isnt as packed with old town partiers
sadly disappointed in this place  never will try it again
ok so first they messed up my hotdogs i wanted only cheese and when i told them they messed them up they made me new ones but and this is where it gets gross the guy blew in the bag to open it up so me seeing this i said i wanted to talk to manger and she did nothing what a place nasty
we sampled the entire menu each dish was perfect
missing the final touch
food was pretty good
we preordered because of the kids and everything was served promptly and beautifully
dirty nachos think nachos wpotato chips instead of tortilla chips which were also delicious and honestly i cant remember the third appetizer
signed slightly bummed out by the burger bar
i absolutely loved the fried green beans and deviled eggs
nice ambience on patio
as a craft beer guy i was actually looking forward to visiting as this place has been open for over 25 years brewing english styled ales in midtown toronto
phone in over one hour and they will reserve a table
we are always up for trying new stuff so wifey ordered a grape slush kinda drink and instead of going for an avocado boba smoothie one of my usuals i ask for their most popular one which the girl behind the counter says is their peach perfection so i go with that
its like paradise in my mouth
the showers are weird but honestly i make a bigger mess at home with my full shower curtain than i did at this place with the weird open plan shower
to many better places within a stones throw of this place that actually serve good food
beautiful table settings
we had a weeknight dinner at the verandah and it was one of our best eating experiences in vegas for value food quality and service
the bread was served with two kinds of butter salted and unsalted and each of the choices was incredible
they were all delicious and the prices were fair for good drinks downtown
the first time was opening weekend and i waited 2 12 hrs
the sushi chefs are very friendly and willing to chat
ich wrde hier noch mal essen
i would urge anyone to order either of these but all of the burgers looked appetizing on the menu
the taste going down really hit the spot not too brash but enough to show its presence
i can understand what an annoyance it can be to have 2 handfuls of troops come in and ask for the free burger  beer deal
bloody marys are great and usually on special
the ravioli was rich and i really liked the chicken and salmon
we had tuna app buffalo chicken wrap and cobb salad
not worth the hassle
those candied jalapenos up the spice level and compliment the pizza really well
i guess if you are going to drink or for the entertainment it might have others give it more stars
definitely a place to bring your cheapest friend
but i would definitely return and recommend to friends
if there had been more pork belly pieces i would have been happier but they were pretty decent
their lunch deals during the week are filling fresh and a good deal
sort of a dive
i decided to log onto yelp just to write about my dining experience tonight 4917
no apology or explanation
best part rayray excellences advised in a morebritish tasting beer and delivered my husband a guinness and dunn from scotland
there are just so many great choices in vegas
in nature i barely like any of the veggies that are apart of the stuffing
i had no idea this place existed until i snagged tickets to beirut
a bit better than brutopia on the beer front so dont expect delicious beer here
i want to live here
love this hidden gem
service is pretty good
we ordered the vegan specials a buffalo chicken sandwich and a pierogi sandwich
the servers just stand there doing nothing although there were like 2 doing their job
based on the ordertakers recommendation for food for five adults we had barely enough for three adults and what we did have was lacking
great staff awesome prices and wide selection of nutritional needs
strike up a conversation with him and dont be shy
that initial conversation lasted about 20 more seconds than it should have
well not completely true but it is one of the cool things about pittsburgh for sure
the homemade vinaigrette is light and refreshing with a subtle tartness that makes the salad a refreshing meal
the chicken itself was quite difficult to cut and chew a bit overcooked and doesnt seem freshly made
only complaint is tempura shrimp tacos have plenty of shrimp but sometimes lack the other filling
probably worst sushi i have ever had
i ordered only few pieces of salmon sashimi seaweed salad avocado salad miso soup shrimp tempura shrimp skewers teriyaki salmon chicken karaeke deep fried oyster and eel on rice
a surprisingly good fusion of sushi and burgers
this place was bad
ebenso das licht gedimmt wenn der abend fortschreitet
the place was not packed but we were told all the tables were reserved and so we had to sit at a large hightop communal table in the bar area
where to start
my personal favorite is the land of enchantment
people just party harder
table had fried calamari to start and was good as was the free bread
but there is only one little picnic table outside in the parking lot essentially
salads with french fries on top
power location is 100x better and will  continue to go there
i always describe the company store as if we all the patrons were just hanging out and someones really fun house
cons we got here at 5 way before busy dinner crowd and our food took 45 minutes to come out
as i sample small portions of each dishes  my expectation of good looking dishes is melting away
it was good and hot and the roll soft
it looks like a little beer house plunked down next to the mon
the prices seemed a bit steep i mean 27 for spaghetti and meatballs
if it had any of these on it i didnt see or taste any of it hard to miss sundried tomatoes
the service on the other hand eh i would have overlooked it had we not had two similar experiences two days in a row
again for a chain it is what it is but sometimes you just want to relax and order a bottle of red for 25 vs 50 at some fancy restaurant for the same varietal and eat fries
they do not advertise this so the birthday boy asked for a refund for his cover
i had the fish tartare and it was extremely filling and flavourful
very disappointed overall
the burger was tender juicy and was as it should be if you were making it on your own grill at home
thinking about my experience makes me nauseous that i dont think i will be back
the ambience is fantastic and the service provided makes you feel catered to
the food was very bland and boring even for a sports bar
the company was good as well and it made for a nice evening
alley entrance down some stairs low lights comfortable speakeasy vibe perfection
the staff were polite and very attentive and the food was well prepared
the lobster bisque is my husbands favorite
i would definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion
all in all though once things got going we had lots of fun
i know this stuff is hard to find in the valley but had it from a restaurant in phx and though it was spiced up it was bigger tails and not brittle at all
excellent family owned family oriented restaurant
burger and shawarma was very goodhighly reccomended for any occasion
ive grown up and it feels great
seriously vampire tacos and any beer you can dream ofdefinitely recommend
where there is a certain degree of fakeness and you know your being taken advantage of
we did not really spend much time here so i cant speak for what this place might be like during a more happening time
oh but when it did come out i dug in and it was delicious
the bartenders are rude and they try to over charge you
she almost messed up my frienda order but i quickly realized she was talking about the wrong dish
should be 35 stars
i had the ribs and they were excellent
go to holsteins
add it to a wishlist with very very little to speak of
the vinaigrette was not overbearing and the whole meal was delicious and filling
their service is unparalleled
the second time around the steaks were so rubbery i took maybe 2 bites before looking at my friend and saying i give up
the waiter was great
they serve them full of rotten lettuce
1lb burger meat is great tasting not a big fan of the 3 texas toast bread slices on it or the herd fried onions
we were both dressed warm but we were freezing
as with all vietnamese restaurants ive tried so far the appetizers dont seem worth the prices
luckily i was already done with my business
for a late night snack or a tasty brunch this is my 1 when im in vegas
the draft beer was flatstick to the bottles here
this is no reflection on cathryns service as she was trying her best to get it to work and was a star for hospitality and customer service
which i have to say they took off of the menu ceviche apt
very lacking in flavor and texture
one of the few japanese grocery stores in montreal
i usually stick wifi my greens tho  hard to pass up
we ordered the saffron rice pudding for dessert and the rice was not cooked properly plus the cinnamon was overpowering
i wouldnt advise going alone its sketchy
was in vegas for a weeklong convention
the food is authentic and served with the utmost care
very flavorful and just the right amount of spice
i work service industry and understand that on occasions you get rude and sometime intolerable guests and need to vent but speaking poorly about a guest or anything else on your restaurant floor is immature unprofessional and rude at best
i love their smoothies but the staff is horrible
on the plus side our service was great
went to the tiger bar downstairs for a concert and even though there were no more then 20 ppl downstairs it was alot of fun
ive been to victorias a few times before and i think it has a great ambience
i cant believe i even tried to force myself to drink that sht
super slow service
just a smidgen though
came in about 12ish pm on a saturday afternoon and it was quite empty
the menu is definitely tilted towards an english influence which should be no surprise
never leave unsatisfied or hungry
everything was delicious including some of the bartenders
the owner makes some amazing rolls that are sure tickle your taste buds
ie i wouldnt go out of my way to come here for dinner
have been for filet mignon three times and just oohed and awwwd every time
definitely coming back
the downfall came when all the items were so spaced out in timing
the service would receive a 5 star and the food a 35  veronica  ronnie was great
this place is definitely a local place in a small strip mall
i cant wait to come back when the weather is warmer
staff are very friendly
really really wanted to give this place a 5 but the wait was just to long
i must say our group of 10ppl were not disappointed
we love val jess ronda and all the ladies
for a place called hot house the restaurant wasnt very hot
please dont misunderstand though the staff now are still plenty friendly but it just seems like they are either newly employed or frazzled due to the restaurant being at maximum capacity which at most is only about 40 people
check them out for dinner
i mean im not going to just take a whole scoop off her plate
i think its sad that the owner had to make alternative profiles on yelp to give herself 5 stars kinda ruins the usefulness of this service
we went for lunch 22711
there seemed to be no waiting area
it was pretty busy but being vegas they should be used to that so theres no leeway on that sorry
it was hard to save enough for the other girls
now that is quite a long time for anything here in the desert
the sausages on the side werent the shriveled dry ones either
however my experience here was unacceptable and i am appalled that the manager did not even stop by our table
particularly for couples all of the two person tables are right up next to the windows with amazing views
just try this
everything was very well presented and well thought out
there were a few people in line but it goes fast
in addition i would recommend getting the arizona bowl or the eggs benedict i love them
if you had to eat just one food for the rest of your life ferraros lasagna would be an unbeatable choice
if you can grab a hard to get patio table it is the perfect place to enjoy the heart of dilworth
we will be backgotta try the pizza
servers are friendly and easygoing
its hardly a runaway however as pipers does enjoy certain advantages over its corpulent neighbor 1 four
i should probably offer a disclaimer that im not a huge sushi fan but i very much enjoy japanese food otherwise
dress to impress have a profemale group ratio go before 1030pm and it shouldnt be too hard to get in
been here a few times
you will enjoy for sure
check in on yelp and get free order of wings
i took the leap gave it a try and was like damn  thats a good burrito
even though im not crazy about the decor who cares
the old deagans is back
plate presentation was outstanding
classic las vegas
so i go to durants expecting the worst  hoping for the best
i said a quick goodbye to my old classmate and i left feeling i had a great time and a really fun meal
when i got to the hotel they told me they only had smoking rooms and wanted to charge me for an upgrade
our waitress was very nice just a little slow since the service was slow we decided not to eat here
dont let my dads tastebuds shy you away
service ok  not likely to go back
i would still consider onestop to be the best place in arizona for protein shakes or health products but this is another great option
dont order this unless youre a huge fan of beer
at this point ive tried almost all of them and havent had a bad one yet
it was turkey ham and bacon complete with all the other fixings
last time my burger came out cold and over cooked
service was good
service was a bit uneven with varying degrees of friendliness and efficiency
dont do it try city hall
i have to be honest though the boba was very good
service was on point also
the food looked great we cant wait to try the hurricane popcorn think that was the name
unless you like your bacon barely cooked and super soft dont forget to ask for it crispy
arrived in pittsburgh late on a friday and we were hungry
every roll we have ever had here we wanted to order another
beer is good looking forward to the onsite brewing they have some of their recipes for beer on tap but theyre contract brews havent put their onsite stuff on tap yet due to licensing
we ordered the steak tacos and they were supposed to be medium but they were pretty rare
as you walk in there are two sides
and the drinks are really tasty
love the make your own bloody marymimosa bar
service was quick and our bartender was really nice
this is my sons favorite mexican restaurant so i decided to give it a try
its a good goto place for inexpensive bar food and a place to watch the game or celebrate st patricks day with your friends but neither the food nor the decor is  what most people think of as gastro
this review is for the bar and my experience only with rear bar and staff great staff at rear bar
well guess what the system doesnt work by traking my players points i gambled over 200 and did not see a single ticket
i understand that some food will sit longer than other selections but i would say nearly 70 of all the food trays were empty out of about perhaps 80 selections
it is too bad i bought a reward package to this restaurant before checking it out
everything else is neon and posers this bar is almost like a neighborhood bar
cant  wait to go back
naans were cold
dads incredulity that it was being passed off as tomato soup caused him to want everyone at the table to try it
we sat outside but no problems there  the weather was great and the view of the city was nice
both times the hot dogs taste boiled not grilled and were not cooked enough
clean and appropriate decor
waitress was great
but enough about the great desserts which we got bagged to go at the end of the night by the way
the whole concept of sheesha is you smoke it around with light snacks or a drink and you are pretty much making it impossible for people to do it
they had a band playing that night which was pretty good
people are there drinking and having fun so you get splashed hit with beach balls and people jump in right next to you
they have a great wine list and the 04 montrachet chardonnay was fantastic
everyone hated theyre dishes
flavors were very nice and great atmosphere
the music was a little loud so unfortunately it was hard to carry a conversation
the prices were reasonable
we must have had a minimum of 6 checks and he did spectacular at not mixing them up
i didnt realize it was opening week
the scallops tasted like nothing but char and the risotto had crunchy pieces of rice
i got to try some of my friends bucatini carbonara and tomato  burrata
ive been coming here for years and the jester room kept me heretheres a bartender named kelly that is a total pro with a beautiful smile and service that is always on point their live music and excellent service keeps me coming back
never had to wait for water to be filled up
i like hot but this was a bit much
it wasnt overly great wasnt bad
went there on a wednesday for a buck a shuck on oysters
continuing on with multiple appetizers crunchy golden lobster potstickers were served in a mild spicy togarashi miso butter sauce
food is overseasoned which makes it salty but the ambiance is nice
on the notsogood side when i visited a while ago their selection for vegetarians was notably lacking
fun atmosphere for adults
its pretty insulting if you ask me
my husband and i are were born and raised in hawaii
ate one italian and one beer brat with super caramelized onions mild kraut and mustard and then ordered another beer brat as couldnt get enough
this is not first class seating on an overseas flight to dubai
even for me a big eater one meal combo gets me hella stuffed
we watched a movie had the reclining seats  comfortable but not worth the price by any means we reserved seats online which came with another price really making it expensive
this is where i take people when they are here to visit
ive had several food items on the menu over my many visits including the tavern salad stacked with veggies and mixed greens always satisfying appetizers and munchies and several sandwiches and hoagies turkey club reuben classic burger and of course the fish sandwich
great discussion about beer
the only downside is that seating is first come first serve and can sometimes be hard to find but all in all its a great unique place to dine
tastes like well water
they straight up wouldnt let me get chicken fingers cause i was over twelve this is bullshit i just wanted my damn chicken fingers
if you smoke than by all means keep sucking on those cancer sticks
even the dessert i wanted mochi and she said it was only available for the dinner price
they will make a tab for you if you dont want to get for credit card or interact card all the time
the lobster salad on wheat was to die for
after we all paid to get in  she said we werent allowed to split the tickets unless everyone came  which is fine  cool  i get it
id come back def
its a great night to end the weekend in vegas
the first thing i noticed was how cheap it was
if youre a beer drinkerthen youll like the down the hatch club which one has to earn to be in
the taste and how they serve its
my sister came to visit from houston so after we visited the bechtler museum of modern art we walked down to ko
we wont make a point of going back but you could do worse
when we mentioned this she mumbled something and walked away
my friend had a bone in filet  best steak weve ever had
the tortilla egg and potato specialty was very unique
waited 5 mins before we got noticed
you can spend 400 at nobu or sushi samba but the food wont be any better than it is at yonaka
only down fall was when they had to move us to a corner table downstairs around 3am cause the top floor is closed but thats okay cause we had a blast up there
i also like the creative cocktail menu
we recently stayed at the gaslight inn for a high tea bridal shower that my mom and i hosted
i had the jambalaya
if i could give zero stars i would
most important they had no ac
i was very underwhelmed
this guy literally fell down drunk and was picked up by og staff
i still found the place over priced
accessible from all sides and just as comfy as the tables or lounge
i am not one for sushi and not a huge fan of the whole blowfish phenomena
the servers know their food is spicy and they are on their game
it was pretty busy in there but she still made sure we did not see the bottom of our glasses
had big breakfast here early one morning and it came out fast
it wasnt bad but it wasnt special either
however the burgers taste fantastic
like the goodwich carson kitchen other mama or glutton
next is food quality
i was gonna leave it and get my money back but i was hungry
if youre looking for a quiet intimate restaurant to have a nice date night or want to support small local businesses cafe 157 is your place
the hummus was about average and the salad was decent although the dressing was a little sweet for my taste
drinks are fabulous
the place was pretty dead save for a handful of tables
it was wings that doesnt take long
just updated their rating to 55
u can easily walk by this place along queen west because the frontage is quite narrow
my mom and i ordered sushiwith the restaurant week menu we had our choice of two rolls  one regular and one specialty
they are in the same vein as tgi fridays and olive garden
the kids love choosing their sushi and pulling it off the conveyor belt
i have to admit that i am stuck of 3 of the dishes there so you wont get much try this or try that from me i go for  the limone chicken the 12 lemon roasted chicken and the shrimp and lobster fettuccine only with angle hair stick with these 3 and you wont go wrong
couldnt really see how fun this experience was
we were in az visiting out for thanksgiving and really wanted so go az mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some margaritas
with in a couple minutes the serves brings us a little bowl of chef soup amuse bouche it was very nice complex flavours of mushrooms baby noodles seaweed and not sure what else
being an american in edinburgh its so hard to find a good wrap and a decent selection of draft beers along with a cocktail menu
the parking is still as bad as ever we did find a space
if the theme is southern go southern
triple stack enchiladas were next level awesome
love this place this is my neighborhood bar
my wife made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we had to wait
thank you all so very much for making the day soooo special
the chicken wings are really good though
fresh ingredients steaks cooked to your liking and perfection friendly service all combined with a contemporary soothing decor
i was surprised but whatever
however they were extremely crowded and we waited for 30 mins and the waiter never came to take our orders
one of my favorites was eddies special that had both spicy tuna and spicy scallops on top of a crunch roll
im all for a fun night of dancing so it was fun for me but anyone who was hoping to hookah would have been potentially disappointed
service and food was good
i have a toddler attached at my hip most of the time and taking the time to prepare meals is sometimes extremely inconvenient
so we went to try the beer
they have a house stereo but its kinda shitty and doesnt play loud
wait staff was apathetic slow and unpleasant
the servers answered all of the questions we had about their craft cocktails and gave great recommendations
glad i didnt order anything else because that appetizer served as an entree for me
just avoid yelp directions
i can pretty much dance to any type of music
they have some standard burger configurations from 12 to 65 but they also have a make your own section
the ribs sometimes dont have enough smoke but the meat falls of the bone and still has great flavor
the smell on the lobby floor smelled like stripper perfume nothing against strippers or there perfumes mixed with cigs and perm
i dont know when we will be back but i wont order that salad and i will call and ask about the show
whether you get the patty melt or the garlic burger these are well worth the 6 that you spend
it is christmas eve and we are that coupleno kids no family in town dont eat meat so instead of cooking we took advantage of a coupon for dos juevos and i was very impressed
it was done to perfection and was very good
we called three times
it wasnt very busy
will come over and over
i finally got a soft drink even though i ordered an iced tea
three drink menus and a dinner menu
a group of us came to wasabi for a birthday dinner on a busy saturday night
when the waiter knew there was no need to earn his tips he stopped trying
still great food and amazing service
drinks were good as was the serive
this place makes really great pizzas
they have a great selection of drinks service is always quick and staff always friendly
i was there last night for dinner with 3 others and being a week night it was very quiet and we basically had personal service all night
the food is average at best but their 5 pint specials are a big draw for after work
thats about all of the goodthe bad
my friends had to lift me up 4 steps just so we can hang out
now ive been a bartender  waitress since 2004 and im shocked and very understanding so now i go here just order food and call it a day
we received a single smallsized artichoke cut in half brushed with oil grilled seasoned with sea salt and served with lemon aioli
it has a very cool vibe for nostalgia
it is set to far away from the bar
they actually left the stain glass bench seating at entry way and the alter in the front which displays their equipment for brewing their beers
he said it was kind of bland
it is a little pity
got a tix4tonight coupon and went here at 9pm after a show
i actually really like their wings however wanted to share a terrible customer service experience
friendly bartenders and locals
love their salads its the perfect work lunch
if we had had 3 hours to kill and another night at our hotel we might have hung all day there
great meal great service
what was good is the hawaiian style lokomoco breakfast
very delicious food from calamari to pizza
it was pretty good the sauce gave it a sweet tangy flavor which made this one pretty unique
prices are reasonable
first time at hartwood restaurant and everyone in our dinner party 6 in all were impressed not only with the quality of the food but also the unique ambiance of the restaurant and its attentive and knowledgeable wait staff
thats all we tasted salt
normally alot of times at other places karage just comes in some sort of shape
the place seem decent and the service was good
every hour or so they blast foam bubbles onto the dance floor
always remember us when we go in
i ended up being included with the 4 besides me not really a big deal but my beer ended up on a table at the other end
my problem with simon is that the restaurant needs updating badly
ive never actually eaten at dom demarcos just ordered takeout
i was dressed in nice clothes and i dont know if thats a bad area or not because i go through mesa from scottsdale to go to and from work
it was one taco for petes sake
highly recommend the sushi lollipops and the gyoza
not too shabby
while the service can be a little casual it is very friendly and it is such a comfortable place to hang out and have an incredible brat root beer or beer and pretzel
it was empty
i met the two wonderful helpful kind business owners
i will certainly return to the mission
also took my husbad here right before he started 3rd year of medical school for a rest and relaxtion day
the chocolate cake will keep us coming back
rule all of the peasants with your perfect breakfast order
unfortunately were out of towners but are so hoping they set up shop near us soon
place is somewhat clean not the  friendliest staff barely seem to speak english when we went
i hope this shines some light on some issues at this location
my take on this place is that the great coffee and other unique refreshment are there just to get you in the door once inside its all about connection
guess ill have to try another pok place
my wife had a club sandwich with fresh hand cut fries
the restaurant was empty when we first came in
enjoy i think
i got the pineapple amaretto and its pure yummy with an extra shot
it is a five diamond 2michelin star rated resturant so i had very high expectations coming in
i went in with a buddy a couple weeks ago and most of their menu had pot references
it gets a second star for ambiance it could have had three maybe if the prices dropped about 35
and i loved the the decor and i enjoyed the ambience
the fried clams were a little chewy but still tasty
i mean really the deal should be your choice of potato for no extra charge
summary certainly worth a try again an absolutely hit on one dish a slight miss on another
he did a build your own with the jalapeo bacon pepper jack and pineapple
it was still delicious
dont pass up the garlic mashed potatoesnegative thingso noisy we had to repeat our orders to the waiter several times this resulted in getting the wrong more expensive bottle of wine
there is also another room just a stairstep and halfwall away with darts and high top tables
the drinks are wellmade and the food is good and the occasional live music sets they put on definitely make it worth a visit
the schnitzel  is unbelievable and on thursdays they have a beef rib special that will blow your mind
i also can say only good things about my chicken enchiladas as can my friend regarding her carne asada tacos
as it turned out this terrible company will not pay you your proceeds until up to 30 days after receiving them from the client thus defeating your purpose for hiring them in the first place
the ass juice is wayy better than it sounds
the only reason i would give them 4 stars instead of 5 is the smoking
very friendly and knowledgeable staff
they add cranberry jicama and i believe mango to your standard avocado blending
i finally made a long awaited return trip to zinburger and it was as good as i remembered it
they gave me plenty of information about the place and where everything was located
it wasnt until later he admitted his pizza was one of the best he had ever had like ever
they should be called not spicy potatoes
happy hour food is excellent
which i get there at 10ish  maybe at that time the servers are check out
if you are in the mood to just hang out with some friends and enjoy and nice casual place this is your digs
i sat another 1015 minutes after id finished my meal nursing my drink and only because i caught the servers eye was i given my cheque
the hostess are young students that will greet you kindly at the door
this was the highlight of my trip
downside  you are using a dress which requires the women to be constantly adjusting readjusting moving placing it to look at all decent and cover their assets enough they dont feel completely awkward which results in lower confidence and worse attitude by the women who are instantly defensive and can you blame them
i got an ice tea
okay food for the price during happy hour
ive always sat outside and since im from mn i consider this a distinct pleasure
been to several clubs in vegas and never been kicked out disrespected and treated like this
this place is absolutely the worst
but did seem a little bit on the cheaper side
i had read so many great reviews on yelp various blogs so i was excited to try their menu
it came way too spicy
the decor is like being in japan
based on the well design nice dt location and excitement people talked about the park my friendscoworker and i were really excited to try this restaurant
they create a vibe of family and friendliness to all patrons who enter their door
we asked for some sodas and both the coke and dr pepper were flat as if it was an old 2 liter bottle took our order and brought our food 30 minutes later we never got any side dishes like the other tables there the grill ended up going out half way through cooking the meat took them 10 more minutes to come to the table so we could tell them the food was not cooking
when she did bring out my food it was the correct dish but i thought there still had to be a mistake
we have been to sapporo a number of times
so this was a tough review to write
food is very good
my husband took me here for mothers day
place is a overpacked piece of shit
sundays are amazing for full day of football
they have a decent selection of wine beer tequila and mixed drinks
i even saw the chefowner
unfortunately both my husband and i thought the food was okay  not amazing
as far as food goes i had the boneless wings and a salad
we were a group of army soldiers having a reunion on short notice due to failing health of our friend of 37 years
about another 10  15 minutes passed before we got our nachos
the reason why i gave it one star and wish i couldve gave it negative stars was because of what they were serving behind the bar
nice atmosphere friendly service and tasty pizza
shrimp tempura udon was ok i wouldnt order it again though
super expert tip  all of my peking tokyo fortune cookies have come true
i recommend the following cheese curds a light snack to start off and they are amazing
really laid back atmosphere with good music on the first night saturday they had a dj took away a star as they abruptly closed both evenings by turning off the heat
sadly the beautiful view of the waterfall doesnt compensate for the lack of originality in sushi rolls mehness on the robatayaki and bad decor
you can tell a lot of thought goes into the performance
i started with the wedge salad while my friend had some kind of bibb lettuce rollup special and they were both good
the inside of this place is pretty cute and the staff are welcoming
dont bother filling you tummy with the rolls because that makes you full instantly because we ordered about 2 and yes they were good but they were so filling
the nachos are also a must try they are huuuuge
excellent burgers cooked to perfection  truffle fries wonderful winesthe milkshakes
the salmon is slightly sweet and crispy the greens fresh and lightly dressed
garlic fries werent anything too spectacular
i came here with 5 other friends around 630 on a saturday night and we were seated immediately in the corner of the restaurant
okay thats one
he finally asked how our meal was he was met with a not good he glossed right over what we said and asked if we wanted to box up our food
from the light fixtures the bar the wood walls love it all
im not a beer connoisseur but i do enjoy trying different types and was excited by all the variety here
their handmade veggie patty was great
the panther roll excelled at giving me that crunch i wanted
this made me think that the restaurant was masked as a decently priced asian restaurant to tourists that have probably never eaten good asian food  its panda express on a plate instead of styrofoam
this is definitely a place designed for local foodies with an advanced palate
the hotel is absolutely beautiful
not the place for kids on a friday or saturday per say but sunday was just right
little salty stew but this pasta was very thick so actually good valance
plus points  portions are good atmosphere was nice negative points  food was very mediocre prices are high for the quality of food with vegas having so many awesome restaurants i cant see myself spending my money here ever again
the people next to us liked the salmon so i guess i got the wrong thing
i didnt like it
im a fan but sometimes its just aok i enjoy the fact that its an easy walk down the draught path my name for the recently paved path leading to draught from wesley heights and its really the most accessible sports bar to get to on foot
next time you are downtown for a ball game or an event taking place or maybe even a stroll be sure you stop by squid ink
the wait staff took its time getting to us
no pizza boo
service was a little sluggish but overall decent
i was excited to see that they have boba but i didnt try it
although we waited a little long it was definitely worth it
it was a quick lunch but it was all good
also bring all the good karma you can find
i used to love coming here but ever since oyshi opened and its closer to my house too i frequent that place more often now
they brought out the funnel cake fries i believe
the service was good
we went for the sushi and ramen however the people next to us were having spaghetti and italian
i like creative cut rolls and that is the one thing i did not like here
staff laughed at what i said and poured away
love this place
but im really writing this to praise the food
if they did then they can get served right away
their carbonara udon is heaven on a plate
for dinner you are limited to one order of uni and sweet shrimp per person
the drink id like and she was right
they use almond to replace the seend which is very neat and the bacon wraped around the sweet dates
marcines is proof that appearances can be deceiving
it was really lame my friend and i had to make do with one broken bench and one wobbly table in the shady unsunny side of the patio
yes its packed yes you have to come at 3 if you want to be sitting on a chair by the time the show starts at 4 pm no it wont win any decor or mixologist awards but that is not the point  jazz here on saturday afternoons is hands down an experience that everyone should have at least once
le personnel est galement trs courtois et modifie le menu selon vous dsirs
thats not ok
i usually come here for happy hour
make sure if a female to bring a towel to sit onbecause it truly is orgasmic and you do not want to get your chair or floor wet
kinda doubting the claim they use mancinis buns
i hated the lighting in the room the only normal light was in the washroom minus toilet room
we went upstairs when our friends arrived
the prices are typical edinburgh city centre ie
location is good because its right on fremont but its tucked back in the neonopolis so you wouldnt find it unless you were looking
unless youre a beautiful young man dont expect any service or any orderly delivery of food and beer
we were actually seated faster than expected
the pork nachos were to die for and the fried pickles were delish
the eggs benedicts were one of the best ones ive tasted so far
there was a couple of places open next to the yucca a smoke shop that carried a small selection of cigars and lots of head shop stuff a pool hall of sorts and then the yucca itself
the slider buns were not fresh and either from early that day or the previous day
this hookah spot is amazing
wanted to try dessert but who charges 7 bucks for one cannoli
our waitress erika was just wonderful and made our experience just terrific
has a great neighborhood atmosphere  not a chain formula feel
i walked into zipps by accident
its very creamy or too creamy i couldnt finish it maybe other drinks might be better
sooooo disappointed in the pool
due to his consideration we will continue to
especially when it gets busier the bar gets really backed up and you really cannot easily get around with all the seating areas they have next to the bar
the aiolis for dipping are so good
the only thing i loved about this experience was our waitresss pink eye shadow
the card include their daily specials etc
fresh juice machine is a plus
really enjoyed the ambiancethe food was great we tried a bit of everythingi personally really liked the beef and short ribs
people were sure flowing in
the auld hoose also has a dartboard at the back of the pub
i hope to come back on a future trip to vegas
tuna was fresh and not overwhelmed with sauce
the miso was fresh and i could taste the bonito in it
i used to be able to stay at one of the casinos at fremont street for anywhere from 20 dollars to 50 dollars a night
i did have one issue i was given a warning for offending other patrons
i also had the mac n cheese along with the jallepeno corn
the prices are pretty reasonable and the decor is really great
mussels are great and a good place to share some appys and a drink
thanks jr and thank you omnia for an incredible evening
downgrading the rating one star
im sommer besonders gemtlich auf der terasse
corey was fantastic  and the food is great
hospitality at its best
i have eaten here three times
there is a bar in the back
the best item was the dessert butter cake and whip cream
the tandoori wings came out first since it is an appetizer
as is their bbq chicken sammy
flannerys is a great place to come before or after a cavsindians game although it usually gets pretty packed
my favorite element is the one way mirror behind the hostesses that you can see straight out of from the mens room so you can still see most of the tvs while at the urinals
im going to say that again
i was pretty worried that he wouldnt enjoy the meal but i think he loved it more than i did
what can you say after 186 reviews
the huge selection of tequila is almost enough by itself but the drinks and food are delicious
an efficient way to eat  meat cheese fries and slaw
i really liked first first is an american style and themed restaurant in the venetian
we have not been there during a dinner rush nor have we had their brunch yet
its really nice esp since there are no fridges or ice machines etc that you can just ask the bar for whatever you like
ok so on gabes recommendation i tried the blackened ahi tacos today they were freakin awesome
we were in phoenix for a vacation and had the concierge recommend it
the ravioli looked and tasted sublime with watermelon radish
the single taco for 6 is more than i would pay for a street style taco
interesting combination but it works well
bien laissezmoi vous dire  quel point ce ft une superbe ide de venir ici
i love sushi
while we were waiting for our table they were sitting at the bar doing shots which i did not think much of
right before i left i checked  on my phone  he charged the card that i didnt want him to charge
thanks for the lovely evening
they really are doing their best
but still its annoying  i feel like a walnut especially the generous amount and all crushed up that was there should not have been a menu oversight
the food menu was interesting in that all items on it were priced at 8 each  would make it really easy to split a check if there with a group
we finished off our meal with their churro dessert and i can say ive never had churros quite like theirs filled with deliciousness and chocolate sauce for dipping
saturday march 29 2014aina roots birthday bash with live performances by bengali x las vegas reggae allstars ftryan  iz frm haleamano x aina rootsno cover chargedoors 9pm21
i was there for business lunch and we were the only ones there
i think i ate like half of theirs
i always thought that food was prepared in kitchen not the bar
i will be back as soon as there is a special occasion justifying my return
we had 23 rounds of drinks and i told our group that this kind of place would only otherwise exist in nyc
lunch specials available if you opt out for ayce from 795  sushi special 895   when i found the bento box not sparkling clean i just feel uncomfortable here is one of the place i felt like that   i finished eating my sushi and maki roll but i just could not bring myself to eat the salad   fish quality is meh i found them not too fresh  i dont know if i would come back here for lunch anymore  the ambiance is quite japanese but with the waitress and the sushi chef talking to each other loudly in chinese did ruin the moment
having been a patron of this establishment for many a year now i really cant talk highly enough of itbut i shall give it a darn good go
i had heard good things about harrys and decided to give it a try
i wouldnt tell anyone to go out of their way to check it out but i myself would go back
selection would go a little further but if not a wine personyoull never know the difference
one car at the window and two in line
go for the ambiance and not the food
we ended up getting there before 6 for an awesome happy hour
the left was the main dinning area where we were seated
i mean a free drink would have been way better but its all cool
half off house sake and cheap pints of sapporo
i highly recommend it
for bubble tea you can choose ur teadrink type bobatoppings amount of sugar amount of ice
the place is tiny ran down and a little cramped with japanese decor
im not sure why this place got such horrible reviews
the salads are not very good and they are skimpy with the ingredients
we were there on mothers day for dinner and our server was friendly but a bit overwhelmed so it took a really long time for our apps and bread but we knew how busy she was so we just gabbed
then unfortunately heidi our waitress came over but the only way we knew her name was from the bill at the end
my 4 year old nephew is afraid to go to the movies because of this
the vegetarian tacos were pretty good as well
they charge 3game
there are no indications of anything regarding hours of operation or for that matter anything else save the pictures of semi attractive wannabe cowgirls on the window
this part of town has always seemed shady to me so to be honest i wasnt sure if i should go in
i also like it that they are open late
why yes he is because everything is good here
booths are nice japanese style
why would you expect a restaurant to split your large check when on the menu it clearly states that parties of six or more will not be split
the idea was cool but the movie room was small  and the seating area that more like a lounge area with pillows was super dirty and gross
as i am not a 19 year old girl there arent many reasons for me to spend extended  time at the marketplace
a new and appreciated detail is their drink menu featuring some unique cocktails
great service amazingly delicious wraps the butter chicken and naan were full of flavor and very deliciousfresh fair prices clean bathroom very friendly staff
what really surprised me was at the end there was no offer to cover dry cleaning and no comp of any items on the bill
so you can have as much yogurt and toppings you can fit in your cup
i am giving the potato salad its own line even though it was a side for the pulled chicken sandwich
hes the man

the fish was amazing
location is great for us as its on the way home and has lots of parking

i threw 5 on for tip

skinny fries small portions
the congee was very very good
have been here multiple times
then when the drinks finally arrived a few of them were wrong
the restaurant is huge but not overly noisy when busy and the design of the restaurant is very appealing giving you a hint of the islands
also great are fresh yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno new style sashimi and sashimi salad with matsuhisa dressing
best burger ive had in awhile
i have to admit i was a bit skeptical to see if we could pull everything off but adam came to the rescue and got us everywhere we needed to go on time plus added some extra stops
they also seemed confused why i needed the lobster safecracking equipment in the first place
puerto rico latin bar  grill pops up so i call and place a pick up order
i also appreciate the fact that everything is served in ceramicglass platesbowls i hate the cheap plastic plates
the bartender was pretty new she had said but she was very good at her job
we will definitely
she brought us each a little container of the sauce which made the tacos a lot better and surprise we got charged for each container
i like the strip at night but im not a pay 120000 for 2 bottles for bottle service kind of gal and this was great for 1 night of fun
it was delicious
they avoid eye contact with customers seems to be a way to not talk to customers
the food was very good and the customer service was on point
go to hugo cellars
i will never return to this place
i loved your work in blond ambition
the impossible burger is a vegan burger
beautiful restaurant with wonderful food
we all ordered the hh american burger and it came with your choice of side fries or chips if youd like a different side replacement onion rings sweet potato fries or tots and or side salad just an additional 2
ate here before the cactus bowl
fridays with a dj and dark lights i find the biggest fail for their known for chicken tenders which did nothing for me at all  the servers are all pretty hot though but youd never really know since you need a flashlight to read to menu
my husband loves the red rock roll
thank you eddie v we will certainly be back
is this kid serious
on monday or tuesday  they offer half price wings specials
especially since the food menu online displays farmtotable type of good food
i moved from california to northern alabama and i miss good sushi
last weekend my sister mom and some friends stopped by for late night drinks and snacks
7  i agree with one of the other reviews i came across this place is a dump
they will not clear your plates until they are absolutely sure you are finished or give them a signal napkin on plate or even a nod
after i refused repeatedly the terrible wannabe dj called out over the microphone come on blondie get up there
our waitress was very friendly and attentive
we came in with our two girls in the burley stroller and they made every accommodation for us
weve each tried a different drink every time we go and have never been disappointed
the drinks are bomb and the customer service was beyond excellent
i have decided i need to go back for both the breakfast and dinner buffets to find out which one is the ultimate best
the green chilis on my sandwich were my favorite part
tyra in particular
sashimi came in large juicy and fresh pieces i was definitely satisfied
wanted to tell the trainee to run away as fast as possible but she looked like a deer in headlights
we got the apple crostata for dessert which was also very good
delux burger classic burger fish sandwichalways superb
amazing location so close to gcc and asu west
i wanted more
that goes for the sushi chefs and the owner himself
i dont mind paying a lot for good mexican food but this wasnt very good
15 minutes go by
i hate to tell you but that is more common than you think
unfortunately the fish was left in the fryer too long
i go for the veggie chicken wings and the thaistyle pizza
they have a very wide selection and if youre a beer nerd you should really consider joining their ufo club and becoming a beer knurd
i ordered a hollywood chicken sandwich and my dad got wings
after we sat on the outside patio a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled
i am a size 0 120 lbs i do not eat a lot by any means
this is a great bar
i was a little sad that my taco shells fell apart and they became pretty messy
i love their rolls their sashimi are so fresh and delicious
this is definitely a place to peoplewatch as the patronage is so diversified one has to wonder what sway crystal corner has over madisonites
i will be back next time we are in mississauga
too bad it was a good night till the steak and lack of customer service ruined it
the smoothie was solid
trs bon repas de moules frites et assortiment de bires impressionnant
he did bring more bread after we asked numerous times only to drop the empty basket in my lap
pretty sure i wont be back
live it up you are in las vegas for cryin out loud
i will go back to the village tavern and eat this again
highly salty and very average
at first we though it would be chewy but it surprisingly was not at all
we were the third party in line and waited approximately 45 minutes
outstanding cilantro lime shrimp taco del mar fish taco was excellent and came as ada taco was very good
i ordered the five course set meal and i must say there wasnt a dish that i did not like
my one problem was the close quarters with other diners
will not be back
its healthier cuisine that is amazing
they offer a wide variety of japanese dishes
but the mac and cheese grandmas and the green chili  we tried both were unparalleled
i love the atmosphere and the bar theme
a great way to showcase the dining room but still let us see the casino
the only things harris has going for it right now are its patios cleverly written menu and nice location on ellsworth ave oh and a lot of condescending dbags if youre into that kinda thing
my boyfriend and i went here for valentines day  had a great meal
valet is pretty much the only way here
lots of beer choices to choose from too
now as far as the service goes its great for where your at its basically theatre with food and drinks
mediocre at best
i watched uefa baseball hockey and tennis  love it
arisu is a great choice if you dont have any specific cravings in mind like soon tofu or fried chicken and want to have the benefit of a large menu to choose from
also really good food
im going to have to try their pancakes next time
we eat here fairly often as the food is exceptional
stopped in for a family dinner and to try out a new vietnamese eatery in the neighbourhood and sorry to say it was a tad underwhelming
but this place takes the cake
so far i have not tried the sweet waffles but on the savory waffle front im in love with the waffidilla add the avocado and the west coast
our ball basket was always fully stocked and it was a great way to spend some time among friends
it looked like they had a pretty good selection of beverages however i did not try any this time
met some friends there on a sunday during football playoff season
however the leftovers are still sitting in the fridge for his dish and its now thursday
and the bartender was in and out of the back i only got two drinks after playing 30  they do have a few pool table and nice size bar and a really nice seating area for watching the big screens
i have heard about this savoy place from different people so i thought id give it a try when i came in town
a huge plus is that they allow dogs on their patio which is fully covered and they also have misters that periodically come on to cool you down
cant wait to eat here again
ok fine comply with it
on sunday i met up with some friends to have lunch there at around 300 others in our party ordered burgers and really seemed to enjoy them
came here for a quick birthday dinner before we went out for the night
overall prosperity is a great place to hang if youre in the tremont neighborhood
if you feel like having a few margaritas and watch a some foot traffic of lasvegas  cabo wabo deck is your spot
with so many people lolas quite noisy for a restaurant that isnt a sportsbar  which makes it a bit tougher to have a conversation than youd like
she was giving us blunt answers
our server also lacked any manners or knowledge of how to serve food or clear plates
careful when using the bathroom as there is no real distinction for men vs women
all in house and not piss in a can like bud light
this was my first time at this place
the bill for all that food a ketel one martini and a generous glass of frogs leap wine came out to just under 200
the food was incredible great service and good portions
it was too bad that they were a little chewy
the view of the pool from the room would of been nice if the window was clean
being the only guy in the group i didnt mind being asked my order last
great escape lounge the
i ordered the wine pairing with the meal which i highly recommend
love the service
companion and i arrived at 530 with reservations and were immediately seated
restaurant cover band rocked it friendly helpful bell desk guy
well be backand the chairs are really nice and comfy
same fish  okay quality
it is next door to cowboy ciao and is the perfect place for a late night date or just a good time
i had plenty of time to relax even if service was slow
saturday is when most of the attractive men have gone to bs west charlies or are busy elsewhere
mushy lackluster ingredients and disappointing portion size
the one at the linq is the best
i would give them a 35 if i could
i saw a lot of poor reviews and a poor approval rating on urban spoon as well but my wife and i were pleasantly surprised
the patrons were drunk and rowdy in my opinion quite rude and they were getting a kick out of hitting people with beach balls not me so im not just writing that because i was upset by being hit  i wasnt and splashing girls in the face when they were all made up with hair and makeup
i will probably crave that filet in the very near future
despite a dining room that was perhaps halffull when we were seated the amount of time we waited to give our order as well as the time between courses seemed almost geologic
my husband was delighted with the gluten free menu
if that makes sense
everything was fresh and delicious
it was disgusting
do they earn stars for being divier
was it worth the extra 32
talk about unbeatable peoplewatching
we went on a fairly busy sunday afternoon and the staff was not up to the challenge
as these are basically two of my favorite food concepts i was sold
upon walking to the bathroom a member of our group noticed some love looking sausage rolls that the kitchen was preparing but we couldnt find them on the menu
pros fantastic ambiance great assortment of drinkscocktails
i like my wings with the bone otherwise known as tradition wings
upscale gay bar
no more makinotodai crap for me
the whole office loved their food and we will definitely be ordering there again
and why are the drinks so overpriced
if youre looking for a piece of old vegas this is your place
das festival ist umsonst
if you find yourself in central phoenix in need of a meal this is a great option
im not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there
we may have just been feeling the impact of a new wait staff or an inexperienced waitress im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt
whenever i visit the lake norman area i always try to make it over to 131 main
place was a joke
i order from here almost 3 times a week for lunch
the real disappoint came on the duck breast
not being a huge fan of irish food or beer for that matter i decided this would be the 1 in 100 dining experiences i let him choose
i ended my lunch with the fountain of youth smoothie with spinach added at the recommendation of the lovely girl that works here and was really impressed
at the end of the day its hard to beat 1 well drinks  but when visiting vegas i wont be back for anything else
sea scallops paired lovely with my favorite wine kim crawford
next time im going to chase my potato chips with a 190 octane now thats a snack
the service was excellent
for my meal i ordered the emmitt smith which was a bacon cheeseburger with chili
vegan wise i dont see much offered on the menu so when i come to pkwy its strictly to drink
i had a bite of my friends cheese burger and it was great but of course not as adventurous as mine haha
i think the place needs some tlc maybe some new booths
a full service restaurant the prices are very fair  the food very good
sushi is very flavorful and different
the servers do an excellent job of getting to know their customers especially january  who really likes coffee by the way
love this place
the pierogis were a beautiful elevation of a cleveland classic very rich and filling
butcher sheet table coverings writing all over the walls by guests very casual attire w plastic bibs provided
i wanted to poke one of them to see if i would hit metal
dinner is the best deal
one of the best in arizona
great atmosphere  service
ive enjoyed several micro brewery beers there  perhaps they might be more standard in montreal but not so much elsewhere in toronto so its a nice treat
the waiter did some research on our friend and creepily told her where she was from who she worked for and what she did for a living
my entree of nc trout was very bland as well as the days special grouper
thats all you need
the patio is great and im obsessed with the exploding potatoes
i dont know if the air conditioning was broken but just a room fan would have helped a lot
i get the carne asada burrito with green extra spicy enchilada sauce
there is a donut station where on of the chefs hand dips the donuts in various sauces
our waitress brought back our iced tea we places our ordered and then sipped our iced that turned out to be super tastey and was garnished with an orange
if not just know that there are plenty more out there
surtout lorsque cest possible
dont even get me started on a mexican restaurant running out of pacifico
we were greeted at the counter by a very nice young man
service was extremely slow
shed really be better off having daddy pay for her sorority dues than trying to work as a server
the sauce on top did it for me
please please do not eat here a friend and i went here saturday night and had the all you can eat sushi the sushi looks good on the plate and in pictures but once you put it in your mouth it is mussy and warm
i freely admit as a disclaimer the new mexico style mexican food is a second compared to southern az style in my personal favorite
if youre going to charge 6 for a beer can you please plow some of those proceeds into staff training andor accountability
a hidden gem in the heart of a neighborhood that prides itself on hidden gems
ive also been into many casinos in vegas and this one is very nice in looks but considering you can still smoke in casinos in my opinion ban it if you want to keep it classy you have to have the right ventilation system
i ordered a rum  coke this last time and they brought me a highball glass just about full of rum with a small bottle of coke next to it
new york style thincrust
the women are very hot too
i dont eat eggs and most of the breakfast meals come with eggs
weve only been there twice each time we were a party of four so we tried several different dishes
overall great service food and we will definitely be back
the batter at malees is very light and crispy
i can tell you that this is not your typical sharpsburg bar
there is a jukebox but it is rarely turned on
warning  most scottish cuisine should be eaten with a group of friends preferably trained in cpr as undoubtedly someone will need resuscitated
we spent about 40 per person including beer and cocktails which i felt was an excellent value
dont fall for this tourist trap
the banh mi burger yes this was some good stuff
and the place was a bit a mess i guess this is a great place if your a scottsdale deuschbag
at first i thought i could call this place my new favorite restaurant
best service in town
good menu with a solid variety very good drink offerings
try the fried avocado
overall it was a nice place and i look forward to coming back
baffled in ballantyne
this restaurant is top notch
there was nothing truly exciting about his lack lustre performance
i would much rather wait for a table than have to pack in for standing room only
if you have to go here i would get a table away from the main dance floor where people wont be bumping into your bottle of vodka
this drink is more beautiful than delicious if that is possible
my chef salad was packed with turkey bacon and lots of veggies
its decor has a subtle miami vice look and feel
this place is great over all the music that they play on mondays is great and i always go on a monday because its not as busy so u get extra attention from the chefs jasonryan and geo the server
not the best i tasted but surely works if you crave for sushi and thats the only place nearby you can go to kill the sushi craving
felt like they were made from a neighbors backyard
pork belly was also insanely good
on their cooked food menu the soft shell crab is great
honestly every chance i get to have lunch with a friend or a coworker i instantly recommend we eat at kyara and why not
i am very happy to report that this place is even better now after its renovation inside and out complete with an addition of a barlounge on the 2nd fl terrace accessible by stairs and elevator
the interior is a safari motif with huge palm fans and larger than life animal structures
my mom does  shes from the philippines and hasnt been here since 1975  im bringing her when she comes next june for my wedding
we gave him our complimentary drink tickets and with a full bar they came our rather quickly
dont get me wrong i still think this place was a winner but i just scraped off the saltseasonings and went on to the next item
we came in for an afternoon lunch on the patio
bartender had a hard time making a martini
response we do not have lids so you will have to take the coffee without a lid
i am a fan of the keg
i had a thin crust pizza which wasnt crispy enough for my taste
what a mistake that was
the selection of sashimi is also limited but like ive said theyre a great sushi place and i will always see myself coming back
started out nice
i went with my family and we ordered all veggie items
food was okay but service was slow and uncaring
the rabbie burns is a very reputable cafe on the royal mile serving up a number of snacks ranging from paninis and breakfasts to burgers
if it were closer it would have potential to rival sycamore brewing in atmosphere and great selection of drinks
servers are friendly
if you been to kabuto before then you will know what i mean
been coming here for heres and to the chinese village since i was about four years old
dont get me wrong
it was made to perfection for us
the food better be amazing and it was not
but zeffirino deserves your attention for sheer ambience deliciousness and overall experience
loud and lots of drunk people but the amazing wings totally make up for it
will definatly be back
i am a regular best tasting beer and bar food in town
always come with friends for their great happy hour
the lady at the counter prepared the food pretty fast
just not keeping pace with the other uptown eateries
big group of us went for food and cocktails
all in all it was fun as hell
i thought i came to vegas to get away from clubs like this
second time there my only beef is that its too crowded every time i go
you know how i adore my mastros city hall mac n cheese
this is the main club area
we were excited about a brewery opening down the street from our home but our visit tonight was close to terrible
they both loved the taco guild version of sangria which i wasnt a fan of but i didnt realize it was supposed to be a version of sangria since there really isnt any wine in it
i may have scarred my dinner partner for life in doing so though
as a side we tried the often mentioned green chili mac and cheese
from my very visit to now theyve always been consistent with drinks and theyve always been super quick
theres no ott presentation here  just perfect crockery and relaxed plating
this is the spot where all my friends and i go when we hit mill
will not come back for a while maybe never
disgustingly overprice for less than average sushi
i guess we were glad we chose to go for this instead of the 45 for 2ppl because even by selecting 5 plates we still left hungry
we go back very frequently for my absolute favorite sushi ever the philly crunch roll a tempura fried philly roll with an amazing sauce
mine was melt in my mouth tender and so flavorful
the truffle macncheesedevine
my wife had mahi tuna that was inedible
we were so excited to be back after not having been in a couple years
isnt the point of a sports bar to watch multiple games
great service food family friendly
they also have a build your own milkshake as well as a hot smore bar
there are three sticks instead of one large one
i was doing some shopping at the mall for running shoes and it was lunch time so i headed over to brio for their chopped salad and a beer
larger seating area than before
der betrunkene hrte nicht aufsondern noss und spukte auf die tische
ordered a pikachu drink with boba and lemon grass chicken bowl for my boyfriend and i to share
only two downfall was it was hot inside
place is really smoky even if youre in the non smoking area
i mean really a sports bar where you cant get a burger and fries
there are a ton of wing options literally at least a hundred different flavors
called the restaurant as we were running late for 10 mins due to unexpected delays at the subway
i love the environment and their food especially on mondays and wednesdays when they have half proce chicken wings
during the winter months the bar area opens onto a small patio
that bowl of glorious heavenly mixture of cheeses and meats was on point aka it was delicious
while this place gets a lot of raves for the beer selection they have an impressive bourbon list
presentation was fantastic service was great and we all were pleased with our cocktail choices
great place to watch the game
the food is great the restaurant is smokin cool and they have a great happy hour
fantastic rolls the combination of pepper and sweetener is brilliant
you get the idea
we ordered a lot of the recommended items yelpers suggested
we figured that it would taste better since there were less people to cater to
staff is gross as well and owner was drunk at bar
the portion was pretty big compared to other sushi restaurants
the wine was over priced for what it was greater than 15 a glass
absolutely love this place
everything was working correctly and the food service and atmosphere were nice
service was fast and friendly already planning a return
best vegas experience ever
avoid this place and the idiot bartenders at all costs or spend hours away from your group trying to get drinks
im sure ill be back at some point but i might try out a few other places first
risotto seafood was excellent
its great to just sit back relax and have a nice afternoon lunch or casual dinner
nice atmosphere with tv screens at the booth
puff daddy crowd control is non existent
bad form dude
play cards and pool
never againgo to steak and shake   better burgers and you will have 80 bucks in your pocket
i was already dressed and ready to go  just needed to throw my jacket into a locker
im sorry he wasted the extra 5 seconds of his life and that it was such a taxing experience to provide an explanation
there is also an outside patio with numerous tables and lighting
wow great fresh sushi and wonderful service
me and my friends came in for the raiders game tonight and i have some mixed feelings about the place
walking in youll notice the banners advertising the 6 appetizers all day in the bar area
and where else on the strip can you get a full meal for 25 that includes all the wine you can drink
a friend invited me out for some pool after a comedy show and this is their goto spot
i love wings
today i ordered for pick up and had my husband pick it up
it comes with three pieces of garlic bread with one holding white beans one with prosciutto and one with tomatoes olive oil and balsamic vinegar
im sure i misspelled that last one
there are bargains in vegas
i would definitely come back
highly recommend you try this if you havent before
the only issue what that they ran out of bud light bottles on a saturday afternoon
i overheard dozens of people over my shoulder complaining they waited 30 minutes for a beer
as someone who knows her beer and whiskey it can be incredibly frustrating having a male bartender treat me like a bud light girl haha
long version this is a letter sent to the managing partner  easiest to cc here and will update as applicable
our daughter got the waffle fries and chicken tenders she really liked the waffle fries
if you want to survive with all of your nearby competition you are going to have to step up your game
we tried several good desserts and the chocolate mouse cake was the favorite
also amazing but i could only eat about a third of it
i will never order delivery from here again
plus our tp girl is awesome
my friend got the cod which was delicious another friend had the steak which looked great in terms of steak and i had the rabbit pasta dish
despite this perceived flaw in service everyone was attentive friendly and quick maybe too quick
ingredients are always fresh and i like that there are a lot of options from the protein in the pita to the type whole wheat vs white toppings sauces and cheese
the portions are big and the prices are fair
the service is great and the food is so on point
oh and room service came really fast
i think they have a nice selection of entrees and those are well done in general however i would avoid the pizzas they are too greasy for me
the wait was reasonable
came with a large party and several orders were not prepared correctly
the salmon nigiri was delicious and so was the big salmon roll sinner smoked salmon for regular
but what differentiates lily fruit market from the rest are two things 1 they only sell fruits and fruit juices freshly squeezed or canned no other groceries 2 they sell tropical fruitslots of them
the chef here are creative and they consistently create rolls that incorporate the east and west ingredients to provide customers with one of a kind experience
omg oh my gravy
however when i asked where my beer was 15 mins after ordering it all others had been delivered and when we told her we wanted to wait to order dinner until our last party member showed up apparently that was rude
would i go back no i left with a head ack
the night included a 3 course dinner champagne toast and some great noise makers and party hats
sho y after lunch to grab a drink
loved all 3 fun country bar
it was a little busy so it did take little to get our food
this place is the shiznits
tonight we came as a party of four
my son really enjoyed his experience and said mom when new movies come out can we come here to see them
drive thrus are my thing and only had one car in front of me
not worth a visit anymore
whenever we had a question about the menu or what was good our server always has an answer
i almost gave it 1 star
she was friendly and chatty
they need to have website with the menu on it so you can call in your pickup order
great service and wings
two for tuesdays  go to lunch and you get burgers for  half off
in particular order the bourbon smash and bramble
id skip the casey roll tookinda funny that the two most expensive ones were all of our least favorites
after doing a round of celebratory engagement drinks here we were quite full on the stuffed dates my absolute favorite filet mignon sliders mac n cheese can hardly ever go wrong with these terra y mare skewers and camarones a la diabla
french onion soup i didnt pick this one but we both thought this was a bit too salty duncan houses french onion soup blew this one out of the waters and i honestly couldnt have any more after two spoonfuls
this is sort of a cluster of a story to tell as a review and maybe not a reason for a single star but its not how things happen but how you deal with them ill write
the spicy tuna roll was great
i drove all the way here to get an acai bowl and it wasnt even closing time
maybe most people wouldnt agree but i mean you get what you pay for
i cant say that food was very tasty but it was not bad
go here
the bartender seemed bothered that we stopped in to ask if they were participating in the scavenger hunt and when we sat down to actually give her some business she seemed more interested in the guys in the band setting up their equipment
maybe if the service and her attitude didnt suck i would have
this is only my second time eating there i am certain to go back
the waitress was kind of clueless
when it is open 247
thanks for the best night guys
nice place to relax
the wine is great the meat and cheese platter is fantastic everything else on their menu is made from salt seasoned with salt served on a bed of salt and topped with a side of salt
nice outdoor seating as well
food is served fresh individually as you order
i have never had this before so i wouldnt know what to compare it to though
they have a tempting pierogie of the day dish  dont fall for it it is disgusting 99 of the time
i pointed out that i received 5 pieces tonight and was told that the order i received was wrong
makes it even better
they do ayce where you actually just order whatever you want off the regular menu and they make and deliver it to you
everything was very delicious
if you park in the neonopolis garage be sure to get your parking ticket validated before you leave so parking will be free
the food quality and selection was below average
youll understand once youve seen the menu but dont be put off by the names it makes ordering so much fun
all had fun and several have gone back as a result of their initial experience
the wines are all south american and we did a tasting of 3 chards which were all inexpensive and surprisingly good
after choosing the cozy left side of the lounge we trolled the bar area of course where we met stephen
i bet the cheese starts melting rather fast
as for the decor it is a nice mix of modern with hints of rustic
the decor was very modern and romantic
they have these very complicated diagrams everywhere showing you where you can and cannot park
really enjoyed eating here its proper eat eat eat all you can then get out of here so others can eat eat eat all they can as well p not a place for first dates obviously so dont expect class
great food and a quaint feel to the place
our drink decisions were expressed and we sat back to browse the menu and chitchat
best sushi burrito i have tasted
topped with a caramelized sugar crust
i stopped at tres pesos on my way home from work one night to get a delicious addition to dinner of chips cheese dip and salsa
havent eaten at a maggianos in a long time and never before at this particular location but i really could not ask for anything better
ps the busser even tried to start a fight
and no the two warm sakes i drank did nothing to influence my review
very kind and considerate service
i will definitely eat here every time i am in phoenix
i came here with a large group of my employees and we had an outstanding time
where was the boudin
yahh dont go there
there was a rotten piece of cabbage in my coleslaw i just picked it out the rest of t was fine
no one came after a minute or 2 so we left
i had the great lakes and the rogue dead guys ale
i have never had a bad meal at boos
it is awesome with different kinds of bread with two types of spread one salmon based and the other bean if i recall
rein geschmacklich sind diese aber durchaus mal ein probieren wert
the burger came back after a half asked refiring on the same lettuce and bun
perhaps i was not in the right state of mind because i had a better time wandering the casino alone checking out the sights and gambling a bit while my friends stayed behind
my boyfriend actually ended up with a turkey burger and we arent sure if it was maybe the way he ordered it that threw them off or if they just brought him the wrong meal
definitely not he case i didnt care for the sauce and wouldve preferred a quail egg though
i find every excuse possible to go here and eat oodles of noodles
the three pastas were very very basic
the bartender was quick and nice and after putting in the order of 10 wings it went downhill
you really need to make it a point to check this place out if you havent already
purchased a cabana for the day
however since they are relatively new they are not yet a wellgreased running machine
that said i went with a dark porter based on the recommendation of the bartender
they were lightly breaded and fresh
my sons lemonade was 359
the staff was amazing and the food was even more amazing
we were sat immediately and started with their complimentary chips and red salsa
i went with a friend recently and had no expectations one way or the other upon arrival
stopped by ryoji for a bite with the girlfriend on a chilly friday night
it was my first time playing nolimit at a casino
the food was amazing
neither was good
the breakfast burrito goes well with a hangover
next time i come back i wont get this again
we sat there for no kidding 5 minutes waiting for our server to come over
the best way to sum up this place is they mean well but they are a little disorganized
every time i am in vegas i come here to eat
from the cool vibe to the witty extensive menu to the plethora of creative strong drinks its a winner
overall though this place is still really bomb
the vibe is 4 stars but the fact the bartenders know how to make a quality drink makes it 5 stars
the only thing huge was the super thick bun which was a little dry and stale
and aside from some of the basic preopening challenges that any new restaurant faces the ambiance service and food were all good
youll find a main room and another that accompanies the bar
ive had my share of frozen yogurt from places like golden spoon
hey youre in the venetian
that seems ridiculous to me
we also had yellowtail shashimi with jalapenos which was very good as well
and he also gave my little brother 6 a chopsticks helper thingy
the food itself is solid
this was also bullsht because my friend ordered more indeed
i started out with the grodz and followed up with velouria which was pleasantly pungent peach wheat beer
when we got here my husband spotted the bottle of alcohol on top of the bar
friendly servers with excellent service
i really really like this place
fresh meat  good preparation
from the beginning with the impeccable service to the amazing food this is not only one of the best dinners we have had in vegas this is one of the best meals we have had ever
this is the perfect place to unwind andor enjoy a sobering brunch
predominant wine regions are californian french and italian
thank you guys for going above and beyond when we didnt even ask for it
i certainly wont be back
this is my favorite place to go for ayce sushi
what a little gem
if i didnt already have the investment in boulders it would honestly make me think twice about going there
that necessary a lovely duck confit and bread salad steamship of pork an absurd cakey cut of grits amazingly rich and a delicious meringue dessert with maple ice cream all paired with wisconsin craft beers
i just found it super fast and very messy
both for me and my husbond and out 17th month daughter
they made us laugh they made us sing along and generally just made the place a good spot to choose for our sunday night
its a real treat
the menu is extensive huge variety of choices although there wasnt much that jumped out at me and sounded delicious
we would have had a nicer fresher meal at mc donalds for half the price
im guessing they could have had it corrected reprinted redacted  and just honored the price
yes she told us this is better
i also figured it might be a good place for a beer
ended up taking half to go and it held up nicely as a midnight snack
we didnt even mention the salad until the end of the meal when things had just become too much
the escargot were perfectly prepared
great drink selection and not overly expensive for scottsdale
i walked in and immediately grabbed a seat at the bar and studied their cocktail list
i mean a nice bottle of red wine from south australia
once he told me that he thought that this was better than the place that we normally endulge the hubby and i knew that we had to check it out
it was an older crowd than the college like scene at brutopia next door
i figured i was in a place that prides themselves on steaks and decided to give their cheap steak a shot
just a fun little bar for  great tropical drinks
2 if you insist i guess ill come along
the police should have been contacted to keep this guy off the street
lastly the atmosphere is casual laidback and very very friendly
happy hour is full of values
i thought they were fabulous
my only issue the strange beer special they had going
we ordered a bunch of tapasapps and drinks and our total for 3 people was 90  insane
there was no disappointment whatsoever
this place is a foodies dream
overall i enjoyed my visit to brand and id recommend trying it out
my buddy got an order of the smoked wings and they were outstanding
look no more i found my mammas cooking and here in midtown
they said itd be about 30 mins for a table and it was actually about 15 mins so that was a nice bonus
we were seated and then given a ticket receipt to show our server and then in turn order from their prix fixe menu
so much so that our waitress replaced the mocha martini that was cleared early by a busser
you have to cut it up and make it yourself
i never have any issue with service or food at this location
their food is really delicious and i really enjoy their customer service
i can forgive mediocre food if the service is excellent but after so many chances the only consistency ive found here is frustration
unfortunately we walked in off the streetodds are if youre reading this and on the internet in general you wont make our mistake
it is a bit hidden and easy to miss  just look for kenji sushi and then look down  the drinks here are top notch and the bartenders are incredibly knowledgable and friendly
my order was taken as soon as i entered the store and i was in and out within less than five minutes which is awesome because i usually wait around 15 to 20 minutes at the stc location
we were greeted very warmly by the staff especially the bartender and server that were objects of my alleged  harassment by the bar manager
the prices were pretty average for what i would expect to pay at a steakhouse
and not to mention the service is always on point
from there everything else was good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as i hoped still good
they have tons of tvs on the wall
no words do it justice
the food is fantastic the environment is fun and the staff is second to none
i feel more welcome here at palominos even though its a smaller place
the spicy tuna roll was nothing special
when we got inside we then came to discover that they had given away one of our reserved tables to another guest
i came here for a birthday drink and snack small order of sushi and dessert after having a meal elsewhere and it didnt wow me by any means
on monday nights at 1030 they have live music here
eventhough there was a mixup the staff still acted professional and tried their best to make the event run smoothly
couldnt tell if i was drooling or if it was the salad oil dripping but overall good
i think it starts the week off right
2 tapas for myself were more than enough it left me full
our food arrived and i must say we were both really happy
granted they were busy but that is no excuse ive been a bartender for 13 years and even when im in the weeds i make it a point to check on everyone at least once
the sports book like ambience was awesome
they have a cozy back patio
im staying at bellagio and dont want to go far just pay the cover to buy crappy drinks for an hour or so  thats it and cant even do that
i am guessing that the crme de cassis just overpowered everything else
we had the chinese chicken salad brussel sprouts chicken wings and the chopped veg salad
plus they were having 99 margaritas
my friends that were all at least five years younger than me felt old there
wish the happy hour lasted until 7 as showing up at 6 and missing out on the deals was a little frustrating
he gave us amazing recommendations and even brought out the most beautiful dessert for my best friends birthday that we were celebrating
youll get a bit of everything
on top of the taiyaki there was vanilla ice cream with raspberry syrup which was a great balance since the taiyaki was pretty hot inside
for lunch me and a friend ordered the chicken and waffles hugee dish btw and another friend ordered the cheeseburger
the place was still sorta busy but we didnt have to wait
we had an amazing weekend at the hard rock for march madness
turns out its written in small words at the very top of the doors
came on a saturday for lunch
everything tasted fresh
it comes with two side dishes  including butter corn on a hot plate too love this
what a fun place
staff is friendly place is clean and service is fast
what was there was good
service could be better mainly faster
have ordered takeout delivery and dined in and all were fantastic
so we tipped our server like 40 for stopping by to say hi seems like a great gig for her not so much for the customer
in the end wed prefer burgers cooked to order but were not terribly picky
drinks 1 gekkeikan traditional  warm sake in a small carafe probably 4 servings
how is this place still in business
they are better than 5 star in my book
also yummy is the raspberry bellini should you not be in the mood for vodka
soon a manager
one thing i hated was that many of the tables have backless bar seats
like microwaved bar food
i was angry at the latecomer who initiated escalated and poorly managed a situation which fked everyone elses evening
but it was good
our waitress is horrible
the entrance background is covered in shiny glass tiles
the rub our waiter was horrid
being an asian person and living in los angeles i have to say this is not as good as sushi in nyc or la
server was pleasant and got our orders in quickly
went her after a diamondbacks game
the minni bean burgers rock
hands down best taco shop in phx
ill need to save room when we go next
decided to give this place a try and ordered a large pizza to go
so i was there as it changes over to a clubby lounge atmosphere also
the ambience was quite nice
i love this place
a small lot up front but after 5 there is parking around the siderear just obey the signs posted as one business doesnt let you park at anytime for anyone but them
i absolutely love this restaurant and have no complaints except them adding on the gratuity for my family of 6
overall super happy i found this place
now that thats all out will i return a little visit
i had no idea this place existed
the seafood paella was horrible the rice was hard not aldente but hard
the sashimi deluxe was even better
i did look up at the bar and he was scanning the room noticed i was looking up his way to get his attention and he ran right over to see what we needed
stopped by for the first time this week and i really liked the place the look of it
the chefs are right up by the entrance and they always say goodbye a great bunch of people
a group of 5 of us ladies came for boozy brunch to celebrate a bachelorette and had a great experience
we paid the 60 per person for a table and then had all you can drink bud light
10 minutes later the phone is still ringing and nobody has picked up as i type this
the bartender asked about the full glass and i said i didnt like it to which she said ok and left
im sure do to time meat is sliced hours ahead
the bar area looks like it has locals that hang out on weekends
the food is delicious and the servers are great
the place was trendy looking the tapas was pretty good
even though it took a little longer than expected to come out of the kitchen id say it was worth the wait
worst service ever
i can tell the tap lines have not been cleaned in a very very long time
the peppery delicately dressed frisee accompanied by tiny bits of lobster were a facile blend of textures and tastes crisp tender peppery creamy
got a loaf of bread to take home the car smelled wonderful all the way home
41907 hands down the best tapas and sangria place ive ever been to
i freaking love sushi
ive had it in my pocket in my hand and on the table
this is spanish not mexican like some others have mistakenly mentioned
even without doing the special the draft beers are only 2
he is also a local and the time was at 1050pm
this would be the equivalent of bearded men wearing plaid talking about who brews their craft beer what type of hops it has and beating their chest about who has the best brewery setup in their closet at home
i had the bolognaise
covers range from free to 15 dollars which is expensive for madison depsite the occasional high cover this place has decent priced drinks and normally have drink specials
in addition to that did not ask for orders until another 30 minutes later
also their free appetizer coupons are a joke
bartender is perfectly friendly
although olivia seemed to must hate her job
as you can see prices are pretty good here and with so many of the dishes being offered as tapas style shares this is a pretty cool date spot imo
i would give 0 stars if yelp wouldnt let me
the outdoor patio is a favorite of mine
i ordered waffles expecting lovely fresh lyonnaise waffles  not liege waffles out of a packet
both were delicious
the server wasnt the most attentive as a few times we flagged them down  for drink refills and once looked around going where the fuck is she
the waitress told us about a special clam appetizer so we ordered that as well
the song selection wasnt the greatest ive definitely seen better
really i think i might have came here at the wrong time and probably should try it here for dinner and eat some other dishes because giving a review based on appetizers doesnt really feel like i know what im talking about but also if i was at a table i would probably be more inclined to order more food because when you sit at a bar you dont have alot of space
the appetizer platter is a meal in and of itself
the beer was good and cold we both ordered the large mug i think it was a liter
great outside patio terrific service outstanding food
would go again and plan for a 15 minute walk from the cesar lobby to restaurant
bacon and broccoli pasta it was good
but as of now i dont recommend this restaurant for dinner
aside from the great food the staff is so friendly and always smiling
i came here at least a good 5 times since opening to now mind you i live in markham so its a decent drive to go all the way to brampton to eat here
the food is very good great fish and chips wings and the comfort food is amazing
the inside of the restaurant is almost all wood and has a rustic feel to it
perfect premovie or date spot
service sympathique trs bonne exprience pour le brunch
this offthe strip burger joint is a hidden gem for those visiting vegas
not going back
took too long to get the menu the drinks and then the bill
i may just need to come back and try the place again
i got the pb bowl and it was awesome
ivehad lunch and dinner at tomo sushi
it was drinkable though
there is also a patio on the side of the restaurant
we had a couple of sodas 289ea and a black diamond craft 10oz 550hh
the interior is modern bright and new
i wish there was a steak n shake in california
i was not hungry so i didnt order anything besides a beer
went for early mothers day dinner and had a large group
this wasnt it
awesome bar it is basically an adults playground
the one glass of tea i recieved was good though
our server was attentive knowledgable and not at all irritated that we really were just there for a drink and some snacks
problem is it was bland
still though it wasnt bad
beyond the cool interior kellys has good food cheap happy hours and hasnt changed a bit
half off several menu items including filet mignon dinners
we did it up vip style for a bachlorette
the guacamole was exceedingly fresh
unique and delicious
love the big roll volcano fried shrimp roll even the sushi roll with beef
when i came in with my brother and friend they staff thought we played professional football
a little tough but for the price i was okay with it
we had fun
theres a lot going on with the burger
he walked away pissed
service is very friendly and efficient
i ordered the summer risotto  what a mistake
from knowing our names on the reservation to the valet service to our splendid server jeffrey hope i spelled it correctly to the ambience to the food amazing
service was above average mind you we were the 12 dozen patrons after a long weekend having lunch
stop in for awhile
that was more than enough food and good bang for your buck at 15
i had the shrimp fajitas
you get two sides we elected to have a salad for a100 up charge
service is never above mediocre
nothing to it
fun place to go watch a game the staff is always nice   and chuck e baby plays on friday night for dancing
flavorful and delicious food
i oftentimes wonder why people even need meat or dairy when vegan food can be made to taste this irresistible
we were seated at a wobbly table in the center of the restaurant when many more intimate options were available
in some ways it still feels like my house though
ive always had good to exceptional service at the weary and ive been there numerous times
service was ok we waited 15min or so before we were served
a favorite luncheon stop
most of it was upscale burger and sandwich type things
a surprising new gem in town
i should probably give 5th and wine 5 stars
will be back for sure
there were two gals and one of them took my initial order for a beer and every few minutes they would walk back into the room but not once did they ask me or any of the other 3 people i was sitting with if we needed another
we were so bummed and reluctantly finished our plates and made a dash for the door
we came again a few months ago
sound system sucked
around 6 pm they had someone playing live acoustic guitar in the already small taproom
bacon skewer  oh my god
the one thing i would complain about is the servers
the sample beers i tried all the rows except for the top row
but if there are no sales  well you get it
they did not start smoking the meats when we ordered
this is the biggest disappointment to hit vegas
the menu is well thought out the food is kinda bland but the portions are huge
unless that something is holymotherofpearlthesepeoplearecrazy and need to be visited if nothing else but for the amazing drama like amys baking company
im not so aggravated by the price as much as the execution and offerings were not really all that worthy of that price
i had previously been in here once during the evening when it had just opened up to the public but this was the first time i had been inside during the day
i understand this is a craft beverage place
i think weve dined here twice over the past few years  the food is good and the ambience is nice
service very friendly staff
these are outdoors chairs with a little recline and rocker
they keep it professional and personable
i got the milk thai tea with bubbles both times and i would highly recommend it
cmon well its grand opening gotta get some kinks out easily forgivable
a giant side of fries put this meal over the top
the food is good people are nice and my drink always stays full
it smells of some old remnant of las vegas aka rotten cigarettes and cheap liquor
granted it was monday afternoon so that would pretty much explain it
we were so shocked we didnt know what to do
also other servers we didnt know came by and picked up the empty plates fairly quickly
we never actually received the drinks from the waitress they were delivered by what i assume to be barbacks or bussersmore on this later
elegant and upscale eddie merlots is a great place to go for date night or stop by the bar and grab a drink and some appetizers
and a hell of a nice guy too
all in all a real disappointment
no to both
i could wrap the fish back around the rice which is so much more than can be said about most sushi places much less ayce
good fish fry on fridays
i will give them 2 stars for having good tapas although extremely pricey
definitely hands down the best veggie dog ive ever had
there is a huge gap between the mens and womens mirrors so make sure to check this out  i will be adding a updated review because i will be visiting again in april
passionfruit green tea with boba  great service
waited for several minutes to be seated and no one acknowledge me or my party
the most disappointing was that the 1st 2 people who ordered with the main group didnt even get their food after waiting almost an hour  they ordered the giant pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon
if you like to wait almost 40 minutes for 23 of your to go sandwiches to be made go here
cant say id come back other than for maybe a happy hour
not sure what they put in the queso dip but it was ridiculously good
food pros the food is delicious fresh perfectly prepared hot and filled with flavor every time
only 8 calories an ounce
first time when i was here i really didnt like it i guess because this place was new to all upscale look of downtown
rather than bumping the missed order to the front of the line they put it in as if we just ordered
we only had the beers here and they were pretty good brews
once the soup arrived i was pleasantly surprised
then for the salad  again id have preferred chicken but we took our servers advice and got the salads with the thinly sliced beef she suggested
we didnt end up going to the club upstairs afterwards but it looked pretty busy and cool
to our surprise there was no line and tables were aplenty and the sushi bar was pretty much empty
the line up of djs are pretty awesome too
how lucky was i that the roadway inn was two blocks away from this little secret gem
who cares it was all tasty and the back bar redolent of yesteryear with big leatheresque booths surrounding our chubby cherubic happy selves
only a year hence it was only fit for local sketchbags and hipsters
great salads and a large selection of local and ohio brews
however i do not feel it would be fair to share this experience as a way to improve the service
it is a little spicyso note that
tuna tartare a nice cold dish to contrast with the other things we got
this place started out as a place wed go for happy hour because it was near by
after 10 minutes she came to our table and asked for drinks
at least most of the staff was friendly
stinky uni will have me running for the hills in a hurry
service was very strange
bathrooms were clean
ambience is nice great music and decor located in the w hotel
was it one bad night
no space to put your stuff toothbrush makeup etc
went there for a family reunion of sorts watched the notre dame game  listened to a great band
the decor of the restaurant looks chic and upscale
somewhat of a dive but perfect for late nights after hitting downtown
vegan dairy free  gluten free
i know its phoenix and sushi is probably pretty hard to come by but to me this sushi was just average
theres no menu
we turned the corner and let out an oh i guess i hyped myself up thinking itd be a vegasstyle brunch based on the size of the restaurant and the raving reviews
definitely looking forward to coming back
isnt the whole point of a tip to give an amount based on the service you received
my hubby ordered the kobe burger a nicely seasoned chunk of kobe covered with cheddar cheese and wild mushrooms
i loved that everything we got came with dipping sauces
the only bad thing about the location was there was not a light overhead like other tables on the patio so you had to hold your menu up to the candlelight to read it
substantial doses of salt and pepper finally added some flavor to the dish
if my future experiences are anything like my experience last night this place would be a definite five star
ok it would be a 5star rating but i have to take a star away for the bouncersdoorman and this 1 rude ass bartender
i would have appreciated the hoagie i saw on the tube
maybe just nice
we loved the one out there
first visit  got the siam i am salad
i frequent the tryon location because del is a heels fan and a great bartender
youll first notice the atmosphere and with good reasonits perfectly lit with noticeable but not mindnumbingly blaring music and even better they have a live dj who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your wednesdaysaturday evening dining experience
dinner was very reasonable with all full dinners  we had leftovers under 19 and lunch looked very reasonable at under 10
paellas take 4560 minutes to prepare but are well worth the wait and price
being from out of town i didnt even know this place existed nor had i any predispositions
the worst dish was the flat bread with basil and tomatoes
rice great the beans amazing
when i was there there were at least 3 groups of girls either celebrating birthdays or getting married
very slow service and its very expensive for what it is
egg rolls and sushi was excellent
ive been to this yardhouse location a few of times on dates and it is without a doubt my favorite
who ever the manager or owner is  it may be a good time to have a chat with your front of house staff
and on the flip side someone can pay a ton and just be the dj for the nightwhether you like it or not
she was able to deal with our large group just fine and was prompt with serving us
really disappointing quality compared to the other places
any of the other sauces would just clash with the smoke flavor
great little neighborhood bar and grill
i understand your boba and teas are freshly made but like are you harvesting the tea leaves right now i shouldnt have to wait this long for a drink
no complaints about the arugula salad or potatoes either
the supervisor chris is condescending and obviously no customer service skills
a fabulous evening
both service and food were good
a steak is something that is fairly straight forward to cook and if a line chef cannot accurately gauge the doneness of meat then what other mistakes are being made in the kitchen and more so what is so difficult about cooking a steak
they for some reason wasnt serving alcohol so we def did not stay long
that doesnt really impress me im not going to lie
since then i have made a point to try wings at just about every restaurant that offers them as a menu option
unfortunately that ruined my experience once and am always hesitant to want to go back given the many other places in the city now
preparation was decently fast and our picture perfect snack was a sight to be seen
one had some bone marrow on top all of it was delicious
had a good time
fred said yes
no room for dessert but will return soon
anyways  spent the majority of my time here
get there early place your name on the list and wait
the friendly service staff pointed out the train stop history and to come back when its a little warmer to enjoy the patio
ive never been to a bar where they didnt at least have a list of liquor they served my bad
had the fish n chips for lunch last week
this place is a mess and filthy
still a smoking patio but no effects of this inside
the service was both speedy and polite
we were told we had to be out by a certain time 2 hours because another diner had made reservations
nice relaxed atmosphere with a mix of irish and modern music in the background and lovely irish decor
we walked from the rock and roll hall of fame 43 degrees and heavy winds but it was worth it
thats why it was completely empty when i went on a friday night
after about 3045 minutes a asked if there was going to be a hibachi grill open for us and the hostess again pushed us towards sitting at a regular table which we eventually did
around this time my wine tasted really good with oaky smell to it
both are overpriced but we did not mind during the lunch when we had a more laidback meal
we told our waiter who did not apologize but did offer to remake
weve been frequenting the dominion on queen for well over a decade and never miss a uke night so if you go for the live shows and beer youll have a great evening out
mango tango blue tini wings and calamari are the notable itemssht broncos 1427 right now oh come on
overall i was very pleased with our food and wine which was served in these beautifully tall glasses
oh well anyway  extrasrating you might be surprised they get even two starsand heck they really do not deserve them
not even a half a standard swig
instead of just telling him what beer they had or getting another menu he took it away from her
in terms of the food it was good
however lucky for comet that they have a great menu and killer burger
the server told us the special was veal chop parmesan but we only heard veal chop and envisioned something a little more pure and refined so when we got a breaded cut of veal covered in red sauce and cheese we were a little disappointed
this is the place to go if you love a beefy sandwich
its beautiful inside and out and had phenomenal service by rachel
there are relatively few places left where they dry age the beef inhouse
they do half rolls here so you can try a lot of the special rolls
i love their blarney fries
kay and i returned to pay the piper a couple of weekends ago httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvx9byhq6payfeaturerelated fortunately our visit didnt involve getting hit with chairs
the arugula salad 7 came with arugula piled high topped with bacon and onions with red and yellow watermelon adding a sweetness to counteract the mint vinaigrette
the menu is basically a tapas menu and wasnt very good
the staff were also super friendly and gave us hats from the wall to wear
my lunch entree was the turkey panini which i could barely bite because it was too toasted
draft pints run in the 5 range popcorn available 35 i think
the warm peanut butter cup dessert 6 was almost a sweet peanut butter soup served with a scoop of chocolate gelato in the center of the bowl with two cookies alongside
the bartender kept making it dirty despite our request not to
the bartender was so welcoming and warm
four stars because they wont let you order just flat wings rick ross said wing stop was the place to eat wingswrong its pts  this is a place that me and many of my coworkers go after work or after a late night party  singing they thinking filet mignon im thinking pts lemon pepperjk lemon pepper wings are the bomb baby
i ordered a baked potato with black beans and corn on the side as i am eating plant based with no oil
there were large pieces of garlic and what seemed like maybe almond slivers or something  it was crunchy
theres something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish
love this place and cant wait for more crab rangoon
we love good wings and we were not disappointed
overall very good restaurant attentive service and good ambiance
atmosphere is fun
i have always been hesitant to try le mont for the almost 3 years i have been in pgh due to somewhat mixed reviews my fascination with the nearby isabela which i always thought would be very hard to beat in romance views and relatively casual elegance and all right i will say it the old money hunch i had of the place
the drinks were tasty too although very sweet
our server was great and helped us each pick our flight
we ended up sitting near the bar and ordered beers
disappointing course sizes
we got hummus shrimp scampi quinoa salad and tacos
we ordered the margherita pizza a chicken pasta dish and another chicken pizza
good happy hour drinks specials
i was looking forward to it since my dinner was so gross
fun new gay nightlife option in las vegas
stunning views of the vegas strip including unparalleled seats for the bellagios fountains
the service was good they didnt have any other customers hello and they did turn on our game with sound
when i entered i was not greeted i made my way back to the patio area and still was not greeted
so this place gets two stars
the menu has something for everyone great gnocchi fantastic lasagna  layered with light al dente  pasta bechamel cream  tomato sauce and rich cheese hearty wild boar  pappardelle lovely linguini with either shrimp scampi or salmoneven their classic cheese pizza is pretty darn good
for dessert we had the chocolate truffleice cream in a ball rolled in truffle dust and mango ripienomango sorbet served in mango skin its really cool
karaoke was a blast and it was early too  8pm12am on saturday night
open space great design and fun games in the back
the food looked great but not tasty
i had the chicken katsu bowl for lunch it was great portion size was big tasted great
cons were mostly the price
even when they are busy the employees are friendly and courteous
according to echo the bartender yes its her real name
my main course was slow cooked check of beef in red wine sauce with spinach tomatoes olives and pasta gratin
i thought i was making it up
also love the atmosphere
youre joking right
this place is wonderful
both smoothies were very good
free parking at city hall on the week end main st exit puts you right across the street
the bartenders are the highlight and probably the most down to earth people in vegas
we had the filet mignon the beef wellington and the chocolate souffle
being in an adventurous mood i tried it
the food was pretty good and the wine was decent
theres a lesson there but what is it
a bottle of prosecco and 3 bruschetta for 29
im ready to pack up and go to her small town and see if everyone that lives there is as friendly and cute as her
we shared an order of each among three of us men and they didnt all get eaten
ive had japanese food 3 times in the past week first dinner at yes sushi on hanover street on friday then number one sushi on home street on sunday evening and finally izzi on lothian road for lunch yesterday
postbirthday pints with the main squeeze yielded a visit to a probable hauntmugshot tavern has all the components of a fantastic default destination in the roncesvalleshigh park hood
ilios noche is a greek  mediterranean restaurant located in charlotte nc and is part of the xenia hospitality group where it is all about hospitality or generosity
my only complaint is the ceviche a little to sour and too much onion
decor and setting was very cool
first time in and i will be back
if you have never had this its served in a stone pot and rice egg veggies and beef
one point i had to walk to the front to get a hostess to get our waitress because i was thirsty as hell and she was no where to be seen for another 30 minutes
spin appeals to a broad audience so expect a mixed crowd
the food is always tasty and great for sharing and discovering
they have free valet parking which is not usual for gastonia but is nice
my steak was savory an lobster was nice and sweet
it was the worst place we had ever been
bonus for ayce is you can do half rolls allows for more variety so why not
like most hookah lounges they play house music and have black lights and lasers
then was the pork belly steamed bunman oh mannot one thing wrong with it
corn was hard like it had been sitting and just warmed it up
the bus boy had a great attitude especially given there was a party of 8 next to us
we tasted tacos enchiladas and the corn
the five stars is for the fried chicken and mac cheese on a wednesday because you pick your piece
the service her is amazing bad
costing a whopping 60 it is only part of the pig but its a huge slab of meat
as to the main courses the grilled arctic char was very flavorful and the provencal halibut was delicious in a garlic sauce
excellent food and great service
the waitress was rude dismissive and didnt seem to care
fish tacos were watery and bland grilled and the lime rice was tasteless and undercooked
he made the experience dining here very enjoyable  thank you jose
the food was always really good
i have never sat in the main dining room and have always opted for sitting at the bar because i was looking for a fun relaxed night out filled with drinks and nibbles of food
the one part i couldnt get over was the service
but since i wasnt working a had the house mojito that was so good
we wanted appetizers first to start and we wanted the hawaiian kalbi the pork belly gyoza and bulgogi with rice
i like sitting at the bar because the service is usually so impeccable and you get lots of great advice
i love the skittles hall and generally the walk there after a trot around dr neills gardens or holyrood park is the perfect sunday but you should book
came here a couple times after my last review and the experiences were great
ok wait let me point out that the turkey sausage omelette was very tasty
the yellowtail was to die for
in fact i am most comfortable hitting up dive bars and hole in the wall ethnic places
place was highly disappointing and i wont be back
you can tell the spring rolls are made in house nothing too excting to say about spring rolls but they are 2
ooh im torn on this one
it is with great sadness i give sushi samba two stars one star is for new york and one for miami
really enjoy myself here
its expensive but cool
we were there on friday for winterlicious lunch
i dont have anything great to say but i dont have anything terrible either
i would definitely recommend checking this place out
had a great time was taken care of all night
they have great specials and its always packed so dont be upset if you have to park on the street
the biscuits are perfect better than my own
the food was soo good
the sushi was bitter tasting and the sashimi was scaly and not smooth
i have at mention the crowd had a good mix of ages
i can only guess that the owners must be putting positive reviews on themselves or that these reviews are written by tourists who have no taste didnt go to any other bars in montreal seriously try and of the other bars on the street theyre all better than this one or have never been to a bar before in their life
our favorite is their happy hour 12 off pizzas in the bar area
get to the airport early and skip the takeaway
except it was wrapped in an omelet
im normally not a burger person its way too messy and greasy for me
very good food and very good portions of food
pretty cool dive bar in southside
roughly 27 minutes after placing our order we were told that they were out of new york strip that my girlfriend had ordered
the best part about it all
its not exactly cheap but we always go away satisfied
having only been there twice i cant really say i know the entire menu
we ordered food and again not much wait  waitress on par fast and sweet through the whole ordeal
it is a little bbqy and just a perfect little hint of spicy
a testament to my yelp loyalty
i really hope its better this year because last year it was pretty horrific
the little time spent there defiantly makes me want to stay there
sat outside because it was a cool day not sunny unfortunately the misters completely wet my pants and toes so i dont recommend sitting outside
she was told there was a 2 service charge
now where is my straw
anyway the service here was slow but this lounge has my favorite drinks
but that didnt stop us
too bad we ran out of room for dessert
service was great our sushi chef was really good and made sure we were well taken care of
i think its the perfect firstdate spot on the strip because of thr tapas style dining
the decor was adorable and the rooftop had a fantastic view  perfect for instagram photo ops or chilling after work in the summer
after being seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come greet us and take our drink order
despite arriving without reservations to find the place very busy we enjoyed every minute
we had a real nice meal here a few weeks ago
the lovely bit of salmon was my favorite but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance i am not able to parttake in such loveliness any more   but nevertheless i still come here every now and then with my friends and husband
das ambiente und die location gefallen mir auch sehr gut stylisch aber nicht protzig
my parents noted that the sauce was too soupy but i didnt want to complain since i knew my dad liked the place
the cheese curds were good not the best i ever had but solidly good the crab dip was neither hot nor cold and the calamari were all rings properly cooked but also quite salty
managers were also busting ass like in a good way
i fully appreciated your service it was wonderful
overall flavored well but a bit messy to eat drippy drippy  im not sure how healthy this wrap was but after eating it i didnt feel so healthy
the location had my maps all upset but i found it nonetheless
very good service
half pound of deliciousness discovered on the n shore of pgh the accompanying pic that i took that day is uploaded here
especially since happy hour offers them at half price
and we got out the door for under a hundred bucks including a 20 tip
we first started out with the house salad for the guys and i had the caesar salad
when we asked for them the server almost seemed offended
i really enjoyed the fact you could order half rolls
let me give you the recipe  sriracha sauce mixed with cheap creamy peanut butter and a little italian dressing to thin it out
having said that however i would come back without objection just not top of my list
it was served with a variety of nuts and fruits and was a nice portion size better than grazes
we had the deviled eggs and they blew me away
irish pub with a great whiskey selection a generous pour and good fish and chips
c bar wasnt really packed on a friday ces night and its even pretty close to the soso valet
edit  they took the ipads out now there cheap piece of paper beer menu is just thata waste of paper
although if it had tasted better we probably would have eaten more
the manager has the people skills of a rock and with the stone face of a zombie tells us we cant order appetizers
i went on an extremely busy night where they had a 20 board and bottle specials
so then quentin the manager will give you the low down on drinks and specials
decided to take the fam out for dinner
i would go back after bathing in bleach and getting a tetanus shot
it seats several dozen and still feels a little barebones as though theres plenty of space to be filled with more decorations
schne atmosphre gute weinkarte flinker service
had the clam in white sauce and pastrami sandwich both good
buffalo chicken sliders were very good
and i cant help but love the presentation here it looks like a fallen log in the forest where you would sit and relax which tied it with the earthy mushroom taste of this dish
i am still eating it right now corona 8 free salty ass yum chips
i cant think of another one anywhere nearby
have been here twice now and both times my tastebuds were tickled with delight
lets start with how gorgeous this restaurant isstunningly beautiful
reminds me of korean style fried chicken which i had in cali which is way better
i will defenitely will remove this place from my reaturant list
im looking forward to the steak
there was no line and no wait which was great
the flavors were mild not at all too fishy which to me tasted fresh
we looked for a place to go for dinner but not surprisingly there wasnt much available
too much cream or mascarpone as 1 single layer
big shout out to dancer michael
im assuming they cooked the food when we ordered it and then just stuck it in the fridge i didnt even bother caller because im sure the dude would have been even more confused or high or whatever kids these days do
i was so impressed by the desserts i brought my family when they came to visit
we were able to split fajitas for two 3895 amongst the four of us
this entre was lacking and i do not recommend it
i wish the food was better
5 s what more need i say
it was my first time here  the inside looked really clean and really nice and spacious but the girl working was like kinda awkward and not very good customer service
the hubbys wings were ok  it was louder than a club and the wait was so long the food wasnt great i dont see us coming back
we told him we were thinking about ordering another flight then he just kind of stood there and waited for us to decided
we danced our asses off
theyre the same
the decor was also pretty increble
the serveyourself selection contains many of the usual suspects and a few surprises
this resto is located at south point casino near the south premium outlets
i have always walked by this little bar and never walked on in
i enjoyed the atmosphere but paid dearly for it
they do have a full bar with variety of drinks if you are looking for a spot to drink
jk jk jk  but really i had a lovely time here
this can range anywhere from fried catfish to bacon wrapped meatloaf
she also cant hear the things we say but shes the one with the softest voice with the i dont want to work here look on her face
heres what we had  white fish baked in foil  i forgot the exact name but with the veggies and sauce this was amazing
my chicken wrap was quite disgusting maybe thats why it was the lunch special
its me and my girlfriends new favorite spot
joeythis one is for you
if youre a mushroom lover youll love it
management is on top of things staff is attentive
the vibe is of a mom and pop coffee shop near a university
we loved the friendly professional staff the sushi and the wine recommendations
we then got our table it took another half an hour  to order and another 45 minutes to get our food  so time frame was now almost 3 hours since we got to this restaurant
we were passing things like crazy to try everything which i like that we could do
the tater tots are so good with literally a million sauces to choose from and its no charge unless youre adding actually toppings to your tots
thank you jordon for everything and for being our host
im a big fan of hibachistyle cooking and my old place on the south side was right down the street from nakama so i was excited to try it when i still lived there
welly is my default spot but that doesnt mean im happy about it
the sushi rolls we got were wonderful
groupon for 20 worth of food for 10 so i would definitely recommend buying one on your way in
i can get a better meal and 25 of the cost at a really good restaurant outside las vegas
a hamburger ordered medium was more like well done
and our friend who was splurging got the bacon wrapped prawns killer combo chow down on these and thank me later
nevertheless the service was friendly and the food was tasty
prices for items ranged from 3 to 12 typically 68 and there are many combination plates available for those who are overwhelmed with all the choices
they offer specials of the day and oyster selections may vary based on season
literally theres a boba shop on every frickin corner
my husband ordered the thai sauce boneless wings
great sunday brunch weve been to fork
i came for armin van buuren who killed it and will definitely be back on future trips to vegas
and im pretty cool come here for delicious drinks sweet pastries and awesome atmosphere
i have tried harveys a couple of times because it is so close to my house but i am always disappointed by the service
good beer selection good drinks but much better food at cph
waitress was very nice over all great service from our waitress
many are time consuming and as a staffer pointed out you can make the chocolate mousse at home easily
service was  fine but food was bad sushi rolls were really bad
i already knew what to expect from the tao experience and it was a welcomed seductive relief from the venetians baroque architectural jitters that hit me between the massage and dinner
if you dont already have a membership then you have to wait in line and purchase a membership card
it was a 20 min wait which is fine if i was in nyc or sf or even seattle but in tempe
bland to downright embarrassing
when i orders raspberry napoleon and what did i pulled out from my mouth after taking a bide
overall i didnt get the freshness here that i have tasted at many donut shops around the city
they taste like regular onion rings that you would get at a typical burger place
there is more wine than actual food
happy camper gotta come back for some karoake
the seating was minimal the buffet station wasnt going to feed 200 and the food was mediocre at best
place was small but nice
not warm but cold
a lot of customers seem to come here to study
the chips and scotch egg are both great apps
where is the sauce
but in the end nope full price charge never said a single word the entire time we sat there
the service was wonderful then again we were the only ones in the restaurant our server was super attentive and personable
case in point the new clam bake melt i got last night from the lakewood location
our waiter took more than 4 minutes to even come to our table and greet us and take our drink orders
i hard a hard time picking my meal because there were so many great looking options
might have to come back and try other items on the menu
i found out later my brother got an a on that test
first off this is not your typical las vegas casinoso if youre a traditionalistyou probably wont like this place
they were spicy and tasty i couldnt have the dip but it looked yummy
if only they stayed open long enough for the after show crowds to disperse
a place where i could sit at the bar for a few hours or come for a meal
i have seen various forms of this in other restaurant chains so it is not asking the impossible
however that beautiful long high table situated near the end of the bar and the mens bathroom should really be moved or even dont put a chair between it and the wall
nach kurzer zeit kamen die vorspeisen und was soll ich schreiben sie waren alle ein genuss auch der weine der uns zu den vorspeisen empfolen wurde ein stettener mnchsberg weisburgunder war absolut die richtige wahl
i will definitely be coming back to eat here again and again
our server was an interesting woman who sported a nosering and was wearing a skirt that was way too short
unfortunately farm and craft didnt get that message
the bathrooms w  clean
i have been to this location pretty frequently over the last few years
we spent four hours chatting
i havent had fries this good sincesinceget the point
welcome home to jjs
i was really looking forward to little sister but found it to be overrated and represent the worst parts of tapasstyle dining
poor waitstaff seemed overwhelmed even though it was almost empty
dont get me wrong the sushi is very good
very fast service and happy staff
light zesty and perfectly balanced
salsas very good especially their salsa verde nice full flavor with the roasted tomitilloes shining through the right amount of spice
i then had the meatball sandwich  homemade grind that was served over grits with bread to scoop up all the deliciousness
bonus i now have a cool painting for my garage
may i add they gave us a complimentary sushi dish would have been a pleasant apology if all of us werent having theyre all you can eattheyre poke selection outside the restaurant is goodidk if that counts
overall a very nice place
if not its accessible by public transportation or cab
the mushroom marmalade added a layer of savory sweetness while the warm toasted added a nice crunch
who wouldnt love that
dumpling meatloaf even the vegeburger was very disappointing to taste
ive never been inside but i love that they are a nonpizza option for food delivery in surprise
they offered extensive glutenfree options for my sister including her favorite crme brle
i ended with the raspberry white chocolate cannoli mini dessertjust enough to fulfill my sweet tooth
if you want to just close down and have an employees only party then drop some hints before i waste precious time thinking ive found food and drinks still open on a sunday night
dont refuse or say no
had to go to the bar to get my own after sitting invisibly for quite a long time
best things we had  lobster potstickers  amazing very good
but its definitely a great way to start the night or a nice pit stop if youre just walking along the strip
highly recommend this place for first dates
irish mug
the burgers are seasoned and cooked to perfection
no complaints with this place
but they have a pretty good list available you just have to ask for it
im not sure how the previous restaurant was  but im sure it was nothing like the current
make sure to leave room for dessert
we were almost speechless at the goodness but thankfully next came tongue en brioche
they use the big round squid which normally i dont like as much compared to the smaller rings but they were good here
the rogue burger is amazingthey put a sunnyside egg in it and when the yolk explodes over the burgerwow
usually two choices
thats life though
the fried chicken here is amazing so make sure to grab some
our server was very friendly and knowledgeable the atmosphere is nice
all in all this restaurant is solid great service great food and a crisp fresh ambiance
did the ribs chicken brisket and burgers  cant wait for the all day breakybrunch  the place is slick and welcome to little portugal  your smokin
this is the way to get to the clubs the river a spring training game wherever you need to go
we will definitely be back
i asked for a bite and he gave me an entire rib
i had a good experience there 2 years ago
when visiting vegas come to thisevening call location
me and my girlfriends had the best experience
using the best products
i rate it a 355 but will be generous because of the great taste in music
tips  make reservations a few weeks in advance if youre going on a weekend  get the tasting menu course  cocktails are delicious
i usually will gobble up their food they havent finished but it wasnt worth the extra calories
the service leaves much to be desired
i sick of those nasty casino taking all the musicians
must have been one guy in the kitchen
some menuborn promises such as a chocolatecovered plantain in the russkie see stupid names are satisfied in name only
and the crunch soup which is free btw is so addictive
overall a delightful and pleasant experience
we had to ask every time we required a water refill and everything took a while to get to our table
my wife order a wrap and i order a salad
staff was very prompt and friendly
he never once asked how the food was
fillet and chickenehi found the flavors lacking the steak a little chewy and the chicken boring
it was delicious
there was one kid with tood but he recovered
the menu selection was limited with little irish favorites
the potato chips were again very hot and came with a bunch of cheese and sour cream
i also tried out the pineapple margarita
we will definitley be returning soon
in my opinion one of the best thai food restaurants in vegas
menu looked pretty hipster so we thought to give it a try
well be back and well bring friends
wont go back
i asked my daughter to tell the waitress i needed a refill of sierra mist if she came back before i got there
the waitress then proceeds to tell me if she had known about my allergy she couldve done something about it
more like dog faces and pigs is all i could see therethere was vomit on the ground and to make it worse sticky beer on the floor which no one cleaned
when she came back we were ready for drinks and a food order but she ran away with only our drink order
i really really do not want to think he did this on purpose but i am so sorry to say it seems as if he did
my mom thought she was being extremely rude so i had to explain to her that she was just doing her job
while it was just a tad more salty than i would have liked the taste was amazing
the staff needs to understand that you have to be nice  to the people to get them to come back
the dishes were all very good
she brought us four different drinks to try and we were happy that we got to try a selection of drinks
4 tostada fills me up
sweets raku always ends my night after a great dinner
i was introduced to akane by a colleague and havent looked back since
i really liked the avocado salad  the veggies
overall this is a good place to have some drinks and food with your friends
we ordered the slider bar and they give you so much food
very quick service
go tuck yourself in mr security guard
the fries were hot and my ice tea was fresh
i cannot get enough of this place
my foot was stomped on and a beer was poured on me
fast fresh and fair
we were pretty impressed
how do you write a review for a place that is hands down amazing
they had a good selection of smoothies smoothie bowls granola and other snacks
just need to get some shade up on that patio and you are all set
each item was pretty good and presentation was beautifulbut im not an iron chef judge so id rather have a little more quantity for the high price
just dont let the location throw you off from the enjoyment of a supurb mexican dining experience
secondly that was obviously a lie since we all left at the same time  and the friend the server claimed to have contactedgiven my stuff to had lost his phone when leaving the club that night
i was here with a really large group for teppanyaki
i will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head
i was watching some old guy manning the pizza oven cooking and slinging out the flatbread pizzas left and right and it made me want one
you disappoint me john q fraternity
the service is excellent and they are always eager to accommodate any special request
get players card and print discount coupon
the appetizers are amazing including the crabcakes
i have made several of his dishes in my own kitchen and always have gotten praise for the dish especially his  slamma jamma parmigiana  and his  rice  a munie
good quality fresh modern food not cheap and commercial junk like youd see at applebees or chilis
it has a great vibe throughout and the late night gogo dancers above the table games are a nice touch
good advice from employee and nice clean facility
multi smaller levels
had the best meal in a long time
the staff are so friendly and always attentive
shout out to john for the experience
the last time we were there we had their burgers and they were amazing one of the best in town
i have eaten there before with mixed feelings but our meals there yesterday were simply unacceptable
this keg is located on the esplanade just east and one block south of the sony centre
im so glad it opened on the waterfront
the first time i went i had teriyaki chicken and the second time i went i had sushi
the wine selection is very good but i was quite disappointed in the quality of the food
sat at the sushi bar with kyle and ordered omikase
we went without reservations of course to another nice restaurant where immediately upon entering the door and saying it was our 45th anniversary they treated us like royalty
with over 18 years as a chef and restaurant consultant my suggestion would be to terminate all of the staff and start over with professional people that may look out for the good of the restaurant
i recently visited this location though i had been to the one that used to be in peoria before
finally be sure to try the grilled chicken tacos and the asian chicken salad
this restaurant looks like an illustration off the page of a storybook
in the girls room i didnt notice one  we left with the umbrella song in our heads and a few days later we looked it up and realised it was a rihanna song
the portions were nice for the price
theres something ironic about az88
blends are 1011169 ounces with a four day shelf lifefrom the date processed and a 1 deposit for every returned bottle
no good pho is without a great avocado shake 3 and im happy to say their avocado shake was fairly sized and blended well
my boyfriend had the salmon and not only enjoyed it but cleared his plate as well
edamame didnt come out very hot
my first time was for a bridal shower  the staff managed it fantastically always quick in bringing more food and drink and never ever seeming overwhelmed
came here at 10 and its closed i dont know if this is yelps fault or the businesss fault but disappointed
i would highly recommend the buffalo pizza with celery
and it also happens to have quite a reputation for being a bit of cougar bar and the place for the 40 single set to be seen and take home that recent divorcee and test drive his new maseratiher new boob job
its a little out of the way but ill be back
ernesto attended to our every need as blazingly fast as the show goeshe made sure that everyone was well taken care of
i will say watching them work their magic was memorizing
we will be back
this place is adorable
the service was great they have wetnaps paper roll saltpepper on every table
todays meat was pork cheeks that was rich and tender
the downside as ive mentioned is the seating
good for conversation a generous serving a pasta and perhaps a nice bottle of italian red for a reasonable price
the flavors not that there were any just collided with each other and overall it didnt work together
drink was lacking sweetness but waffle was delicious
themorningmacshot  do it xo
boy were we wrong
hero burger the only thing that made it a hero was that it was served on a toasted hoagie roll instead of the traditional burger buns
the servers are friendly and a great spot to watch sports
my bowl literally was just your typical spaghetti and meatballs that i could have made at home but was more costly
twin orders of bacon wrapped scallops were good as were orders of grilled asparagus but the twin slices of grilled sweet potato were beyond blah
which i really appreciated
after some good eats my friends and i hit the dance floor
you dont get a second chance here with most of your guests
it is pricey
the food is okay
and who wouldnt want to check out a rooftop dance floor with excellent views of vegas
not that bad not really awesome
on that note they do keep a well stocked bar here with lots of vodka etc and pints available
its the best way to enjoy a little bit of everything
the only thing i didnt like was we were a party of 2 on this banquette area for other parties of 2 and frankly it was just too tight
maybe an order of vegetable chow mien too
during the conversation one of them started to look really ill they were both obviously drunk and before we knew it the illlooking one was vomiting in the corner of our table
a lounge yes but a dive bar no it seems that if a bar doesnt have shiny stuff loud dj music and young people its called a dive bar
i would probably try something else if i decide to come back again
the fresh cucumber was the perfect touch
you can also get beer ofcourse
bakersfield is nothing short of fabulous
the 12 order was still to much for me
for diner she had the coq au vin but againlack of seasoning
jacks is a place ive been to a million times usually before or after dees enroute elsewhere or to meet up with someone
once we ordered it did seem like it took a little longer than normal to get the food out
they have gluten free bread which is awesome for those of us with celiac
they didnt even remove my appetizer dishes until my meal came
could skip main and swap them for their desserts easily
at least make the difference in the customers favor
the food is delicious you can tell its made in house
i had the shrimp burrito bowl
we had the cheese onion mix and spicy chicken
but didnt expect it to be at of all places some townie bar i ran in to in order to briefly avoid the snow
it is a nice area to get away from the crowds on the strip and enjoy the beautiful village by the lake
the sushi was prepared fresh
bottom line  youll leave impressed and craving more
i have not been in this coffee house for sometime but im glad i stopped by
there floors are dirty and the bathroom looks disgusting
56 north gets my recommendation because it was unpretentious welcoming with better than average food
if the goal is friday lunch just dont go
the beer pong table is great and frankly i am angry more places dont have it
if your a cool customer and dont wear your golf glove to the bar they will let you order takeout from another restaurant and eat it here
the blue and battleship grey decor doesnt help in that regard
our guests were just thrilled with the concept of paella as a catered event and absolutely loved the food
dont know about the hotel
well this is your kind of place if tgats what you like
i was not too happy about it
as much as i love the original postino this one is equally amazing if not a little better
great to catch up with friends have a first date or even to just eat alone
and even though i couldnt hear her our waitress was really nice and kept our drinks filled
i would much rather spend a few hours with a couple of friends in this welcoming and non threatening atmosphere than at a bar where strangers get in my personal space and dance too close to me
the problems  the cost the frantic distracted absent andat the endsomewhat pushy waiter dessert
probably ate enough for mercury poisioning
if not in the mood for sushi the ramen bowl is amazing
al in all the culinary highlight of our trip
the fresh bread they bring to start with soy olive oil is really great as well
i was concerned that i was not dressed very warmly for the cooler space but the temperature was still warm enough for me
but once he did he was very nice
it blew the venitian for us
maybe it was cooked just before the lettuce on the grill top
i drink a lot of arnold palmers and they happily brought me plenty of refills
food is decent
also ordered 2 order of salmon sashimi
i read a previous post about the big fish sandwich so i decided to give it a go
others want to be shown stuff
i wish someone told me it would be the biggest waste of 12000 ive ever spent
not only was the theater posh the lobby and whole experience was hip and luxurious
apparently picasso is not the place to order cocktails as my wifes cocktail came out so unpleasantly bitter that she actually had to return it after a second confirming sip
in addition if you didnt have a breakfast coupon evoke is pretty  for a simple breakfast so it might not be worth it
i traveled to az for a soccer tournament and we needed to cater a meal for three of the teams which were staying at a nearby restaurant
the mix was ok definitely had better
i dont even know how to describe the taste to those wings
ive been several times and though the items are consistent i cant say that anything strikes me as being delicious or earning a rating higher than an aok average price for the specialty rolls is 13 but they all taste a lot a like  cream cheese lots with tempura tuna or crab
we will definately be back
i will never eat at this place again
for dessert we ordered the key lime pie cheesecake and creme brulee
drinks were short pours yet higher than most other finer dining establishments
5 margherita flatbead
then they will include lunch meatstyle corned beef which just pisses me off
i ordered the spicy sausage and olives flammekuche but substituted the olives for mushrooms
we ate sushi when we were there and were very surprised by what they have to offer
they are pretty sweet
love their food and they always come hot and quick
the jambalaya farfalle has shrimp chicken andouille sausage peas peppers and onions packed with flavor and spiciness for 16
visited armitage bistro for the first time yesterday with high hopes seeing as though its a wine bar and we really love bomberos postino and 5th  wine elsewhere in the valley
what is missing
love the ground its hard to stop eating
but heres the thing15 for three small tacos is steep and theyre not as plentiful or flavorful as bomb tacos
how positively unseemly
we will give it one more try
salmon was the only one that was not dried
great locals spot
so i sat at the bar and couldnt hear myself think over the pink that was blasting
relentless in our forgiveness though we decided that if we were here we might as well get a drink mistake 3 unlike my two compatriots who ordered bottles the smart choice i opted to get the draft chambly
great prices and amazing food especially happy hour under 20 for a meal for two
the staff offer great recommendations and the quesadilla is probably the best ive found in vegas
other tables had entire plates of food that were untouched
well they advertise they have smoothies
i have never been to a place that done that unless i sat at sushi bar which felt little odd
who would have thought you could get such authentic izakaya in a strip mall off the strip in lv
disappointed as i was a strong advocate for paying fast food employees more
bought a red bean milk tea
portions are big so go hungry
at least our family had some serious free time for chatting and tablet time in between dishes
i got a chance to try a few select appetizers that were delicious
some at the table had to ask to place a food order which the server reluctantly took
my beer was nice and cold also
for me my quality barometer of a sushi place is its uni sea urchin
we ended up having a good time and eventually made it into the bar area
the bartender was rude she didnt say thank you or smiled
then why have i lived in charlotte for so long and never tried copper
awesome strawberrybanananutella crepe
hoping to go back try something new and to give a better rating
i have absolutely no problem paying for a nice steak dinner but its gotta be worth it
stopped for lunch at this relatively newcomer to the local eating scene
the server  wendy was good and friendly
we ended up doing 2 orders of the torched stuff because it was so good
ok so the witch doctor wow
the only bonus was that they did not add the rice to my bill
but since we were craving for good sushi we decided to visit jjanga at decatur blvd
but the stout is not bad and the amber is actually pretty damn good
the oysters came out almost immediately as there were three guys shucking nonstop all night long
the bartender was super friendly and mixed some excellent drinks especially considering it was his first day on the job or at least he told us it was
for example loud creepy drunk obnoxious asshats hooting and hollering at the girls walking past who obviously arent into it and one of them trying to pick a fight with a female friends of ours when she politely points out to them that this tactic is not going to get them laid and is kind of douchy in much nicer words
ah the four kegs
very very good
good thing i have some connections got there saw my boy and off i was in within 10min
today victoria day we werent sure where to go that would a be open and b not be crazy busy before the game
there coffee is ok i guess
i love their house fried rice and their chicken teriyaki is awesome
pizzas are good here as well
oh you guys are artsy
10 got me a dozen pieces miso soup and a salad
i loved my experience at copper blues
really cheap and fresh sashimi that is served in a space that resembles the trailer that budd lived in from the quentin tarantinos kill bill vol2
this place cracks me up
the partybar area seemed to have a lot of people having fun but for the quality of the food and the price was not the greatest
i think sipping drinks in those old school mugs and thermoses is great and would like to see all the drinks come in those types of cups
he also has a nice smoothie menu from fruity to green juice
i would like to say i am just paranoid but when i sat down i saw point at me and told her coworker something
bad daddys did its local brand a disservice by opening this location
the music was okay for me since i didnt recognize a lot of the songs they were a bit older songs but it was still fun
i loved the kama grilled yellow tail collar
got it non alcoholic which saved 3 bux but was still pricey at 8
so i ordered
the staff was super professional
i can totally understand why theyve gotten klnd of a cult followingloved them
everything was delicious
the pineapple was pretty delicious too
ive heard some interesting and terrifying stories about the ladies room but all in all amsterdam is comfortable and fun you can dance inside or out mingle and smoke and drink at the same time on the weird tiki patio
the onion rings are fantastic
i didnt expect it to be so good but id recommend it to anyone
rien de fancy mais cest bon
the staff is fantastic yet warm
while we didnt have room we still ordered the applecrumble for dessert and im glad we did
if its your first time here go for the lobster pan roast and the raw oysters
wir parkten direkt hinter dem haus auf den parkpltzen die zum haus gehren
the shrimp was plentiful in the dish however i found myself wanting more mushrooms and the egg was hard boiled i had been hoping for a poached egg one with a runny yoke
i tried the unagi don pretty girl roll and tunasalmon sashimi
note this new location for duckworths is just down the street from the old location but the reviews and photos are still the same
you will leave with leftovers
the quality of everything has been slowly dropping bit by bit
i had no choice but leave and want to warn all people how bad the service is
the bartenders are great and tolerant
service was extremely slow
so its not ideal if you want a quiet romantic dinner
i had it and she wasnt lying
get some real experience in there and some training on who your real customer is
we cooked the meat well and it was definitely not our cooking methods
i would definitely recommend
after waiting patiently for our table in the cold we were seated in the back of the restaurant
i had never been to davidson before so it was nice to see what the area had to offer
must see in mesa
it came with a mountain of home fries and 2 huge and thick slices of buttered sourdough bread
the fish bones were supposed to be deep fried and so crunchy that you can just eat them but the truth is not so
drinks were decent and the decor was beautiful
well worth it for the quality of food and service
my boyfriend ordered the wings i got the irish nachos
big fan of bars where waiters dont punch patrons
we had to ask for silverware and ice for the iced tea that had none
be sure to join their beer club and definitely check out the annual oktoberfest
keep on truckin
the lychee longan didnt have enough slush texture for me
when we asked to wait for an occupied table we were told no
the other guests were happy with their choices as well
very filled and the pastry outside perfect
ive only been to this one location but it appears brown derby has other locations in the cleveland area
young couples retired couples nfl logod groups of guys all enjoying themselves
food was overly i mean extremely salty
the cutlet is stuffed with a bit of greens
then we shared 3 pizzas  a salad btwn the 4 of us
shes super attentive and cool
lastly i would be remiss if i didnt mention that its one of the most beautifully appointed restaurants in all of las vegas
colossus next door has some of the best and most authentic greek food in gta west with reasonable prices
and it wasnt very busy either
little did we know we were in for more flavors and textures
from the pizza to the appetizer pretzels you wont be disappointed with the dough
i ordered the famous coconut blt they use liquid smoke and nutritional yeast then dehydrate the coconut meat and stupidly got a side of roasted potatoes
2 vodka and redbulls at the bar55
we got the oreo cheesecake from the bakery and were not disappointedthey chose bakeries well
you can order pretty much just beer and fried chicken and other korean side dishes
the list had only 3 types
we order the mexicoitalygermany and the europa all  crepes were delicious great flavor
these guys are fast patient and nice
been here many times
food was superb i had the diver scallops not the best ive had but still very very tasty
yes its like walking into a chilis with mexican decor
i wouldnt make a special trip to come back but i certainly wouldnt not not come again
we started with the wild boar sliders and the steak and fontina quesadillas
the prosciutto wrapped asparagus was almost inedible
so i assumed that i was in the industry as well as management and female security i assumed since they made him remove his necklace that the normal would be no hats clothing etc well  not the case here
everything is so good and not too sweet
didnt eat any of the food but the beers were somewhat expensive
kinda mushy and not as appetizing
i prefer a sheet sometimes to cover up with instead of a blanket
additionally we had a large party of 10  ordered two bottles of wine and without asking they opened two additional bottles and kept pouring
if your a vodka fan this is your place
our waiter was very friendly too
it was a very upsetting evening and i barely touched my food
overall just ok
dah  we werent in our home city
and please please please order your drink with no ice
they have a tiny menu of pots youll see what i mean if you go
cant wait to come back
ambiance is everything
i always stop there for lunch
there are a lot of patrons who ooze that i think i should live in the east village of nyc and you should think i am as trendy and cool as possible by wearing strange clothing and mismatching as much as possible type there are also the large group of awkward males who bother you all night until you dance with them
they also threw some tomatoes in with the mussels which was a nice fresh addition to the dish
we had the charcuterie platter oysters jamon serrano and the patata bravas as appetizers
im not into the shows and i tend to avoid the higherend dining experiences except for the occasional casino steakhouse with friends
the only reason im actually giving this place two stars and not one is because of the manager
the table near is ordered the ahi tuna ceviche salad which is served as a stack dish and looked super
the draft selection is extensive and features many different wisconsin breweries
honestly i dont really wanna let youll know anymore about bjs and their 899 thursday nights prime rib deal
we went for lunch in friday jan 31 and priscilla was our server
all i can offer is my personal experience i have had to go to wacky wings a few times in my life and every time i leave feeling tired sad and mildly ill there are good ways to do wings beer and the big game
how can you mess up chicken
second fse is mainly about this light show they display on this roof running several blocks down fremont
nothing stood out in my mind except their roasted potatoes were really good
we choose the less crowded non fire pit one
this place also has amazing raw vegan cheezcakes
whats the deal lucille
we had coffees and earlier with the meal the mister had an old fashion which was also very tasty
my date got the meatloaf and it was cold as a brick when it came out to us
bottom line too expensive for what you get
however a combination of the really dim lighting and the fact that it was too busy to see my feet meant that nobody really noticed
the best experience ive had has been lunch with friends and ordering the bento box  i uploaded a picture of it
what makes waynes stand out are the sauces and seasonings
like i said its a beautiful place
im used to the egg in my katsu don being much less well done than this
food is spicy and always cooked just right
he offered us a beer on the house but  at that point we just wanted to get out of this place
i give this place 4 stars cause i eat alot of sushi and i live in seattle
not the work phone
i usually come here about once or twice a month if i want a quick sushi fix
being totally bored by most of the citys current nightclub options i was very impressed with the cobra experience on friday night
we decided to try the queso fundido as we are both huge fans of most queso dips
i still need to try their happy hour
there is also a sense of exclusivity  you cannot go onto the floors of the hotel spa or residences unless you have a card key to do so
empanadas were boring and the frittes have a strange consistency to the crust
it was truly godawful
i complained to the server and all she did was trying to make excuses for what happened and never said sorry in any sincere manner
my favorite sushi spot in the city
tall windows let natural light inside and you can also see into the kitchen from the street on approach
it doesnt even take a person who is a merchant to know that
fifth a wall of taps sixth they have tvs with sports but i wouldnt call it a sports bar
a definite alternative to some of the other morning snack options
its a little bit of the beaten path being upstairs at planet hollywood but where that might impact their foot traffic it more than makes up for in the fabulous strip view they have in one part of the restaurant
i went in about 645 on a wednesday
830 am on a sunday morning brunch
they start you off with fresh super delicious baked bread
we were told they had live music scheduled for 8pm but we didnt stick around long enough to find out who or what that meant
the newly renod atmosphere live music large patio selection of drinks and some of the food is great
ive been to chaya a couple of times and each time has been impressive
i would say their food is predominantly chinese and thai inspired
walter white aka heisenberg works here during night shifts
good live music from wicked powers and cheap beers on friday night had me in a great mood
they did give us a chefs special and it wasnt all that great
way bette replaces in oldtown
everything about this place was painfully perfect
we gave up and left without ever being seated
this is new mexican food as in that state next door not new as in nouveau or anything pretentious like that
seasoned just right hot and steaming and gives my own eggplant parm a run for its money
being located across from the air canada centre they have full right to take advantage of pricing
the concept of the food we would give a 4 or 45 rating
service was great and my booth was comfy
our waiter was very good
there was a pretty good selection for their lunch specials
i let them know short of redesigning their theaters and updating the chairs they wouldnt get me back in to their establishment
the mixed broccoli cauliflower and carrots were a perfect accompaniment
friendly staff but food wait time was a bit lengthy
good  strong drinks from the bar
service was topshelf very friendly servers attentive and timely
one of my friends explained what happened to a manager at the front desk afterwards so that he was aware
our waitress recommended over the rainbow roll which was excellent with just the right spiciness
we liked one of them so much that i purchased a bottle
very unique flavors you wont find anywhere else in ne ohio
loaded with different cheeses and bacon
gave him our either order and ordered cocktails as well
i and another person went for the lamb sausage and it was great
the bbq isnt really very good
other than that it has all been good
but their attitudes are the worst
even though the menu doesnt specify almost every entree ive had has been battered and fried the only difference is they throw a sauce and a few vegetables on it
different wood simple rubs and of course tritip are what set this apart from regular bbq fare
the ramen here is quite tasty and ranks among the best in terms of taste and quality
this time i tried katsuya
though i do wish they would give more salsa with their food it was a great experience and atmosphere
i thought it was miso soup and drank it but they do bring you another bowl of real miso soup later
order the queso fundido for your appetizer
service was excellent on a wednesday evening around 8 pm
stackd makes great burgers and considering that theyre only 3 dollars on tuesdays its really awesome
due to the immense size of our meal i did not get to enjoy more of them that night but wow were they good
if your idea of special is warm spicy tuna rolls and chicken that tastes like someone made it in a toaster oven then mikado is pretty damn special
i dont have too much to say about this club
damn did red star come through for me
i wish that there was a bigger helping of cornbread but alas it hit the spot
i have had a milkshake once and its really good and when ive gotten the fries they are good as well
you wouldnt believe the experience we had here
amex treats its customers fantastic
lol we had a watermelon and lime mimosa that was so bomb i couldnt just stop at 1 i dont remember our waitresses name but she was awesome
the sushi is excellent as is the ambiance
i loved everything that we ordered and it truly was an amazing dining experience
full bar with awesome draft beer selection
i have brought in a pretty sizable group of 1618 people for the last few preseason games and have not been disappointed
again the portion was huge
if you want the house made chips crispy youll have to get on that pile quickly but its so worth it
5 use your free drink passes at the bar and order something strong
we didnt stick around last night but apparently women get a free martini and free manicure on thursday nights
she called over someone but that person quickly went to book an event for people that were behind me waiting to be seated
good wine selection for any pairing with any entree
live music on the weekends makes it a fun place to work and hangout at
i cozied up to the bar and ordered a drink
craft your restaurant is crafted beautifully
the place seems family run and the staff is friendly and are quick
i went to blue 32 last night and the food is just fantastic
the holy grail of grilled cheeses
they have an impressive business plan and i cant wait to go back once the beer garden in open
better than most of your sports bars that have won awards looking at you half moon
and did i mention ive been drunk
i came here at night
lots of sarcasm
price isnt too bad but the service was really slow
los cucos is one of the only mexican sit down restaurants in this neighborhood
im not the best cook by any means but my pasta is much better than this stuff
worst smoothie bowl ive ever had
when our friend arrived she had to wait at least 10 minutes until i finally flagged down a bartender to get her a drink
we had ordered 2 appetizers one of which was i believe texas caviar and the other an order of bone in chicken wings
as much as the restaurant is about the food its also about the experience
the place was pretty packed and he always made us feel like we were his only table
when we did get our food the las vegas roll the sunset a veggie roll and some seaweed salad it was all delicious
my mates have been raving about this place and i finally found time to grab a brew with them
this waitress dafne was very rude had a bad attitude unprofessional the host in the front of the restaurant would not give her name was rude to other guests that was there for a party and asked to speak with a manager theres no manager available
he ordered it medium and it was closer to medium rare and very pink
the decor hasnt changed
they also have a pretty good drink menu with lots of options
so so good
shes friendly and gave me samples of a couple different beers before i made my selection
should have known we were in trouble when there were what appeared to only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant
i walked back in and asked the same hostess and she had a deer in the headlight look and said the heaters were not working
i cant think of another that was any better and ive had a lot of burgers in my day
lost our gift card
it  was way too soggy and had only 2 tortillas
but thats okay i guess i didnt really need it
the cheese on my enchiladas looked like it had been sitting out for a while
it just didnt fit
i come from a culture where its normal to bribe but not normal to solicit and ask  i really feel like the door staff has taken the bribe thing too far at this venue and are basically running a business within a business
6800 with no beverages and no desserts
the atmosphere is really funa great place to bring your girl or guy because they have all kinds of classic games battleship operation hungry hungry hippos and many more
i couldnt have asked for a better date
i really like the food at mellow mushroom and i can honestly say ive never ordered anything i didnt like
once in a while no one is even going to notice
ive only ever heard good things about the food which makes me want to revisit for a brunch date
accidentally mistook my friend jason from far away and when i said hey jason this shady dude said im not jason but ill certainly be him
if you call it in make sure they read it back
theres nothing better than drinking a glass of wine next to a beautiful lake
the husband also tried their spicy ramen and he was a happy diner
its too bad this stand doesnt offer vodka could have gotten some at the burger joint bar and brought it over i suppose but it does offer wine if you want
i ordered a cocktail which was tasty but i felt literally nothing after drinking it if im going to pay 9 for a cocktail i expect it to contain enough alcohol to at least have some effect
they do not have high chairs
kiltlifter always a staple too
admittedly second or third best sushi i have had in life but an incredible bargain for half the price of the others
i wish i could give this 6 stars
was seated quickly and our server sean was very prompt
a lot of the rolls come with a crab salad that would be better as simple crab
we arrived at the end of happy hour and i ordered tso tso cauliflower and 2 balls of fire
burrata was perfection
also had a taste of of the hand crafted hand pumped ale if it was not for the triple ipa i would have enjoyed it but the triple ipa  spoiled my taste buds
yum tried the duck confit salad and seared foie gras again this place has not disappointed foie gras was nicely prepared always love it here duck confit salad was nice nothing spectacular but hey its a duck salad
my husband was shocked
there was a small piece of crackled peanut butter by the tart
and garlic fried chicken was equally delicious
my mom recently passed and alot of the patrons and staff loved her and showed their love at her service so thank you guys for being amamzing
the staff is extremely attentive and the hibachi is top notch for a buffet even has raw eggs you can add
every time has been great
we got the tiramisu for dessert and it was really tasty
we tried a few rolls
this place is great
like others have said  i cant say ive ever sat inside  because i love being outside so much
and i highly recommend eating here as often as you can
reminds me of atrias
you would think a new place would make an effort to provide outstanding service
the lightly crunch with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon combination is over the top
however they told us that 4 months ago
we packed it up to go
both very good
this one is a lot more intimate setting
best sushi ive had in ajax
my wife got the kickstand which she said was four stars
vince neils totally disappointed
i was curious what would happen if i went over by 5 mins
we came down here to meet friends who were in from canada
lotus of siam which is considered very good and a must try had just been over thrown in vegas and this place blows it away
i am glad he did as not only did i go there to watch gonzaga butler game i came back to see the ravens vs patriots games
the environment was nice and quiet
definitely beats sitting a smoky casino all day
there were plenty of water or beverageofchoice breaks between dances
try the glutenfree chocolate cake
paid 40 for two of us
no one was talking
yes we know big groups you have to add gratuity i get it
the chulupa and chimichanga was on point and very yummy
good atmosphere and helpful staff
this was served beautifully with cucumbers masago lemon slices and daikon
ask for sylvia she is da bomb
i agree with previous reviews about the bread needing to be toasted or something
next time i will be clear on the bread pudding situation
this is the place to gologans menu is great sooooo many choices and combinations the bar is very large and the music is really good
nice waiters nice staff
opal lounge is a popular choice for a night out at the weekend
we will not be back and will tell everyone else and the yelp community to stay away from this rip off restaurant
i love thai food and spent several years in thailand
they had a cool dj that was different than the other onece
i got the classic benny with spinach and home fries
it took a good 2030 minutes for us to receive the pipeso make sure you know this before going in
good atmosphere and bartenders
tired of old town
the place itself has a cool laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly
well be back soon
should i ask before asking for more ice saltpepper
the chicken and waffles were good
come on sls get it together and good luck
on top of the female bartender was awesome and hilarious
overhyped but still reputable is there such a thing
another worthy mention  the kfc korean fried cauliflower it feels just like a korean fried chicken but its made with cauliflower
bjs has been under construction for awhile and it finally opened the other day and im so happy that it did
unsurprising not many blacks
every roll is nicely rolled up so nothing falls apart
of course id been there not on my own with a friend of mine but for a lonely person its quite ok to go there too and drink a couple of shots or cocktails
the dining room is dark and each table is fairly private it was a very cozy spot to enjoy company
the service was good theyre a little young and green so be prepared but they do have the desire to please which is refreshing
ive been eating at yama sushi for 7 years nearly every week i would say 40 time a year thats nearly 300 times in 7 years
from the amazing drinks all down to the staff
they pride themsevles in the service they provide  their service is truly exceptional
no offense to the service here
the food is delicious
talk about value
they were good but not great
i got juice the greengo and everyone was green with envy ha see what i did there
lol cheap tasty and the perfect way to get your vegas buzz on from the getgo
das fllt stark ab
fatz is not bad compared to other chains especially applebees which is just an insult to the restaurant industry
she made some good recommendations for my wifes drinks
by ridiculous i mean ridiculously awesome
la musique tait juste assez forte et agrable
i went to this restaurant on mothers day afternoon but because of the lineup i decided to return instead today monday
i wanted to try something different so i had the chicken sandwich jerk style because the waitress confirmed that it was really good and my husband had the fredonia dip
things move a bit slowly here so go in knowing that this will be a leisurely dinner
this is a 6500 grilled ribeye steak
the food is fresh and good
not only do they have a wide selection of beer on tap their food menu is extensive offering a variety of delicious appetizers entrees wings burgers and more along with a daily lineup of specials
this is a lovely bar surrounded by lovely edinburgh countryside
once my meal is through i go next door to the booze joint buy a bottle of dessert then slam it once i get home
i chose to sub the beef patty with a veggie burger and that was an awesome desision
although i didnt try the burger my boyfriend said that it was nice and juicy  although nothing super special flavour wise
last time in vegas the food was great place was clean and service superb  not anymore
that is a must have
service was top notch but for this price point i would expect it to be
i had a beer with a hit of mandarin orange which was amazing
its just that if youre a vegetarian and want dinner here youre probably going to order the veggie burger and if you have any taste buds youre probably going to be disappointed
the spinach salad with bacon dressing was ok the menu says hard boiled eggs chopped bacon and bleu cheese are in it but you would be hard pressed to find any
our favorites were the hamachi appetizer  the white lotus roll
i always get the peanut butter bowl and its the best
its not called the bier market for nothing
the staff is always so friendly here
the wings were tainted and gave me a bad case of food poisoning
who knows if the poor place will go under once citycenter is entirely built and it covers the monte carlo in with its omnipotent shadow
the service was horrible
love this place
after i tasted the desserts and croissants and had a non welcoming experience i decided not to return to that place or recommend it to any of my friends
the lighting and chandelier setup was amazing
unfortunately my boyfriend does not carry ear plugs or a man purse to put them in
if a dirty living room full of hipsters is your scene this is the bar for you
we had dinner here before the charlotte nascar
then i also had the curry shrimp which was different but the flavors were very good with the baguette
which was nice
both came with garlic dipping sauce yum
thats a rhetorical question lastly the atmosphere is always informal and alive
its a shame since we love the original in south park
i particularly recommend the dragon roll
although this shop is a little out of the way from where i live it surely lives up to the expectations that were illustrated on yelp
the veggie plate was very very very minimal and not fresh
was a bit too crowded for my taste and we had to sit on the end of another group of peoples table but we had a good night
love it here
there is definitely a lot going on in each of the dishes but it never feels like too much
i ordered the dolsat bibimbap i think i spelled this right
they have foosball pool darts and shuffleboard to keep you entertained which is great
the ipa is perfect
i got the pho here and it was really good
they both had a hint of indian spice flavor
the rolls are pretty good and they will also make some stuff for you that is off the menu if youre there long enough
there were various beer signs and televisions mounted on the wall with the games playing on them
the pork belly was a thick cut tender and flavorful and the steamed buns were soft and warm
elses the place to be
once we arrived we asked to sit in that section
on our way out an employee ran after us asking if we would like to speak to a manager as she noticed how rudely  we were being treated
i dont even go to fou founes electriques anymore
we had many floating sushi restaurants in outlast state we lived in and are happy to have one in the valley
like were talking 8 spicy tuna rolls
eggspectation started in 1993 in montreal and now has locations throughout canada a few in the us india and dubai
as someone who eats sushi 2x per week in the sushi mecca i have to recommend this spot
for beers like this freshness is everything so getting bottle versions from germany definitely lose something on the trip over
and youll be even more unhappy about the cost when you find out youre not getting the happy hour deals you thought you were ordering
she only waited for one of us to order and then walked away
and the combo fried dill pickles and onion straws
at the entrance of the buffet it smelled like sewer we were grossed out but wanted to give it a try
the bartenders were each taking turns excusing themselves to use their phones not permitted on the floor
the place itself is small and uncomfortable but clean
located next to caffe gelato in the bocapark mall you walk into this pleasant and bright japanese restaurant
you can also get a piece of meat such as chicken or fish with a side say mashed potatoes and the salad bar
12 bucks for a burger well worth it and 45 bucks for lunch for two with tipno alcohol is too much to make us regulars but for a nice lunch on a whim we will definitely be back
that ended up being a good thing
it is a generous portion of both
dont go hear its not worth your time and money
i got the pittsburgher and it was sooooo yummyprobably because of its name  lol
cant believe this place hasnt been reviewed yet
we didnt stay very long just because we stopped in for one drink but the atmosphere great cocktails and friendly service would have me keep coming back again and again
he also advised us against ordering a bunch of dishes and recommended that we order course by course if we were still hungry after our first selection
it is a burger with bacon mushrooms and gruyere cheese
i tried to go once with my friend and we were 15 mins late
i was also disappointed that not an anniversary dessert was given to us considering we had started it to our hostess and on the reservations
i eat here all the time and only wish they were open on sundays too
however we waited almost 45 minutes for our food during which time our waitress pretty much ignored us entirely
i only come here for happy hourlove their happy hour food and prices this was the first ra i went to before they opened up the socal locations
it felt like we were in her way
he said he couldnt find any but went to the bathroom and pulled out some toilet paper for me
pregame first and youll be dandy
they utilize some rewards app that ive never heard of
are they any cheaper without the olive
that looks right at home in the 1970s and the whole club feels like they are bringing back the look and style of the 1970s and 1980s and they did a great job with it
much better quality food than i expected for the prices
i give this place a 10 i will be back soon with wifey when she get heremahalo oyshi
disgusted i requested for a new room immediately
both were huge and amazing
the waiter was spot on attentive but not smothering caleb
there is nothing that stands out and apart from it being a smallish bar on bathurst i usually prefer to go to the wheat sheaf for a more lively atmosphere and a patio where i can breathe in more exhaust fumes
the team work in this place is amazing
my second visit was an entirely different experience
what i do recall specifically is that our server drew was the paragon of customer service
the music is too loud
dont know if ill be back to try their sandwiches
his only two minor complaints ware there are no toothpicks at the bloody mary bar to put his goodies on so all his accouterments fell to the bottom of the glass
we tried 3 different desserts  the sorbet as a starter i was disappointed
not just the best snow cones everthey also have ice cream and fresh fruit
when i started to be rude back to him suddenly it was like he remembered what his job was and he started be obsequious
one member of our party had to wait anywhere between 25 and 40 minutes for her food very long waits for vegetable tempura and frustrating when people that ordered after her got their food within 5 minutes
great bar friendly staff
thats not to say theyre a lively bunch because theyre not really moving or doing much but they arent dead and they are there drinking beer and seeming to be grouchier than you are
i love talking to bartenders not in a creepy way but so that i can hear all about what theyre working on and what they have planned for the next great drink
ive been to the location in tempe which is typically pretty good
would i eat here again
so she ended up paying full price anyways
anyway the wings were electrifying i got the sweet escape with extra hot
